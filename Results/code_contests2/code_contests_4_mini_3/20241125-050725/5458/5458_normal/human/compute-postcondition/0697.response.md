Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute the statements within the if block. Therefore, the state of `dp` remains unchanged if `j` is less than or equal to `k`.***
