According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, since `s` is at least 2, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 3 for the loop to run again.

Therefore, the adjusted states will reflect that `k` is now 3, and `s` should be at least 3 to allow the loop to execute once more.

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 3**
