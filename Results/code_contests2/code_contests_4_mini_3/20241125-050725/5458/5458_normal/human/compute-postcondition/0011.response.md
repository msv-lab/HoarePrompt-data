In the given code snippet, the operation assigns a value of `1` to a specific index of the `dp` 2D list. The indices are calculated as follows:

- The first index is `(i + 1) & 1`, which will cycle between `0` and `1` depending on whether `i` is `0` or `1` (since the bitwise AND with `1` gives the least significant bit).
- The second index is `(j + 1)`, which will be `2` since `j` is `1`.
- The third index is `k`, which is `1`.

Since `i` is `0`, `(i + 1) & 1` results in `1`. Therefore, the assignment will be to `dp[1][2][1]`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `n` is at least `1` (not directly affected).
- `i` is `0`.
- `m` is at least `1` (not directly affected).
- `s` is at least `1` (not directly affected).
- `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(2) x (m + 2)` and each inner list is of size `(s + 1)`, suggesting it is large enough to accommodate the index `dp[1][2][1]`.
- `j` is `1`.
- `k` is `1`.

The operation modifies `dp[1][2][1]` to `1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
