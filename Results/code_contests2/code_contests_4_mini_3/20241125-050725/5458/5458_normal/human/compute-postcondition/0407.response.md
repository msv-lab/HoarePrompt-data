The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The initial states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated with the assignment from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k].
