According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s`, and for it to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 2.

Since `k` starts at 1 and will be incremented in the next iteration, the previous states for `k` must reflect that it is now 2. Thus, the states to be adjusted are:

- `k` should be adjusted to 2.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged since it is at least 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and `k` is 2.**
