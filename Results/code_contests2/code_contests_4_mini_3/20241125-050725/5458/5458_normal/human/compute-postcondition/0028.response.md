The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` suggests that we are updating the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Given that `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged since the condition specifies that it does not change when this is true.

In this case, `dp` is not affected by the operation due to the condition regarding `j` and `k`. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `s`, and `k`) are provided but not directly altered by this operation either.

Thus, since `dp` remains unchanged and other variables retain their initial values, the output state reflects the unchanged condition of `dp`.

Output State: **If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged; `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`.**
