The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, and we do not exit any loop or function. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program continues to the next iteration without any modifications to the current state of variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and dp[0][j + 1][1] is assigned the value from dp[0][j][1], and we continue to the next iteration.**
