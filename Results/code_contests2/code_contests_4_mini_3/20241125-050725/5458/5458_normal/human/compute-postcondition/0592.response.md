The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
