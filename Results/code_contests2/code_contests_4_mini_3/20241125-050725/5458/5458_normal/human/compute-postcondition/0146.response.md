According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is currently at its last value (which is `m` at maximum), and the loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `m`. 

Since the loop statement specifies `for j in xrange(1, m + 1)`, the valid values for `j` are from 1 to `m`. If `j` is currently at `m`, it needs to be adjusted to `m + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is less than 1, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
