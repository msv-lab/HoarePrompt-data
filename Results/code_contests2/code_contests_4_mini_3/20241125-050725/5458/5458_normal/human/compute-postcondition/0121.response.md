The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on [i + 1 & 1][j][k]; `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
