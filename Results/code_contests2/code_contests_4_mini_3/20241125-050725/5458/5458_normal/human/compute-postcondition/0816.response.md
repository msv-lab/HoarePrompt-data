The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the value of a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The indices used to access the array are calculated as follows:

- The first index is `i + 1 & 1`, which means we will take the value of `i`, add 1 to it, and perform a bitwise AND operation with 1. This operation effectively results in either 0 or 1 based on whether `i` is even or odd.
- The second index is `j + 1`, which means we are incrementing `j` by 1.
- The third index is `k`, which is given to be 3.

The initial values provided (`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 3) do not directly affect the assignment to `dp`, but they indicate that `j` will be incremented by 1 (thus it will still be valid for whatever length `dp` might have).

Since we do not have specific values for `i`, `j`, or the structure of `dp`, we can state that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1**
