Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, where `i` is an unknown index. There is no else part in the code, so no changes occur if `j` is less than `k`.***
