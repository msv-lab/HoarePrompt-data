According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for `k` in the range from 1 to `s`, which means it will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has not been explicitly stated but must be at least 1, and `s` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` must be less than `s`. Therefore, if `k` is currently equal to `s`, we need to adjust `s` to be at least 2 (to allow for one more iteration) and increase `k` to `k + 1` (to prepare for the next iteration). 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 1**
