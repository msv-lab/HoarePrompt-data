Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds based on the remaining logic after the if statement.***
