According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still less than `n`, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 while ensuring that it is still less than `n ** 2`. 

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`, which should be updated from its current value (less than `n`) to the next integer value (still less than `n ** 2`).

State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is not defined**
