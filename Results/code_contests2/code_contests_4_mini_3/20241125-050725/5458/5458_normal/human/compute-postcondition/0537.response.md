According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is currently at its final value, which is `m`, since the loop runs from 1 to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to `m + 1`.

State: **`s` is 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`**
