The value of `i` is 0, and when we calculate `i + 1`, it becomes 1. The value of `j` is at least 1, so when we calculate `j + 1`, it will be at least 2. The value of `k` is 1. Thus, we are assigning a value of 1 to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`. Other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unaffected in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
