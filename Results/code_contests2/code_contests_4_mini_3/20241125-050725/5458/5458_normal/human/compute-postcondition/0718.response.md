Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k` and the else part is executed, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is modified based on the values from `dp[1][j][3]` and `dp[0][j][k - j]`, ensuring that the calculations respect modular arithmetic with a specified modulus. In summary, the modifications to the `dp` array depend on the value of `j` in relation to `k`, with specific assignments occurring based on these comparisons.***
