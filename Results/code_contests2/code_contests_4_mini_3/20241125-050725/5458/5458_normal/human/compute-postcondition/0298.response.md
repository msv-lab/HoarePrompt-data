Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` is determined by the values of `i`, `k` (where `k` is 1), `s` (which is greater than or equal to 1), and `m` (which is greater than or equal to 2). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` remains unchanged. In the else case, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures all cases and edge conditions are accounted for, particularly with respect to the values of `j` in relation to `k`.***
