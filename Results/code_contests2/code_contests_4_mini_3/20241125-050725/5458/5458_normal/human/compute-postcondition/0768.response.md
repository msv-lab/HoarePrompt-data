Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2), `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no updates are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without changes to the relevant indices.***
