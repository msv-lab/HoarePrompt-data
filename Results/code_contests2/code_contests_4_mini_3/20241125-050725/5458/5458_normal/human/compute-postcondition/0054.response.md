Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and if `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the `dp` array. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, reflecting both the state where `j` is less than or equal to `k` and where `j` is greater than `k`.***
