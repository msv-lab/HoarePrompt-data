According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, as the loop was iterating from `1` to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `s + 1`.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `s`, k is `s + 1`**
