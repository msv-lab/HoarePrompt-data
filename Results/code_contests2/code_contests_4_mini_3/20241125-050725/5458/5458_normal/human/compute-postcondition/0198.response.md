The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without making any changes to the existing variables.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
