The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
