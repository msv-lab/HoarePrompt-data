According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Since the loop will iterate from `0` to `n ** 2 - 1`, the next iteration will occur if `i` is less than `n ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, if `i` is currently at `n ** 2 - 1`, we need to increment `i` to `n ** 2` for the loop to terminate. 

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` incremented by 1, indicating that it will no longer satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n ** 2`**
