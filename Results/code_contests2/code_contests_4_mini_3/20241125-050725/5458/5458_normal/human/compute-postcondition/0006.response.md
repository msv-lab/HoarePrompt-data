According to the code, the loop iterates `n ** 2` times. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, since `n ** 2` needs to be greater than 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1, which implies that `i` will start from 0 and will range from 0 up to `n ** 2 - 1` during the iterations. 

To summarize, we need to adjust the states so that:
- `n` is at least 1 (to ensure that the loop can execute),
- `i` starts at 0 (the initial value of the loop index).

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer within its range, `s` is an integer within its range, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) and each inner list is of size (s + 1)**
