Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made, and the next steps will be determined by subsequent iterations of the loop.***
