Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, and if `i` is equal to 0, then since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that all cases where `j` is compared to `k` are handled, including the necessary modulo operations.***
