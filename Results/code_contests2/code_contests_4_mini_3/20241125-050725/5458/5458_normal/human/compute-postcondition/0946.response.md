The code modifies a multidimensional array `dp` at the index specified by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

- The value of `i` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to:
  - If `i` is 0: `0 + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1` which is `1`.
  - If `i` is 1: `1 + 1 & 1` results in `2 & 1` which is `0`.
  
- The value of `j` is 3, so `j + 1` is `4`.
- The value of `k` is 2.

Thus, the affected indices in `dp` will be:
- If `i` is 0: `dp[1][4][2] = 1`
- If `i` is 1: `dp[0][4][2] = 1`

The states of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `dp` is modified at indices depending on `i`.**
