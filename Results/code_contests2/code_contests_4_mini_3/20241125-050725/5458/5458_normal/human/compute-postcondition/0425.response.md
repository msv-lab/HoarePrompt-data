The code snippet contains a `continue` statement, which causes the current iteration of a loop to skip the remaining code and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and no assignments or modifications are made to them. Therefore, the output state reflects that the state of the variables remains the same, while indicating that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
