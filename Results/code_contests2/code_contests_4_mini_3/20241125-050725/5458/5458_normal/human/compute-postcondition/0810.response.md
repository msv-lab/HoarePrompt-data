The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1 (incremented by 1), `k` is 2, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration.**
