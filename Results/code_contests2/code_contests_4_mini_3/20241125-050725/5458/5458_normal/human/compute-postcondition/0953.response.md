Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, the function continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `dp`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is updated based on the values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` and `dp[i][3][0]`, ensuring that the respective indices in the `dp` array reflect the calculations made based on the values of `j` and `k`.***
