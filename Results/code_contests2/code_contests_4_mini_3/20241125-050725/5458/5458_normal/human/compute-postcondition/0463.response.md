Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not modify `dp` and proceeds without any changes to its state.***
