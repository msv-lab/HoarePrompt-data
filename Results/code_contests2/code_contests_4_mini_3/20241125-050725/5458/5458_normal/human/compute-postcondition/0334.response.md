The code snippet assigns a value of `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

- Here, `i` is `0`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. 
- The variable `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` becomes `2`. 
- The variable `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment will be executed as `dp[1][2][1] = 1`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1**.
