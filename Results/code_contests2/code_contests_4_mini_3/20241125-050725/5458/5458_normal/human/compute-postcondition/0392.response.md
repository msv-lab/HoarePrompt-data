Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without executing the block of code within the if statement.***
