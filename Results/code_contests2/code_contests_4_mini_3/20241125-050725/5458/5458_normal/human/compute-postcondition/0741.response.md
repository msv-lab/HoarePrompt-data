The expression modifies the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The specific indices involved are `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is derived from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is taken modulo `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
