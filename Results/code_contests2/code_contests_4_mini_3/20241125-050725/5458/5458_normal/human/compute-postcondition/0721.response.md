According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `m` greater than or equal to 2. This means that the loop has executed at least once (for `j = 1`), and will execute again if `j` can take the next value.

Since the loop starts at `j = 1`, and the condition for the loop is `j <= m`, if `m` is greater than 1, the next value of `j` will be 2. Thus, we need to adjust `j` to represent the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be updated to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2**
