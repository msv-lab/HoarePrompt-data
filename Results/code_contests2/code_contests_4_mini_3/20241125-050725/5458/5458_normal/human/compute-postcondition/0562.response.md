Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then there are no changes to `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value. All updates to `dp` maintain its defined state based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
