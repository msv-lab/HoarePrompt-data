According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The loop iterates through values of `k` starting from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` is 3. Since `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is incremented to 4.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be 4. The other states (`s`, `j`, and `m`) do not need to be changed because they are already sufficient for the loop execution.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 4**
