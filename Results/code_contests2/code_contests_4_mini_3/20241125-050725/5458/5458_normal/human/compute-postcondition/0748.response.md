The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
