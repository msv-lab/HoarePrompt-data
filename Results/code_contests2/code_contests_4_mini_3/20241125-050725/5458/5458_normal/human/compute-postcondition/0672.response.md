Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no updates are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop without any change to the `dp` structure.***
