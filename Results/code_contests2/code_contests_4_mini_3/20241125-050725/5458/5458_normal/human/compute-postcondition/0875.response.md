The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The initial state indicates that `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k` are all at least 1, while `j` is greater than 1. The specific values of these variables influence the calculation of `dp`, but since they are not provided, we can only state the relationship.

The operation updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the current values in the `dp` array, specifically using `k - j`, which must also be at least 1 due to the initial state conditions. However, we do not have the exact values of `dp` before the operation.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes made to `dp` without specifying exact numerical values.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
