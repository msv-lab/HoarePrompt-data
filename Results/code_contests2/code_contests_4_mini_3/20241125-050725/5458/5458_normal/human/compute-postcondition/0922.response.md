Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, reflecting the update based on the value of `i`. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. Thus, the postcondition captures the potential update to `dp` when the condition on `j` is satisfied, while retaining the constraints on all other variables.***
