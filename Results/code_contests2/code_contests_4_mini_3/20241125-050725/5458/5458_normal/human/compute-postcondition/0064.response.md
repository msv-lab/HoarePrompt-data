According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and it is given that `s` is at least 1, meaning `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `s` needs to be at least 3, and `k` must be incremented to 3.

State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
