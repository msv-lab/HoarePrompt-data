Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 3), then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the `dp` array.***
