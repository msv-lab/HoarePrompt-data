According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1, because `xrange(1, m + 1)` will generate a range starting from 1 to `m`, inclusive. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0 before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `m` is also at least 1 for the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be equal to `m`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
