Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and subsequently, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In all cases, the program modifies the `dp` array based on the conditions regarding `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
