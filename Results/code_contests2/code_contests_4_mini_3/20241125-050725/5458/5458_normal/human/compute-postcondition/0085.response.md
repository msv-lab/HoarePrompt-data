Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program would skip the assignment and continue execution, maintaining the original values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
