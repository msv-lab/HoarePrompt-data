Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to the `dp` array. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and also receives an addition from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, covering all cases for the given conditions.***
