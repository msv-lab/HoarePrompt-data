The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
