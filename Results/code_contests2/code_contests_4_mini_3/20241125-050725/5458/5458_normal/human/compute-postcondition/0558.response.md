The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed. This statement causes the program to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same, reflecting the unchanged values of the variables. 

Output State: **`s` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
