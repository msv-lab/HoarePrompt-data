The code assigns the value of `1` to the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Here, `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` becomes `1`. The expression `1 & 1` results in `1` (since both are binary `1`). The value of `j` is `m + 1`, but since `m` is not given a specific value, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, we know `j + 1` will be `m + 2`. The value of `k` is `3`. 

Since we do not have specific values for `m`, we cannot precisely state the indices involved in the `dp` array. Nevertheless, the assignment does not change the values of `i`, `j`, `s`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the assignment operation:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is assigned the value 1**
