Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any action.***
