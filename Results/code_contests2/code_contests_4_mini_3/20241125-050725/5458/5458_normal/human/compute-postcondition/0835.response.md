The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
