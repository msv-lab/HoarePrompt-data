The line of code updates the `dp` array based on the condition of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Specifically, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `k` is determined to be `s + 1`, and both `s` and `m` are greater than or equal to 2.

Since the specific previous values of `dp` are not given, we can only describe the assignment operation. The output state reveals that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value from a previous position in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
