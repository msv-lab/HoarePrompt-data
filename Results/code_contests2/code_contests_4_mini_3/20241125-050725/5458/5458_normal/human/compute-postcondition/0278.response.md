The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it instructs the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the loop's control flow. The variables `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` retain their current values as specified.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
