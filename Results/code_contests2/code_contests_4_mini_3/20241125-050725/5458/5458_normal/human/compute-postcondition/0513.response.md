Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`, and the program proceeds without any effect on the state.***
