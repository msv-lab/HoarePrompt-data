Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than 3, then there are no changes to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]` and additionally adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][3 - j]`.***
