Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1. `k` will take on values from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop does not execute if `s` is less than 1, which would leave `k` undefined and the `dp` array unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is equal to `k`, the same logic applies as in the else condition, updating `dp` based on the defined conditions.**
