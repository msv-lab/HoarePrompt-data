Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remain unaffected. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur in the state of `dp`.***
