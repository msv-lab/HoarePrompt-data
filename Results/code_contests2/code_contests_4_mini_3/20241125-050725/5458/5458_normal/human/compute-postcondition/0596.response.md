Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and also increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This ensures that all cases regarding the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are accounted for and handled appropriately.***
