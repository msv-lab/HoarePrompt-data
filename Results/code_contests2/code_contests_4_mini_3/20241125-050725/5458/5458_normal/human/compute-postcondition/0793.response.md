According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`, which is already satisfied in the provided state. 

The variable `k` will be initialized to `1` at the start of the loop. The loop's execution will not depend on `n`, `m`, or `j` directly, but we need to ensure that `k` starts at `1` for the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following states can be captured:

State: **`s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1**
