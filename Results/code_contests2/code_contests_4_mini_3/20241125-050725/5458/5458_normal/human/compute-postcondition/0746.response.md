Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. There are no other conditions affecting the outcome, and the state of the program remains unchanged if `j` is less than `k`.***
