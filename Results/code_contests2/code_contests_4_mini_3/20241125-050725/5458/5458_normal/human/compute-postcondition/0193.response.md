Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` remains unchanged except for `dp[1][3][1]`, which is set to 1 when `i` is 0 and `j` (2) is greater than or equal to `k` (1). If `i` is a positive integer, `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]`, and if `j` (2) is greater than `k` (1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]` modulo `mod` and also includes `dp[i & 1][2][0]` modulo `mod`. Note that accessing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` may lead to invalid access if `k - j` is negative, which should be handled in the implementation. Overall, the values of `k`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged with `k` being 1, `i` either 0 or a positive integer, and `m` being at least 2.***
