According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and `s` must still be greater than or equal to 2 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1**
