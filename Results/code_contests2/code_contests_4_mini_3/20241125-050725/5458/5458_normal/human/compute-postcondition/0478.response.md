The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The impact is that the loop continues without executing any subsequent code within the loop for the current iteration.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variables. `s`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `i` retain their initial states, and the loop just continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
