The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 3, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
