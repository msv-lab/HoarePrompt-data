The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` yields either `0` or `1` depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is either `0` or `1`, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` when `i` is `0`, and `0` when `i` is `1`. The indices `j` and `k` are also used to reference the `dp` array.

The output state depends on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, but the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
