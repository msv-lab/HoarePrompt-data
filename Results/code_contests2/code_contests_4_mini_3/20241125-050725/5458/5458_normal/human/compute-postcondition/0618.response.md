Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the state of the program remains unchanged, as there is no else part handling that condition.***
