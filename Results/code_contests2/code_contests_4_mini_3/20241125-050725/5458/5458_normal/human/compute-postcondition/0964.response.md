Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is between 1 and `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][k]` is set to 1 for each `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][4][k]` is updated to `dp[1][3][k]`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][k]` is updated to `dp[1][3][k] % mod + dp[0][3][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and values of `dp` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
