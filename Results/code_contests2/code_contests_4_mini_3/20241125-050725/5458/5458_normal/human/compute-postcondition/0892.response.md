To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state of the variables.

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is at least 1
- `m` is at least 1
- `s` is at least 2
- `i` is either 0 or 1
- `j` is at least 1
- `k` is 2

The code snippet is:
```
dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod
```

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `1` (if `i` is `0`, because `1 & 1 = 1`) or `0` (if `i` is `1`, because `2 & 1 = 0`).
2. The value of `j + 1` will be at least `2` since `j` is at least `1`.
3. The value of `k` is `2`.

Now, we need to check the condition `if j > k`. Since `j` is at least `1` and `k` is `2`, `j` can only be greater than `k` if `j` is greater than `2`. However, since `j` is only guaranteed to be at least `1`, we cannot determine if it is greater than `k` without specific values.

However, if `j` is not greater than `k`, which is likely since `k` is `2`, no changes are made to the variables, and we will continue with the current state.

Therefore, if `j` is not greater than `k`, the output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and no changes were made to the state of the variables.**
