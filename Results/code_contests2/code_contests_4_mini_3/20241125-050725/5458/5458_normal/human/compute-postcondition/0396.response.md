According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` should be incremented to 4, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4**
