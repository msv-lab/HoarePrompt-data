Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) filled with zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k] % mod`. In the case where `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k] % mod` and then increased by `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. All updates to `dp` respect the modular arithmetic with `mod`, ensuring the values remain within the expected range.***
