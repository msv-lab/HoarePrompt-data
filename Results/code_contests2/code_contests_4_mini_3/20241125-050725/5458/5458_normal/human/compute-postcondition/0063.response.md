Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` added to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The program ensures that all operations respect the boundaries of the `dp` array, avoiding any out-of-bounds errors.***
