To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given state and the loop condition.

1. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to take on the next value in this range.
2. The current value of `k` at the end of the last iteration is `1` (as stated in the previous state).
3. The loop will execute again if `k` can be incremented to `2`, which is still within the range (since `s + 1` must be greater than or equal to `2` for this to happen).

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state would be as follows:
- `k` needs to be incremented from `1` to `2`.
- The value of `s` must be at least `1` to ensure the loop condition allows for `k` to take on the value `2`.

Given this analysis, the adjusted state will reflect that `k` is now `2` and that `s` is at least `1`.

State: **`dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1**
