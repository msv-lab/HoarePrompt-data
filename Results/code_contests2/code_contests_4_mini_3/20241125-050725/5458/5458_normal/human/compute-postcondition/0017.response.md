Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is larger than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) and each inner list is of size (s + 1). If `j` is greater than `k`, specifically when `j` is 1 and `k` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes to `dp` occur and the program proceeds accordingly.***
