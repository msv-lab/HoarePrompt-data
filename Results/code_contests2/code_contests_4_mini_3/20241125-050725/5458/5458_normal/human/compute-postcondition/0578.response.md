The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves a bitwise AND operation, which affects the indices used to access the `dp` array. 

1. The operation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates the value of `i + 1` first. Given `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1. The operation `1 & 1` results in 1. Therefore, the first index in the `dp` array is 1.
2. The second index `j + 1` is calculated next. Since `j` is 2, `j + 1` equals 3.
3. The third index is simply `k`, which is 1.

The line of code assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][3][1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Now, let's summarize the output state:

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1**.
