The code snippet modifies a multidimensional array `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The operation does not change the values of `s`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `i`. However, it sets the value of `dp` at the specified indices to `1`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` at the time of execution are `0`, at least `1`, and `3`, respectively. 

Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. The value of `j` is at least `1`, so `j + 1` is at least `2`. The value of `k` remains `3`. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to `1`.

Since only the `dp` array is affected and no other variables change, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1**
