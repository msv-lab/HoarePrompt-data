Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp[1][m + 2][3]`. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is computed as the remainder of `dp[1][j][k]` divided by `mod` and is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[0][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. This ensures that all variations of `j` with respect to `k` are covered, leading to potential updates in the `dp` array based on the given conditions.***
