The `continue` statement does not change any variable values, but it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and a value is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
