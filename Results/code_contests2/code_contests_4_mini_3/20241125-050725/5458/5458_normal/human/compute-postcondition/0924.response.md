The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it instructs the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
