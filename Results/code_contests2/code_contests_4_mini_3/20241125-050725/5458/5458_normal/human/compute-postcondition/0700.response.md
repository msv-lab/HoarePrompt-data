Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The value of `j` must be at least 1 when `i` is 0 and can be between 0 and `k` for the other cases.***
