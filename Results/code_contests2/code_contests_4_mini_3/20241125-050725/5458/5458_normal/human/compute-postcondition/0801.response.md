The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the control to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
