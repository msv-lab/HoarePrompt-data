Postcondition: ***`s` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not modify `dp` or the loop's control variables.***
