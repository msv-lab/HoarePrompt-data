The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value from the `dp` list to another position in the same list. The operation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates the expression by first calculating `i + 1`, which is greater than 0, and then performing a bitwise AND operation with `1`. This means the result will be either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i` is odd or even.

The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains unchanged, and the value from that position is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The dimensions of `dp` and the indices used ensure that this assignment operates correctly within the bounds of the 2D list.

Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, we note that the program modifies the `dp` list based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, but we cannot specify the exact output states for those variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is modified at specific indices, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
