The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that we are assigning a value from one index of a 3D array `dp` to another. Here, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 + 1 & 1`, which is `2 & 1`, resulting in `0` (because `2` in binary is `10`, and `1` in binary is `01`, so the bitwise AND results in `00`).
2. The expression `j + 1` results in at least `3` (since `j` is at least `2`).
3. The variable `k` remains `1`.

Thus, we are assigning the value from `dp[0][j][1]` to `dp[0][j + 1][1]`. The assignment does not change `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, but it modifies the `dp` array.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, and notes that a value from the `dp` array is assigned.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `m`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and dp[0][j + 1][1] is assigned the value from dp[0][j][1]**
