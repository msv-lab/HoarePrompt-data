In the initial state, `j` is 3, and `k` is also 3. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the condition to assign a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not met, and no changes are made to `dp`. The program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop without affecting any variable states. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and no changes are made to `dp`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and no changes are made to `dp`.**
