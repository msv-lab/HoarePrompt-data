Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no modification to `dp` or change in state, and control proceeds beyond the if statement, potentially handling other cases.***
