Postcondition: ***If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration. Since `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`, these conditions hold true throughout the execution of the program.***
