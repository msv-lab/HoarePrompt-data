According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to and including `s`. 

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1, these states do not directly affect the execution of the loop. The states of `i` and `j` are not relevant to the loop execution either.

For the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `s` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the loop, `k` should be initialized to 1, representing the first value in the range.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
