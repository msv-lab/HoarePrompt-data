Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to match `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while the state of other variables remains unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any code within the if block, and all values retain their initial state.***
