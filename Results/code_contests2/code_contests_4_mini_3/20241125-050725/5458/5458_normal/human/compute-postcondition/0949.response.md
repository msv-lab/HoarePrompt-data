The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that we will skip to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
