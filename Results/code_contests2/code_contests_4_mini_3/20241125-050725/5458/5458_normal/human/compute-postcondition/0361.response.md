Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. In all other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, ensuring that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is correctly computed while respecting the modulus operation.***
