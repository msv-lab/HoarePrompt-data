The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is present. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
