Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2). If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged; for each execution of the outer loop (for `j`), if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` equals `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains filled with zeros.**
