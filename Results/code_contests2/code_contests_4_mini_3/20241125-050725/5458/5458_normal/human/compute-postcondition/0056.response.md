The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the multidimensional array `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1]`, `[j + 1]`, and `[k]`. The values of `j` and `k` are known, with `j` being `m + 1` (which is at least 3) and `k` being `2`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` depends on the value of `i`, which is not provided. 

Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `i + 1 & 1`, but we can note that it will result in either `0` or `1`, affecting the first index of the `dp` array. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the known values and the assignment operation, while acknowledging the uncertainty with respect to `i`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
