The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change as a result of this operation; however, the value of `j` is calculated as `m + 1` and is greater than `k`, which is 1. The state of the other variables is not directly affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the output state remains as it was before the assignment, with the added implication of the assignment operation.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
