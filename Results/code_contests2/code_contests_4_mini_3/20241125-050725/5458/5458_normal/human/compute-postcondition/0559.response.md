Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the code does not execute the if block and moves on without modifying any variables related to `dp`.***
