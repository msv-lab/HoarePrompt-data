Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `j` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2; if `j > k`, `dp` remains unchanged and the program continues to the next iteration; if `j <= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
