The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `s`, `j`, `m`, and `k` are not directly modified by this assignment. The output state remains unchanged concerning the values of `s`, `j`, `m`, and `k`, but we note that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` now depends on the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
