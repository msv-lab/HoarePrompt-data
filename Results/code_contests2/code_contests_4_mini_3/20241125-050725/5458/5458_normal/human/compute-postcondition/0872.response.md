The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since it does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, and there is no loop context provided, the values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes occurred.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
