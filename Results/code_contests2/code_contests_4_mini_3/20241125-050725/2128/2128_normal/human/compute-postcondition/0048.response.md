Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the first `k` elements of `arr` (from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`), `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `ans` remains equal to `arr[0]`.**
