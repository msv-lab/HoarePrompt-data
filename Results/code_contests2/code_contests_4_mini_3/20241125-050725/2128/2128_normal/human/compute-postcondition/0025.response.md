According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `k`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state, we know that `k` is at least 1, which satisfies this requirement. 

Since `k` is not modified during the loop execution, we must also consider the value of `l` at the start of the loop, which will be initialized to 1 at the beginning of the first iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted before the loop starts is simply the initialization of `l`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`, `l` is 1**
