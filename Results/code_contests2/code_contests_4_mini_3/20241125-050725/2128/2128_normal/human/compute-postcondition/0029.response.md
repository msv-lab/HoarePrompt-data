According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` in relation to `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2 and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `k` is at least 3 for the loop to continue.

Since `k` is greater than 1, we need to adjust it to ensure that it is at least 3 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to the value of `ans + arr[2]`, `l` is 3**
