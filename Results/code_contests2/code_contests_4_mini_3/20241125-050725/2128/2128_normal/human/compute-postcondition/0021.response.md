The code assigns a sorted version of `arr` to `arr`, sorting it in descending order. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation, and the specific contents of `arr` are not given, only that it is a list of integers based on input. Therefore, after executing the code, `arr` will be a sorted list of its original values in reverse order. 

Output State: **`n` is updated from greater than 1, `k` is updated from at least 1; `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**
