The code increments the value of `ans` by `arr[l]`. The variable `l` is previously defined as `k + 1`, which means that `arr[l]` is accessing the element in the sorted array `arr` at the index `k + 1`. The output state will reflect that `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, but the exact value of `arr[l]` is unknown since the specific contents of `arr` are not provided. Therefore, the output state indicates the change to `ans` as well as the values of other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, `l` is `k + 1`**
