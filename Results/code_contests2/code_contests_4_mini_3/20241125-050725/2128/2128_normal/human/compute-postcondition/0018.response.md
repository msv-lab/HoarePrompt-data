According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is likely equal to `t - 1` (the last index), since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `t`, meaning the loop will not execute again unless `t` is incremented or modified. 

Since `t` is not mentioned to change, we can assume `t` needs to be greater than `t - 1` for the next iteration to take place. However, no other adjustments are indicated in the current state.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ans` is the sum of the largest element of `arr` and the elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, where `k` is at least 1, `i` is t, `t` is greater than 0**
