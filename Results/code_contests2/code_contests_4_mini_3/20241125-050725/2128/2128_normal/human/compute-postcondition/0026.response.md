The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 1, `arr[l]` refers to the second element of the sorted list `arr`, which is an integer. The value of `ans` was initially set to the first element of `arr`. The state of the other variables does not change. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `ans` as well as the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to the value of `ans + arr[1]`, `l` is 1**
