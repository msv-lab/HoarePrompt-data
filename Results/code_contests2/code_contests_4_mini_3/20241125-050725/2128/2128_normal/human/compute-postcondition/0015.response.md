According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the range defined in the loop. The loop iterates over `l` from `1` to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented to `k + 1`, which is outside the defined range.

Since the loop cannot execute again with the current state (as `l` is already at `k`), we need to adjust the states accordingly. `k` must remain at least `1` for the loop to have executed at least once. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` starts at `1` and can reach up to `k + 1`.

Thus, the adjusted state will have `l` as `k + 1`. 

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by `arr[k]`, `l` is `k + 1`**.
