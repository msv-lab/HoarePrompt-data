Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from standard input representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It sorts this list in descending order and computes the sum of the largest integer in the list and the first `k` largest integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it is adjusted to `n - 1` to prevent out-of-bounds access. The function then prints the result for each test case. If `t` is 0, no output is produced. Furthermore, if `n` is 1, the output is simply the largest element without any additional summation.**
