The variable `arr` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. This means that `arr` will hold a list of integers based on the input provided. The previous values of `ans`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `arr` based on user input.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
