According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 3 and `k` is greater than 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `l` must be incremented to 4. Additionally, to ensure the loop can still execute, `k` must be at least 4. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `k` to be greater than or equal to 4, and `l` to be 4 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 3, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to the value of `ans + arr[3]`, `l` is 4**
