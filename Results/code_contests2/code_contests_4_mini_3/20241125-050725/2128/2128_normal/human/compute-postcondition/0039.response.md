The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer. The initial state indicates that `n` can hold any integer value, and since `k` is calculated from `n`, `k` will be `n - 1`. The other variables `arr`, `ans`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `k` based on the input integer `n`.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the value of `arr[0]`, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`**
