The list `arr` is assigned the value of itself sorted in reverse order. The previous values of `arr` are not specified, but they will be sorted in descending order. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from input, and `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
