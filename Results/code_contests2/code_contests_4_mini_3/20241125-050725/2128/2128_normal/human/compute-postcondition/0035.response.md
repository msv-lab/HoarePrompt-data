The line of code takes input from the user, reading two integers from a single line and assigning them to the variables `n` and `k`. The previous state indicates that `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 0. However, the values of `n` and `k` are not known beforehand because they will be provided via input. The output state reflects the new assignments of `n` and `k`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers**
