According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `t` is not specified but assumed to be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop. 

State: **`ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0**
