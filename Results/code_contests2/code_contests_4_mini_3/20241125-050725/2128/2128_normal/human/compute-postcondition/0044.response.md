The code `ans += arr[l]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value at index `l` of the array `arr`. The previous value of `ans` is not explicitly provided, but we know that `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `l` is 2, meaning we are accessing the third largest element from the sorted array.

Since `arr[l]` represents the value at index 2 in the sorted array, and `ans` gets incremented by this value, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2**
