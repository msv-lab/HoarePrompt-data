The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` is the largest element of the array. The previous value of `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`, but after the execution of the code, `ans` is updated to the value of `arr[0]`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the value of `arr[0]`, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
