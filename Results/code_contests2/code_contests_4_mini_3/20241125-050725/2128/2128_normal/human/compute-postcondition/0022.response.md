`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the `arr` list, which, being sorted in descending order, is the largest element of the list. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is updated from greater than 1, `k` is updated from at least 1; `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is updated from greater than 1, `k` is updated from at least 1; `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is the first element of `arr`.**
