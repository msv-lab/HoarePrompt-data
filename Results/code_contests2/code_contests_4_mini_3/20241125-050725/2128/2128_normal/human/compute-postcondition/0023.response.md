The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `k` will be at least 1 (specifically, it will be one less than `n`). The values of `arr` and `ans` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is updated from greater than 1, `k` is updated from at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is updated from greater than 1, `k` is updated from at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`**
