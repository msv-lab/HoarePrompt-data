The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, where `l` is equal to `k`. The previous value of `arr[k]` is known but not specified, and `ans` is also previously defined but not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by `arr[k]`, and `l` is `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by `arr[k]`, `l` is `k`**
