The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

1. `t`: an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `n`: an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `k`: a non-negative integer.
4. `a`: a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) is non-negative and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

The function's output and return value are not specified in the provided details. Therefore, I cannot provide the return values or conditions. However, based on the parameter descriptions, I can summarize the functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `t` is an integer, `n` and `k` are integers with specified constraints, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers.**
