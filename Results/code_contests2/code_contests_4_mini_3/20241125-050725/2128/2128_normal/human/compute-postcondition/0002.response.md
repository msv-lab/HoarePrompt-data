The code assigns values to `n` and `k` by reading a line from standard input, splitting it into two parts, and converting those parts into integers. The values of `n` and `k` will be determined by the input provided. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 0 after execution.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from input**
