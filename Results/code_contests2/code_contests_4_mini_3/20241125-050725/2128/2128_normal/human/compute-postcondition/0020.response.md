The `arr` variable is assigned a list created from the input string, which is split into components and converted to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are not directly affected by this line, but `arr` will contain a list of integers derived from the input. Since `n` is updated from greater than 1 and `k` is updated from at least 1 based on input, we cannot determine the specific values of `arr`, but we know it will be a list of integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the state of `n`, `k`, and the new variable `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is updated from greater than 1, `k` is updated from at least 1; `arr` is a list of integers based on input**
