The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it. Since `l` is 2, the code accesses `arr[2]`. The previous state indicates that `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `n` and `k` are both greater than 1, but the specific values of these variables, as well as the specific content of `arr`, are not given. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `ans` while other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to the value of `ans + arr[2]`, `l` is 2**
