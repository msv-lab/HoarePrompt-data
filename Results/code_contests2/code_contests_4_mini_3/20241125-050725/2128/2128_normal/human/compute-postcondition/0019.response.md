The code assigns values to `n` and `k` by reading a line of input, splitting it by spaces, and converting the split values into integers. The previous states of `n` and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment, but they will now hold the values derived from the input. Since `n` is greater than 1 and `k` is at least 1, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` have been updated based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is updated from greater than 1 based on input, `k` is updated from at least 1 based on input**
