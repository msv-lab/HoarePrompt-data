The code snippet contains a print statement that outputs the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is stated to be the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`, the output will reflect the current value of `ans`. The other variables (`k`, `n`, and `arr`) are not directly modified by this operation.

Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is already calculated based on the sum of the first `k` elements, after executing the print statement, the output state will include the value of `ans` as it currently stands.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`**
