The line of code sorts the list `arr` in descending order. The previous state of the variables indicates that `arr` is a list of integers, and `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`. Sorting `arr` will change the order of its elements, but it does not impact the values of `ans`, `i`, `t`, `n`, or `k`.

After executing the code, `arr` will be rearranged, but the value of `ans` remains unchanged until further calculations are performed. Therefore, the output state reflects the new sorted order of `arr` while maintaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` starting from `arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
