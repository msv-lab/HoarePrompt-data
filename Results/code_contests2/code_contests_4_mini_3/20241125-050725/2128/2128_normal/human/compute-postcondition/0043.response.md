According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `l`, which iterates from 1 to `k + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 2, and we must ensure that `k` is still at least 2 to allow for the next iteration.

Since `k` is at least 1, we can adjust it to be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. The value of `l` will be updated to 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]`, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2**
