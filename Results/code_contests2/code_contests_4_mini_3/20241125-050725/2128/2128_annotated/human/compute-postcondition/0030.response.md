The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. The previous value of `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr` plus 2 * `arr[l]`. The values of `i`, `t`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is the new value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `arr[l]`, `k` is greater than the new value of `l`.

Output State: **`i` is the new value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `arr[l]`, `k` is greater than the new value of `l`**
