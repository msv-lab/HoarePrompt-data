According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is equal to `k + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `k + 1`, which is currently too high. Hence, `l` should be decreased to `k`. 

No other state variables need to be adjusted since `ans`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `k` remain unchanged and relevant to the current iteration.

State: **`ans` is updated to the new value after adding `arr[l]`, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n - 1`, `l` is equal to `k`**
