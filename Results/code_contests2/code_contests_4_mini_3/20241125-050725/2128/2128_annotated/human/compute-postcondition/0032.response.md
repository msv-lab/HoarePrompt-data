Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of the largest value in `arr` and the sum of elements `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1. If `k` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains equal to the largest value in `arr`. If `k` exceeds the length of `arr`, the loop will also not execute for those iterations beyond the length, and `ans` will still contain the largest value in `arr` plus any valid elements summed before reaching the length of the array.**
