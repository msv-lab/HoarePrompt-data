Postcondition: ***`ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr`, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`, ensuring `k` cannot exceed the maximum index of the array (which is `n - 1`); otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.***
