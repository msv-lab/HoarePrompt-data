According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is the new value (which is the previous `l` + 1), `k` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is at least 2, for the next iteration to be valid, `l` must be adjusted to `l` being less than or equal to `k`. 

This means that if `l` is currently equal to `k`, it will not be able to execute again, so in order for the loop to run one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than the new value of `l`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `k` needs to be greater than the new value of `l`.

State: **`i` is the new value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr` plus 2 * `arr[l]`, `k` is greater than the new value of `l`**
