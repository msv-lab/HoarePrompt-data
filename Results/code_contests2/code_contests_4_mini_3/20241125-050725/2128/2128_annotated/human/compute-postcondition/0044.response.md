The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. The previous value of `ans` is the largest value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`. Since `l` is equal to `k + 1`, `arr[l]` refers to the element at index `k + 1` in the sorted array. The value of `arr[l]` is known, and `ans` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the new value after adding `arr[l]`, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n - 1`, `l` is equal to `k + 1`**
