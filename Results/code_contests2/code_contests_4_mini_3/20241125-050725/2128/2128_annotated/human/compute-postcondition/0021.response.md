The code `arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)` sorts the list `arr` in descending order. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, as this operation only affects the list `arr`. The previous state of `arr` is not specified, but after sorting, it will contain the same elements in reverse order. Thus, the output state reflects the sorted state of `arr` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is the new value (previous i + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is sorted in descending order**
