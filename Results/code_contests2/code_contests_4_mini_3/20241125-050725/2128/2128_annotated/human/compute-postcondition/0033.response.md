Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of the largest value in `arr` and the sum of elements `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1. If `k` is 0 or less, `ans` remains equal to the largest value in `arr`. If `k` exceeds the length of `arr`, `ans` still contains the largest value in `arr` plus any valid elements summed before reaching the length of the array. The value of `ans` is printed.**
