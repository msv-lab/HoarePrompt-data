According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is assigned the value from `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, we need to ensure that the input read from standard input is a positive integer. Additionally, the loop variable `i` will start at 0 and will increment until it reaches `t - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` will initialize at 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
