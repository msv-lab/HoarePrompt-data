The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The previous value of `n` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. Other variables (`i`, `t`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is the new value (previous `i` + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr`, and `k` is equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is the new value (previous `i` + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr`, `k` is equal to `n - 1**
