The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` will be a specific value from the array. The value of `ans` is initially the largest value in `arr`. The previous values of the affected variables are `ans`, which is the largest value in `arr`, and `arr[l]`, which is an element from `arr`. Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` will be the sum of the largest value in `arr` and `arr[l]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans` is the largest value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n - 1**.
