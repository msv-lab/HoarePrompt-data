Output State: **`ans` is equal to the sum of the largest value in `arr` and the sum of elements `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` if `k` is at least 1; otherwise, `ans` equals the largest value in `arr`. If `k` exceeds the length of `arr`, `ans` contains the largest value in `arr` plus any valid elements summed before reaching the length of the array; `i` is equal to `t`, and `n` and `k` are input integers; `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
