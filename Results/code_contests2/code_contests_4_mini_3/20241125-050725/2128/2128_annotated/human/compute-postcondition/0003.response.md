The code creates a list `arr` by reading a line of input, splitting it into parts, and converting each part into an integer using `map`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line. The output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the creation of the new list `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of integers from input**
