According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l` and `k`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is `k + 1`, which is the upper limit of the loop and means it cannot execute again since the range function does not include the endpoint.

To enable the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be adjusted to the next value in the range, which would be `k + 1`. However, since `l` is already equal to `k + 1`, the loop will not execute again unless `k` is increased.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `k` is increased by at least 1 to allow `l` to take the value `k + 1` in the next iteration. Since `k` is at least 1, we can set it to at least 2 to ensure that the loop can run again, and consequently, `l` will also have to be adjusted to `k + 1`, which will now be at least 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2**
