The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is an input integer, `k` will be one less than that integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr`, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, and `arr` is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr`, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, and `arr` is sorted in descending order**.
