According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current value of `i` before the next iteration, and since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `t`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Since `t` is not provided but it is the upper limit of the loop, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be equal to the next value, which is 1 greater than the previous value of `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to increase by 1, and it must still be less than `t`.

State: **`i` is the new value (previous i + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`**
