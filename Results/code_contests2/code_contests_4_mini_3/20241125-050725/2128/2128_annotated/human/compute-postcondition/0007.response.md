The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is given as an input integer, the value of `k` will be one less than that of `n`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is the largest integer from `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is the largest integer from `arr`.**
