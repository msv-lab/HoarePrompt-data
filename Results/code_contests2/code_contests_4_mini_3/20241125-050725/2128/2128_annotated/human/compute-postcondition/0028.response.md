The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to its current value. The previous value of `ans` was equal to the largest value in `arr` plus the value of `arr[l]`, so after execution, `ans` will be the largest value in `arr` plus the value of `arr[l]` plus `arr[l]`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `t`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is the new value (previous `i` + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr` plus 2 * `arr[l]`, and `k` is at least 2.

Output State: **`i` is the new value (previous `i` + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr` plus 2 * `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 2**
