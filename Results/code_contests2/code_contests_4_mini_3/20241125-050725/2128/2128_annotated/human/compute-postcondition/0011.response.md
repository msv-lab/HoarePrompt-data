According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will iterate from `l = 1` to `l = k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` would have been incremented to a value of `k + 1`. 

Given that `k` is at least 1, this means the last value of `l` in the previous iteration would have been `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`, and `k` must remain at least 1.

The states that need adjustment are:
- `l` should be `k + 1` to reflect the next iteration.
- The state of `arr` and the condition on `k` remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is increased by `arr[k]`, `k` is at least 1, `l` is `k + 1`**
