The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation, but `arr` will contain the integers provided in the input. Since the initial state indicates that `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, the output state will reflect that `arr` now holds a list of integers while `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the new value (previous i + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is a list of integers from input**
