According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and its relationship with `k`. The range for `l` is from 1 to `k` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is equal to the current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n - 1`, it ensures that `k` is at least 1. If `l` is currently equal to `k`, the loop cannot execute again, and thus we need to adjust the condition of `l` to be less than `k`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `l` is now `k + 1` and that `l` needs to be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute at least one more time.

State: **`ans` is the largest value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n - 1, l is equal to k + 1`**
