According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, so for it to execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is the new value, `k` is greater than the new value of `l`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `arr[l]`, and `k` is greater than the new value of `l`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `l` must be incremented to the next value (which is the new value of `l` plus 1). Therefore, we need to adjust `l` to be the new value plus 1, while `k` remains greater than this new value of `l`.

State: **`i` is the new value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `arr[l]`, `k` is greater than the new value of `l` plus 1**
