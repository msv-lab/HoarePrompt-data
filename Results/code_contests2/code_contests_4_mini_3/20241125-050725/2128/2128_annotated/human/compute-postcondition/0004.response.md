The code assigns a new value to `arr` by sorting it in reverse order. The variable `arr` is affected, and its previous values were integers from input. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order**
