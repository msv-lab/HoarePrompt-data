The variable `ans` is assigned the value of the first element of the `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` will hold the largest value of the array. The previous values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is the new value (previous `i` + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, and `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr`.

Output State: **`i` is the new value (previous `i` + 1), `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is equal to the largest value in `arr`**
