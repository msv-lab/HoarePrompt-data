Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with `ans` being the largest integer from `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`, ensuring that `k` remains within bounds. If `k` is already less than `n`, its value remains unchanged.***
