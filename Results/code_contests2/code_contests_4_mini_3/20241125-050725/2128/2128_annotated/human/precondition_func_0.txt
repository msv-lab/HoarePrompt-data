t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); n is an integer (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5); k is an integer (1 ≤ k < n); and a_i is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial amount of water in each of the n barrels, where the total number of barrels across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
