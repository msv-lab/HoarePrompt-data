To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description:
- We need to check if string S can equal string T after performing a rotation operation.
- The rotation operation moves the last character of the string to the front.

### Program Analysis:
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two strings, `s` and `t`.
2. **Rotation Check**: The program checks if `s` can be obtained by any rotation of `t`. It does this by:
   - Generating all possible rotations of `t` using slicing (`t[i:] + t[:i]` for every index `i` from `0` to `len(t) - 1`).
   - It checks if any of these rotations equal `s` using the `any()` function.
3. **Output**: It prints 'Yes' if any rotation matches `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Length Constraint**: The program assumes that `|S| = |T|` as per the problem constraints, so length mismatch is not an issue.
- **Correctness of Rotation Logic**: The logic of checking all rotations of `t` is correct. For each `i`, `t[i:] + t[:i]` represents the string `t` rotated to the left by `i` positions.
- **Output Format**: The program correctly maps the boolean result of the `any()` function to the required output format ('Yes' or 'No').

### Edge Cases:
- Given that the program handles any rotation correctly and all strings consist of lowercase letters, there don't appear to be any edge cases overlooked in the logic.

### Conclusion:
Since the program accurately checks for all potential rotations of `t` against `s` and outputs the correct result based on the problem description, I cannot identify any input or potential case where the program does not perform as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
