Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings `s` and `t` (both read from user input) and checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`. If `s` is a rotation of `t`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". The function does not explicitly handle cases where the lengths of `s` and `t` differ, which could lead to incorrect results if the input strings do not meet the expected conditions.**
