The value of `t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string of lowercase English letters. The previous states of the variables `S` and `T` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged strings and the new assignment.

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with equal lengths; `t` is an input string of lowercase English letters**
