To determine the correctness of the provided code, we need to analyze both the code itself and the annotations to see if it meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to check if string `S` can be obtained from string `T` through a series of rotations. A rotation involves moving characters from the front of the string to the end. For example, for the string "abc", valid rotations include "abc", "bca", and "cab".

### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    s = raw_input()
    t = raw_input()
    print['No', 'Yes'][any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))]
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code uses `raw_input()` which is appropriate for Python 2.x but not applicable for Python 3.x (it should be replaced with `input()`).

2. **Rotation Logic**:
   - The expression `t[i:] + t[:i]` generates all possible rotations of string `T` by iterating over its length (`len(t)`).
   - `any(...)` checks if any of these rotations matches `S`.
   - If a match is found, it evaluates to `True`, and the index in the list `['No', 'Yes']` will be `1`, thus printing "Yes". If no match is found, it evaluates to `False`, printing "No".

3. **Output**:
   - The output is a direct match with the requirement to print "Yes" if `S` can be obtained by rotating `T`, and "No" otherwise.

### Examining Edge Cases:
- Given the constraints (strings of equal length and only lowercase letters), the program seems to handle all valid inputs as expected.
- The program checks all rotations, thus it should correctly identify if `S` can be obtained from `T` for any valid input.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic, the code correctly checks for all possible rotations of `T` to see if it equals `S`. The annotations are consistent with the functionality of the code. Therefore, I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to perform as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
