To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the intended functionality.

The problem requires us to check if string `S` can be made equal to string `T` through a series of rotations. A rotation means moving the last character of the string to the front.

The code provided is as follows:

```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The code takes two strings `s` and `t` as input.
2. **Rotation Logic**: The core logic checks if any rotation of string `t` matches string `s`. It does this by:
   - Iterating through every possible rotation of `t` using slicing.
   - Comparing each rotated version of `t` with `s`.
3. **Output**: The code prints 'Yes' if any rotation matches `s` and 'No' otherwise.

### Test Cases:
1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `kyoto`, `tokyo`
   - Output: `Yes` (correct, as `kyoto` can become `tokyo` through rotation).
   
2. **Example 2**: 
   - Input: `abc`, `arc`
   - Output: `No` (correct, as `abc` cannot be rotated to become `arc`).
   
3. **Example 3**: 
   - Input: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab`, `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab`
   - Output: `Yes` (correct, as both strings are identical).

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider additional potential edge cases:
1. Input where `S` and `T` are identical but have different characters in rotation:
   - Input: `ab`, `ba`
   - Output should be `Yes` (correct).
   
2. Input where `S` is a single rotation away from `T`:
   - Input: `abcde`, `deabc`
   - Output should be `Yes` (correct).
   
3. Input where `S` has the same characters but in a different order:
   - Input: `abab`, `baba`
   - Output should be `Yes` (correct, as it can be rotated).
   
4. Input where `S` and `T` are both of length 2 but different:
   - Input: `ab`, `cd`
   - Output should be `No` (correct, as they cannot be made equal by rotation).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified cases and adheres to the problem description. It checks every possible rotation of `T` and determines if it matches `S`. Therefore, I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
