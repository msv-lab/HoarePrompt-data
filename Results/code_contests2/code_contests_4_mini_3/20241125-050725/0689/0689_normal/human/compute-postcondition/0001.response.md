The variable `t` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which captures an input string from the user. The previous values of `S` and `T` remain unchanged, and the value of `s` is also unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and both strings have the same length between 2 and 100 characters; `s` is assigned the input string; `t` is the input string from `raw_input()`. 

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and both strings have the same length between 2 and 100 characters; `s` is assigned the input string; `t` is the input string from `raw_input()`**.
