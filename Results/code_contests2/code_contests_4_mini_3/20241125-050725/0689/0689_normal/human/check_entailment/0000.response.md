To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze the code in relation to the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if string `S` equals string `T` after any number of rotations. A rotation is defined as moving the last character of the string to the front.

### Program Code:
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

### Output Hints:
The function checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`. It prints 'Yes' if `s` can be formed by any rotation of `t`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not take any parameters explicitly, which may limit usability and testing.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code reads two strings, `s` and `t`, from user input.
2. It uses a list indexing to print 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition that checks if any rotation of `t` equals `s`.
3. The rotation is implemented by slicing `t` at index `i` and concatenating the two parts.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Identical Strings**: If `s` and `t` are identical, the output should be 'Yes'. This is handled correctly by the code.
2. **Different Length Strings**: The problem constraints ensure both strings are of equal length, so this case is not applicable.
3. **All Characters Same**: For example, both strings being "aaaa". The code should return 'Yes', and it does.
4. **Non-rotatable Cases**: If `s = "abc"` and `t = "cba"`, the output should be 'No', and the code checks this through all rotations of `t`.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function checks if `s` can be formed by any rotation of `t`. This aligns with the logic in the code, which checks each possible rotation generated by the slicing technique.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code and the provided output hints, the logic appears to cover all potential cases as defined in the problem description. The tests based on the examples provided in the problem description are also satisfied by the code.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly determines if `S` can be obtained from `T` through rotations for all specified cases.
