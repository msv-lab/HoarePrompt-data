The function accepts two strings `s` and `t` (both read from user input) and checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`. It prints 'Yes' if `s` can be formed by any rotation of `t`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not take any parameters explicitly, as it uses input directly from the user, which may lead to limitations in usability and testing.
