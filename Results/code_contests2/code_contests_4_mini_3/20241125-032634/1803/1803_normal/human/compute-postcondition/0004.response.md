The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since the initial value of `k` is 1, after execution, `k` becomes 4. The values of `Cadena` and `Arreglo` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string formatted as a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly brackets, `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena`, and `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string formatted as a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly brackets, `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena`, and `k` is 4**
