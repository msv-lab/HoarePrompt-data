Output State: **If `Cadena` has at least 2 characters, `Arreglo` will contain the characters at indices 1, 4, 7, ..., up to the last valid index that is less than the length of `Cadena`. `k` will be the next index that exceeds the length of `Cadena`. If `Cadena` has less than 2 characters, the loop does not execute, and `Arreglo` remains empty with `k` equal to 1.**
