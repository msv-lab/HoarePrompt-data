According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions involving the variable `Cadena`. The loop will continue executing as long as the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` (which is 10) and greater than 2. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `Cadena` must have a length greater than 7. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `Cadena` must be greater than 10 (to satisfy `len(Cadena) > k`) and still greater than 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the condition on the length of `Cadena` to ensure it is greater than 10.

State: **`Cadena` must have a length greater than 10; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 7 of `Cadena`; `k` is 10**
