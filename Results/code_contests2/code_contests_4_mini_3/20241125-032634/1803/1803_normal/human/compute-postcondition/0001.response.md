The variable `Arreglo` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The value of `Cadena` remains unchanged, as this code only affects the variable `Arreglo`. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is a string formatted as a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with each letter separated by a comma and a space, and can be empty; `Arreglo` is an empty list.
