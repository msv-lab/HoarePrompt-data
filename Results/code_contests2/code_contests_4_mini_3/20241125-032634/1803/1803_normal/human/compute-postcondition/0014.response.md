The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes a string formatted as a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with each letter separated by a comma and a space. The string can have a maximum length of 1000 characters and is guaranteed to start with an opening curly bracket and end with a closing curly bracket. The set can also be empty. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a string representation of a set of lowercase English letters while adhering to specific formatting constraints.
