The value of `k` is incremented by 3, so the new value of `k` becomes 4 + 3 = 7. The states of the other variables `Cadena` and `Arreglo` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` must have a length greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena`; `k` is 7.

Output State: **`Cadena` must have a length greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena`; `k` is 7**
