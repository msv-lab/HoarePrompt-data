To analyze the provided code snippet, we must consider the initial values of the variables and how the code affects them.

- `Cadena` is a string formatted as a set of lowercase English letters in curly brackets, such as `"{a, b, c}"`, or it can be empty. 
- `Arreglo` is an empty list to start with.
- `k` is set to 1.

The line of code `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` attempts to access the character at index `k` of the string `Cadena`. 

1. If `Cadena` is non-empty, `Cadena[k]` will retrieve the character at index 1 of `Cadena`. 
2. The character retrieved will be placed in a new list and concatenated to `Arreglo`.

However, if `Cadena` is empty or if `k` exceeds the length of `Cadena`, this will lead to an IndexError. 

To provide an output state:
- If `Cadena` is non-empty and has at least 2 characters, `Arreglo` will now contain the character at index 1 of `Cadena`.
- If `Cadena` is either empty or has less than 2 characters, the operation cannot be completed, leading to an exception.

Thus, the output state depends on the specific content of `Cadena`. However, since we are instructed to provide an output state without giving possible exceptions, we can summarize as:

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string formatted as a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly brackets, `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena`, and `k` is 1**.
