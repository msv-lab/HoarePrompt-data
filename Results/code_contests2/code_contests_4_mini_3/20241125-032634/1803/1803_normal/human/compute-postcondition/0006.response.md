The code modifies the `Arreglo` list by appending the element at index `k` of `Cadena`. Given that `k` is 4, the code accesses `Cadena[4]`. Since `Cadena` must have a length greater than 4, we can safely assume that `Cadena[4]` exists and is a valid character. The `Arreglo` list is updated to include this character.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `Arreglo` after the addition of `Cadena[k]`:

Output State: **`Cadena` must have a length greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena`; `k` is 4**
