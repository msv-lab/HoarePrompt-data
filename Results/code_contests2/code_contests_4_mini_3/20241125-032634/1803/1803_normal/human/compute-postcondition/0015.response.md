The function `func` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user for input through `raw_input()`, expecting a string. It initializes an empty list `Arreglo` and a counter `k` starting at 1. The function then enters a loop that continues while the length of the input string `Cadena` is greater than `k` and the length of `Cadena` is greater than 2. Inside the loop, it appends every third character from `Cadena` starting from index 1 to the list `Arreglo`. 

After the loop execution, the function prints the count of unique characters in `Arreglo` by converting it to a set and measuring its length. However, if the input string is less than 2 characters long, the loop does not execute, and `Arreglo` remains empty. 

The function does not perform any error handling for non-string inputs or invalid string formats, which may lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, it relies on the assumption that the user will enter a valid string without any specific formatting or character checks.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for a string input, extracts every third character from the string starting at the second character, and prints the count of unique characters extracted. If the input string has fewer than 2 characters, it prints 0. **
