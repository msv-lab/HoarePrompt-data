The value of `k` is incremented by 3, changing its value from 7 to 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` must have a length greater than 7; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 7 of `Cadena`; `k` is 10.

Output State: **`Cadena` must have a length greater than 7; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 7 of `Cadena`; `k` is 10**
