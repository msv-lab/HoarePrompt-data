The variable `Arreglo` is updated by adding the character at index `k` of `Cadena` to it. Since `k` is 7, `Arreglo` will include the character at index 7 of `Cadena`. The current state of `Cadena` is not specified, but it must be a string with a length greater than 7, allowing access to index 7. 

The new state of `Arreglo` will be its previous value plus the character from `Cadena` at index 7. The impact on other variables is not recorded, so they remain unaffected.

Output State: **`Cadena` must have a length greater than 7; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena`, plus the character at index 7 of `Cadena`; `k` is 7.**
