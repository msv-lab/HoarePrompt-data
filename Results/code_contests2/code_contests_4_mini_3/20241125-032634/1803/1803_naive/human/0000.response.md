To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code based on the problem description.

The problem requires counting the number of distinct letters in a string formatted as a set enclosed in curly braces and separated by commas and spaces.

The provided program is:
```python
Cadena = raw_input()
Arreglo = []
k = 1
while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
    Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
    k = k + 3
print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is appropriate in Python 2 but doesn't work in Python 3. Assuming the environment uses Python 2, this part is valid.

2. **Extracting Letters**: The program initializes `k` at 1 and uses a while loop to iterate through `Cadena`. It attempts to extract letters by incrementing `k` by 3 each time (to skip the comma and space after each letter). 
   - The `Arreglo` will receive the letters at indices 1, 4, 7, ... (which correspond to the first letter, the fourth letter, the seventh letter, etc.) under the assumption that the format is always `{letter1, letter2, letter3,...}`.

3. **Distinct Count**: The program finally converts `Arreglo` to a set (to remove duplicates) and counts the length. 

### Potential Issue:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where there may be no letters (i.e., the input is `{}`), as the `while` condition will not allow it to enter the loop, and `Arreglo` will remain empty. However, in this case, `len(list(set(Arreglo)))` will correctly return `0`, which is expected.

- The main issue arises when the input has spaces after the commas, as the program's index incrementing by 3 does not account for the letter's position correctly after the first letter if there are more letters. For example:
  - Input: `{a, b, c}` 
    - The extraction will only get `a` and skip the others (it will not reach `b` and `c`).

4. **Incorrect Extraction Logic**: The index logic of `k` being incremented by 3 leads to incorrect extraction of letters because it does not consider the actual structure of the input and assumes fixed positions based on a specific number of letters.

### Conclusion:
Given the issue where multiple letters are not being extracted correctly due to the way indices are managed, the program does not correctly fulfill the problem requirements.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
