The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Previously, `k` was 4, so after the execution, `k` becomes 7. The states of the other variables (`Cadena` and `Arreglo`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}" with len(`Cadena`) greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` and the fifth character of `Cadena`; `k` is 7.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}" with len(`Cadena`) greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` and the fifth character of `Cadena`; `k` is 7**
