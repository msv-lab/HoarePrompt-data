The variable `k` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `Cadena` and `Arreglo` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is an empty list; `k` is 1.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is an empty list; `k` is 1**
