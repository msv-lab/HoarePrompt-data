The code assigns a new value to `Arreglo` by concatenating it with a list containing the element at index `k` of `Cadena`. Given that `k` is 1, the element being accessed is `Cadena[1]`. Since `Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}", `Cadena[1]` corresponds to the second letter in the input string.

Assuming `Cadena` has a valid format, we can determine that the value of `Arreglo` will now include the letter at index 1 of `Cadena`. The initial state of `Arreglo` is an empty list, so after the operation, `Arreglo` will have one element.

The output state will reflect the changes to `Arreglo` and will indicate that it now contains the letter at index 1 of `Cadena`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing `Cadena[1]`; `k` is 1**
