The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is 7, so after execution, `k` becomes 10. The states of the other variables (`Cadena` and `Arreglo`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, the fifth character of `Cadena`, and `Cadena[7]`, and `k` is now 10.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, the fifth character of `Cadena`, and `Cadena[7]`, and `k` is now 10**
