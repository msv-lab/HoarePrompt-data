The code updates `Arreglo` by appending the character from `Cadena` at index `k`, which is 7. The state of `Cadena` is given to be a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}" and has a length greater than 7, ensuring that `Cadena[7]` is a valid index. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `Arreglo`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, the fifth character of `Cadena`, and `Cadena[7]`, `k` is 7**
