The value of `Arreglo` is updated by appending `Cadena[k]` to it. Since `k` is 4, `Cadena[k]` refers to the fifth character in the string `Cadena`. The previous value of `Arreglo` was `Cadena[1]`, which is the second character of `Cadena`. Therefore, after execution, `Arreglo` will now contain the second character of `Cadena` followed by the fifth character of `Cadena`. The state of `Cadena` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}" with len(Cadena) greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` and the fifth character of `Cadena`; `k` is 4**
