The value of `Cadena` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}". Since the specific input is not provided, I cannot determine the exact value of `Cadena`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the assignment of the input string to `Cadena`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}"**
