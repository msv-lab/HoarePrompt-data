According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `len(Cadena)`. For the loop to execute again, `len(Cadena)` must be greater than `k` (which is 7) and also greater than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4, but it needs to be more than 7 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `len(Cadena)` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 7.

No other states need to be adjusted since `Arreglo` and `k` do not directly affect the loop condition.

State: **`Cadena` is a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}" with len(`Cadena`) greater than 7; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` and the fifth character of `Cadena`; `k` is 7**
