The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it relies on user input through the `raw_input()` function. It reads a string called `Cadena` and initializes an empty list `Arreglo`. The function then iterates through the string, starting from the second character (index 1), and every third character thereafter, appending these characters to `Arreglo`. If the length of `Cadena` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and `Arreglo` remains an empty list. After the loop, the function prints the length of the set of unique characters in `Arreglo`. 

However, the annotations suggest that the function returns a collection of lowercase English letters contained within the string, which is inaccurate. The function does not return anything; it only prints the length of the unique characters collected.

Additionally, the function does not specifically filter for lowercase English letters, so it will include any characters from the input string, which might not be lowercase letters.

Functionality: ** The function reads a string input, extracts every third character starting from the second character, and prints the count of unique characters from that extraction. It does not filter for lowercase English letters and does not return any value. **
