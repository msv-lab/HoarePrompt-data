`k` is incremented by 3, and its previous value is 1, so after execution, `k` becomes 4. The states of the other variables, `Cadena` and `Arreglo`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing `Cadena[1]`; `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is a list containing `Cadena[1]`; `k` is 4**
