Output State: **If the length of `Cadena` is greater than 2, then `Arreglo` contains every third character starting from the second character of `Cadena` until `k` exceeds the length of `Cadena`. If the length of `Cadena` is 2 or less, the loop does not execute and `Arreglo` remains an empty list. The final value of `k` will be the first value that exceeds the length of `Cadena`, which is greater than or equal to `len(Cadena)`.**
