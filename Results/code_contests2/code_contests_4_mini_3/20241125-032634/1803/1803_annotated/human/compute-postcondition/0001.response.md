`Arreglo` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `Cadena` remains unchanged as it is just a string input. Other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is an empty list.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string in the format "{letter1, letter2, ...}"; `Arreglo` is an empty list**
