Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000; `P` is a list of length N + 1 initialized with zeros; `i` is an integer such that i > 0; the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i` is 'AC'; `P[0]` is 0.***
