Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N`, where `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0, then `P[0]` is set to 0. If `i` is not 0, the program continues without modifying `P[0]`. The value of `i` is equal to `N`, which means this condition will not be true during this execution as `i` cannot be 0. Thus, `P[0]` remains unchanged.***
