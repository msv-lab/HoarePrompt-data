Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000; `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized with zeros; if `i > 0` and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1]`. In the case where `i` is 0, `P[0]` remains 0 and no changes are made to `P[i]`.***
