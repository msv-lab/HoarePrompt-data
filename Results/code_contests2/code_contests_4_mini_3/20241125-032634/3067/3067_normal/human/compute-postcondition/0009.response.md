The variable `P[i]` is assigned the value `P[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `P` is initialized with zeros and `P[0]` is 0, the value of `P[i - 1]` is also 0. Therefore, `P[i]` becomes `0 + 1`, which is 1.

The other variables (`S`, `N`, `Q`, `P`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000, `P` is a list of length N + 1 initialized with zeros, `i` is an integer such that i > 0, the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i` is 'AC', `P[i]` is 1**
