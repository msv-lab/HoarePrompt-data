Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000; `P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[0]` is set to 0. If `i` is greater than 0 and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is 'AC', then `P[i]` is updated to `P[i - 1] + 1`. If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is not 'AC', then `P[i]` retains the value of `P[i - 1]`. This ensures that `P` counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' up to index `i` while maintaining the value at `P[0]` as 0.***
