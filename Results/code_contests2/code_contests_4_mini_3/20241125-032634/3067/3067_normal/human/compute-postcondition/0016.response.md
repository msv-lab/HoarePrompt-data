Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000; `P` is a list of length `N + 1`. If `i` equals 0, `P[0]` is set to 0, and the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop is skipped. If `i` is greater than 0, the program continues with the existing values of `P` without modification to `P[0]`.***
