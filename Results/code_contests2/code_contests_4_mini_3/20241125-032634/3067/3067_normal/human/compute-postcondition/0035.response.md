According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `Q`. If `Q` is greater than the current iteration count, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` is greater than 1, which means there is still at least one more iteration left to execute. Therefore, `Q` should be adjusted to be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, since the loop uses an underscore `_` to indicate that the specific iteration count is not being used, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than 2, `l` and `r` are assigned integer values based on user input, and the output is `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`**
