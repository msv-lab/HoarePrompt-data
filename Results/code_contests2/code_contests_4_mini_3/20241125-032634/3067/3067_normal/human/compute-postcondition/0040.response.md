The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`, which is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The parameter `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, and `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. The function processes these queries and returns the results based on the specified conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and processes Q queries defined by pairs of integers (l_i, r_i), returning results based on the character counts or conditions applied to the substrings of S.**
