Output State: **`P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[0]` is 0; `Q` is the number of queries; `l` and `r` are assigned integer values from user input for each query; the output for each query is the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. If `Q` is 0, the loop does not execute and no output is generated. If `l` or `r` are out of bounds (less than 1 or greater than `N`), it may lead to an index error. The values of `P` remain unchanged in those cases.**
