Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N`, where `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000, and `P[0]` remains unchanged. If the last two characters of `S` are 'AC', then `P[N]` is updated to `P[N - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `P[N]` is assigned the value of `P[N - 1]`.***
