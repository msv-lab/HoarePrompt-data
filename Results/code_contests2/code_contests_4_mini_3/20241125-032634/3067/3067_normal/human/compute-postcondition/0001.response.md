The variable `S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The initial state indicates that `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `S` and retains the existing values of `N` and `Q`.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000; `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= `Q` <= 100000**
