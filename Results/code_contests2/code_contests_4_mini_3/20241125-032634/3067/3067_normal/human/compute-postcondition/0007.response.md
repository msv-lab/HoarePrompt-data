Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000; `P` is a list of length N + 1 initialized with zeros; `i` is 0, then `P[0]` is set to 0. If `i` is not equal to 0, the program continues without modifying `P[0]`.***
