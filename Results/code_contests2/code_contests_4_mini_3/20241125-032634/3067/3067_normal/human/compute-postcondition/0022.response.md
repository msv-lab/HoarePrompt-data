The statement `continue` does not change any variable values or states, but it indicates that the execution will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration if there is one. Since we don't have any information about a loop context here, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N`, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` set to 0, and `i` is N.**
