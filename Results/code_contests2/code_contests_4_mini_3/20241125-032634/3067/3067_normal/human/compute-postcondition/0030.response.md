The values of `l` and `r` are assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means `raw_input()` will accept a space-separated input and `map(int, ...)` will convert those inputs into integers. The current state of `P` and `Q` is not affected, only the new variables `l` and `r` are introduced. Since the specifics of the input are not given, `l` and `r` will hold the integer values that are inputted. 

The output state is: `P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than 0, and `l` and `r` are assigned integer values based on user input.

Output State: **`P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than 0, and `l` and `r` are assigned integer values based on user input.**
