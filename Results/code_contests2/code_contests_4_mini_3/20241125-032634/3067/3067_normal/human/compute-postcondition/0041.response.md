Functionality: ** The function reads an integer N and a string S of length N, counting the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in S. It then processes Q queries where each query specifies a range (l, r) and returns the number of 'AC' substrings found between indices l and r (1-indexed). If Q is 0, no output is generated. The function does not handle cases where l or r are out of bounds, which may result in an index error. **
