The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, we cannot determine any changes to the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000; `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` is 0, and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
