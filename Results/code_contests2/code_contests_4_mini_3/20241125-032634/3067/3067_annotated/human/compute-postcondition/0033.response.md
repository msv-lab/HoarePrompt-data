The code assigns values to `l` and `r` from the input, using `map(int, raw_input().split())` to convert the split input strings into integers. The previous values of `l` and `r` are unknown as they come from user input. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `P` is a list initialized to zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the output is 0.

Output State: **`P` is a list initialized to zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the output is 0**
