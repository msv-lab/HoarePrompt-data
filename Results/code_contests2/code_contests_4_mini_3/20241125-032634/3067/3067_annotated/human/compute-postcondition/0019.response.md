Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0. If `S[0:2]` equals 'AC', then `P[1]` is set to `P[0] + 1`, which will be 1. Otherwise, `P[1]` remains equal to `P[0]`, which is 0. Thus, after the execution, `P[1]` will be either 1 (if `S[0:2]` is 'AC') or 0 (if it is not).***
