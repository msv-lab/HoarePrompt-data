The code assigns values to `l` and `r` by mapping the output of `raw_input()` split by space to integers. The previous values of `P` and `Q` are not affected by this operation. Since `raw_input()` accepts input from the user, `l` and `r` will be assigned the integer values entered by the user. Therefore, the output state reflects that `l` and `r` are now assigned input integers, while `P` remains a list initialized to zeros and `Q` retains its value.

Output State: **`P` is a list initialized to zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
