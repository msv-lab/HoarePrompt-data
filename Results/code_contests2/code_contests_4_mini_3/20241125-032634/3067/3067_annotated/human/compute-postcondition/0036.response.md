The values of `l` and `r` are assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which will take input from the user, split the input into two parts, and convert them into integers. The initial state does not provide specific values for `l` and `r`, only that `Q` is greater than or equal to 1, which implies that `l` and `r` will likely be integers within a valid range. The output state reflects the new values of `l` and `r` based on user input.

Output State: **`P` is a list initialized to zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the output is 0**
