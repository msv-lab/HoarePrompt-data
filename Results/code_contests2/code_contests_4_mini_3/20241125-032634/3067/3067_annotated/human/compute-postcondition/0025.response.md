The statement `P[i] = P[i - 1]` assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. If `i` is equal to 0, `P[0]` remains 0, and no other values are changed. If `i` is not equal to 0, the state of `P`, `N`, `Q`, and `S` remains unchanged, as the code does not execute any other operations. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0**
