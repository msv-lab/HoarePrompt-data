Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0. If `i` is equal to 0, `P[0]` remains 0, and the program continues without any changes to other values. If `i` is not equal to 0, the state of `P`, `N`, `Q`, and `S` is unchanged since the code does not execute any other operations.***
