Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with 0s, and `i` is 0. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `P[i]` remains equal to `P[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 0, we need to ensure that `P[0]` is initialized to 0, leading to the condition that `P[0] = 0` regardless of whether the condition for 'AC' is met or not. This means `P[0]` is 0, and `P[i]` either increments by 1 or remains 0 based on the evaluation of the substring.***
