According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `i` from 0 up to `N-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to 0, which means the loop has just started but has not yet executed again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Therefore, `i` will be set to 1 for the next iteration. 

The values of `N`, `Q`, `S`, and `P` remain unchanged as stated in the task. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0, `i` is 1**
