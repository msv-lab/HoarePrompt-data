Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then `P[0]` remains 0. If `i` is greater than 0 and `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`; otherwise, if `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is not 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1]`. In all cases, the values of `N`, `Q`, and `S` remain unchanged.***
