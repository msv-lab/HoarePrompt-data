The code prints the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. The list `P` is initialized to zeros, which means every element in `P` is 0. Therefore, `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` will both be 0. 

The output of the expression `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` will be `0 - 0`, which is 0. The other variables `Q`, `l`, and `r` do not affect the output state since they are not modified here.

The output state is: `P` is a list initialized to zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the output is 0.

Output State: **`P` is a list initialized to zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the output is 0**.
