The statement `P[i] = P[i - 1]` assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Since `i` is initialized to 1, this means `P[1]` will be assigned the value of `P[0]`. Given that `P[0]` is 0 (as per the initial state), after execution, `P[1]` will also be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 0, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 0, `i` is 1**
