The code assigns the values obtained from `raw_input()` split into two integers to `N` and `Q`. The values of `N` and `Q` are determined based on the input provided, which adheres to the constraints that `N` is between 2 and 100,000, and `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. The other variables `S`, `l_i`, and `r_i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is based only on the assignment of `N` and `Q`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000**
