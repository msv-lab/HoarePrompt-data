The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, reflecting the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0, and `i` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
