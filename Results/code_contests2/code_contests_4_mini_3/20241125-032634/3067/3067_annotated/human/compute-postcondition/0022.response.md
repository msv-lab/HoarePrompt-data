The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. However, since we do not have any loop context provided, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0, and `P[0]` remains 0.
