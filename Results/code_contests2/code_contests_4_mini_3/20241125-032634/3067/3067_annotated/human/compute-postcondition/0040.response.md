The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on the following constraints: `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000; and for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. 

The function processes a series of queries on the string `S` and returns results based on these queries. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle a string `S` of specified constraints and answer a number of queries regarding substrings of `S` defined by the indices `l_i` and `r_i`. The exact output for each query is not specified in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function processes a string S of length N, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and answers Q queries regarding substrings defined by pairs of indices (l_i, r_i).**
