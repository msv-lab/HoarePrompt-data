The variable `S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which captures user input as a string. The initial values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged, as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `S` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and `S` is an input string**.
