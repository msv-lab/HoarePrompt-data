Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` with `P[0]` as 0, and `i` is 1. If `i` equals 0, `P[0]` remains 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to `P[0]`. Since `i` is initialized to 1, the condition `i == 0` will not be met, and thus, the execution does not modify `P[0]` or change the flow of the program.***
