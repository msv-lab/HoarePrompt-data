Initial State: `P` is a list initialized to zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the output is 0

```
print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])
```

Now, please think step by step: The expression `P[r - 1]` references the element at index `r - 1` in the list `P`, and `P[l - 1]` references the element at index `l - 1`. Since `P` is initialized to zeros, both `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` will yield 0, assuming `r` and `l` are within bounds. Thus, the calculation is `0 - 0`, which results in 0. The output state reflects that the print statement outputs 0.

Output State: **`P` is a list initialized to zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the output is 0**
