The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, which means that `P[i]` refers to `P[0]`. Since `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with 0s, `P[0]` is 0. Therefore, `P[0]` remains 0 after the assignment. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with 0s, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is 0**.
