Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `Q` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with 0s, and `i` is 0. If `i` is equal to 0, `P[0]` is set to 0, and the program continues to the next iteration or block in the loop.***
