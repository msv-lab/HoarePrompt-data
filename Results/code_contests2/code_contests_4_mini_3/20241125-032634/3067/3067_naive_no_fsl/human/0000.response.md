Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly processes the queries to count the occurrences of the substring "AC" in the specified ranges of the input string S. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It first reads the input values for N (length of string S) and Q (number of queries).
2. The string S is read next, and an array P is initialized to keep a cumulative count of "AC" occurrences up to each index.
3. The program iterates through the string S, checking for the substring "AC" at each position. If it finds "AC" at positions `i-1` and `i`, it increments the count in P at index `i`.
4. For each query, it computes the number of occurrences of "AC" between indices `l` and `r` using the difference `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`, which accurately gives the count of "AC" in the specified range.

The algorithm effectively handles the constraints provided, and the logic correctly accounts for the inclusive nature of the query bounds. Given the structure of the program and the correctness of its logic, no edge cases or failures can be identified. Thus, the implementation meets the problem requirements and will work for all valid inputs as specified.
