To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic and see if it correctly generates a Pythagorean triple for any integer input \( n \) as described in the problem.

### Code Analysis:
The program processes the input integer \( n \) and checks:

1. If \( n \) is less than or equal to 2, it outputs `-1`. This is correct, as there are no Pythagorean triples with the smallest side being 1 or 2.
   
2. If \( n \) is odd:
   - It calculates \( m \) and \( k \) using the formulas:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   - These formulas are derived from the property of Pythagorean triples, where if \( n \) is an odd integer, \( m \) and \( k \) will yield a valid triple.

3. If \( n \) is even:
   - It calculates \( m \) and \( k \) using the formulas:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)
   - These formulas also result in a valid Pythagorean triple when \( n \) is even.

### Potential Issues:
- The program uses integer division where necessary, but due to the way the output is formatted (using parentheses) and the absence of explicit print statements for \( m \) and \( k \), it seems that the output may not work as intended. 

### Example Cases:
Letâ€™s check a few example inputs to see if the output is as expected:

1. For \( n = 3 \):
   - \( m = (3^2 - 1) / 2 = 4 \)
   - \( k = (3^2 + 1) / 2 = 5 \)
   - Output: `4 5` (Correct)

2. For \( n = 6 \):
   - \( m = (6^2 / 4) - 1 = 8 \)
   - \( k = (6^2 / 4) + 1 = 10 \)
   - Output: `8 10` (Correct)

3. For \( n = 1 \):
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. For \( n = 17 \):
   - \( m = (17^2 - 1) / 2 = 144 \)
   - \( k = (17^2 + 1) / 2 = 145 \)
   - Output: `144 145` (Correct)

5. For \( n = 67 \):
   - \( m = (67^2 - 1) / 2 = 2244 \)
   - \( k = (67^2 + 1) / 2 = 2245 \)
   - Output: `2244 2245` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program appears to implement the logic correctly for all tested cases. However, there is a significant issue: the output statements are incorrectly formatted (using parentheses instead of separate print statements). This will cause a runtime error or an unexpected output format, as it does not actually print \( m \) and \( k \) correctly.

Since the program has a logical flaw in how it formats its output, it does not fulfill the requirement to output two integers correctly in every case.

Correctness: **False**
