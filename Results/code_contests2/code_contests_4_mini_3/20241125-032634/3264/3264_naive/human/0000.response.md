The provided program attempts to find a Pythagorean triple given an integer `n`, which can be a leg (cathetus) or the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Let's analyze the code to see if it correctly handles all potential cases:

### Code Analysis
```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print - 1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it immediately prints `-1`, which is correct since no Pythagorean triple can exist for `n = 1` or `n = 2`.

2. **Odd `n` Case**: 
   - For odd values of `n`, the program computes:
     ```python
     (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
     ```
   - This expression calculates the other two sides of the triangle. However, the syntax is incorrect. The parentheses around the `print` statement are not necessary and cause a syntax error. Instead, it should just print the values directly:
     ```python
     print((n * n - 1) // 2, (n * n + 1) // 2)
     ```
   - Furthermore, using integer division (`//`) is essential to ensure the values are integers.

3. **Even `n` Case**: 
   - For even values of `n`, the program calculates:
     ```python
     (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
     ```
   - Similar to the odd case, this will also cause a syntax error and should be corrected to:
     ```python
     print((n * n // 4 - 1), (n * n // 4 + 1))
     ```

### Potential Cases
1. If `n = 1`, the output is `-1`, which is correct.
2. If `n = 2`, the output is also `-1`, which is correct.
3. For `n = 3`, the program should produce `4 5`, which is a valid Pythagorean triple. However, due to the syntax error, it will not execute correctly.
4. For `n = 4`, it should produce `3 5`, which is again valid. But due to the syntax error, it will not execute correctly.
5. The program fails to handle the case correctly due to the incorrect parentheses and division.

### Conclusion
Given the syntax errors in the program, it cannot correctly execute and will raise errors, leading to incorrect outputs for any valid input. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program has syntax errors that will prevent it from functioning correctly for any input. For example, for `n = 3`, instead of producing valid output, it will raise an error.
