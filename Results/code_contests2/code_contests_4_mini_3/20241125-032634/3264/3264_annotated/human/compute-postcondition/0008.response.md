Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9. If `n` is odd, the function prints the values \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) and \(\frac{n^2 + 1}{2}\), both of which are integers. If `n` is even, it prints the values \(\frac{n^2}{4} - 1\) and \(\frac{n^2}{4} + 1\), both of which are also integers.***
