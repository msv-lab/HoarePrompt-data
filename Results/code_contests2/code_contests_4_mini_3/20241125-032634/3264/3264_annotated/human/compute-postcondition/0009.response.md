Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 1 or 2, a syntax error occurs. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, the function prints the integers \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) and \(\frac{n^2 + 1}{2}\). If `n` is even and greater than 2, the function prints the integers \(\frac{n^2}{4} - 1\) and \(\frac{n^2}{4} + 1\). All printed values are guaranteed to be integers.***
