The code attempts to execute a print statement, but the syntax is incorrect due to the space between `print` and `-`. The program would raise a syntax error and not execute the print operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, and a syntax error occurs**.
