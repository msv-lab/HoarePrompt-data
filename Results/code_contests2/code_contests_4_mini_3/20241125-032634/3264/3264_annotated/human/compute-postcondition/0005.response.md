To determine the output state based on the initial conditions provided:

- `n` is a positive odd integer such that `n > 2` and `n <= 10^9`.

The code snippet calculates two expressions:
1. The first expression is `(n * n - 1) / 2`.
2. The second expression is `(n * n + 1) / 2`.

Since `n` is an odd integer, `n * n` will also be odd, and we can calculate the two expressions.

1. The first expression:
   - `n * n` is odd, thus `n * n - 1` is even.
   - The result of `(n * n - 1) / 2` will yield an integer.

2. The second expression:
   - `n * n + 1` is even, hence `(n * n + 1) / 2` will also yield an integer.

Both expressions return integer values based on the odd integer `n`. Therefore, we can represent the output state in a generalized form, given that `n` can take any odd integer value within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that `n` is greater than 2 and `n` is less than or equal to 10^9; the first expression is an integer, and the second expression is an integer.**
