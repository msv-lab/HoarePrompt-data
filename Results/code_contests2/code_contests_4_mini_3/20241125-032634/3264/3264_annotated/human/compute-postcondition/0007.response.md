To evaluate the impact of the code, we first note that `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^9\). 

The code performs the following operations:
1. It calculates \( \frac{n \times n}{4} - 1 \).
2. It calculates \( \frac{n \times n}{4} + 1 \).
3. It prints both results.

Since `n` is even, \( n \times n \) is also even, and therefore \( \frac{n \times n}{4} \) is an integer.

Let \( m = \frac{n \times n}{4} \).

The expressions simplify to:
- First expression: \( m - 1 \)
- Second expression: \( m + 1 \)

The output will therefore consist of two integer values:
- \( m - 1 \)
- \( m + 1 \)

Since the specific value of `n` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer such that `n` is greater than 2 and `n` is less than or equal to 10^9; the printed values are \( \frac{n \times n}{4} - 1 \) and \( \frac{n \times n}{4} + 1 \)**.
