Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is greater than 2, it checks if `n` is odd or even and prints two calculated integers based on the value of `n`: for odd `n`, it prints \((n^2 - 1) / 2\) and \((n^2 + 1) / 2\); for even `n`, it prints \((n^2 / 4) - 1\) and \((n^2 / 4) + 1\). All printed values are guaranteed to be integers. The function does not return any values. **
