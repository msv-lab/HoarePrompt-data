You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.

For example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.

Here Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.

Katya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?

Input

The only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109) — the length of some side of a right triangle.

Output

Print two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1018), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.

In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    if (n <= 2) :
        print - 1
    else :
        if (n & 1) :
            print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2
        else :
            print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9. If `n` is odd, the function prints the values \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) and \(\frac{n^2 + 1}{2}\), both of which are integers. If `n` is even, it prints the values \(\frac{n^2}{4} - 1\) and \(\frac{n^2}{4} + 1\), both of which are also integers.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 1 or 2, a syntax error occurs. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, the function prints the integers \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) and \(\frac{n^2 + 1}{2}\). If `n` is even and greater than 2, the function prints the integers \(\frac{n^2}{4} - 1\) and \(\frac{n^2}{4} + 1\). All printed values are guaranteed to be integers.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
