To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads a single integer `n` which represents the length of one side of a right triangle.

2. **Logic for Pythagorean Triples**:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the program outputs `-1` because it's impossible to form a Pythagorean triple with such small numbers.
   - If `n` is odd (and greater than 2), it calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   - If `n` is even (and greater than 2), it calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)
   - Finally, it prints `m` and `k`.

3. **Pythagorean Triple Validation**:
   - The generated triples must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - For odd `n`, the values produced are:
     - \( \left(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\right)^2 + n^2 = \left(\frac{n^2 + 1}{2}\right)^2 \)
   - For even `n`, the values produced are:
     - \( \left(\frac{n^2}{4} - 1\right)^2 + n^2 = \left(\frac{n^2}{4} + 1\right)^2 \)

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles `n = 1` and `n = 2` correctly by returning `-1`.
   - For all other values of `n`, it generates valid Pythagorean triples.

### Example Cases:
- For `n = 3`, it correctly outputs `4 5`.
- For `n = 6`, it correctly outputs `8 10`.
- For `n = 1`, it correctly outputs `-1`.
- For `n = 17`, it outputs `144 145`, which is a valid triple.
- For `n = 67`, it outputs `2244 2245`, which is also valid.

### Potential Issues:
The only issue could arise if the calculations for `m` and `k` don't yield integers or valid Pythagorean triples for certain inputs, which the code seems to handle correctly.

### Conclusion:
- There are no cases found where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Each condition and calculation aligns with the expected outputs for the defined range of `n`.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly identifies Pythagorean triples for all valid inputs according to the problem statement.
