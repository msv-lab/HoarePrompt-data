The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate on a positive integer `n` that is constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The output behavior of the function based on the input conditions is not explicitly provided, thus leaving the specific return value undefined. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate internally based on the positive integer `n`, which must meet the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a positive integer n constrained to 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
