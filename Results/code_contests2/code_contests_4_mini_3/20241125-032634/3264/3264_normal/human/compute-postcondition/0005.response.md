The expression calculates two values based on `n`. The first value is `(n * n - 1) / 2`, and the second value is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. Given that `n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and is odd, we can find specific values for these calculations.

Let's denote `n` as an odd integer greater than 2. The square of `n` is odd (since the square of an odd number is odd), thus both `n * n - 1` and `n * n + 1` will be even. Consequently, both results will yield integers when divided by 2.

Calculating the two expressions:
1. The first expression: `(n * n - 1) / 2`
2. The second expression: `(n * n + 1) / 2`

These calculations yield two integers.

Since `n` is an odd integer larger than 2, we cannot define specific values for the outputs without a specific value of `n`, but we can express the output state more generally. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and odd; the results are two integers based on the calculations `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`.**
