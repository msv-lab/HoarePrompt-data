Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the code attempts to print -1, but there is a syntax error that prevents it from executing correctly. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it prints the values of `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it prints the values of `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`.***
