The code snippet calculates two expressions using the variable `n`. 

1. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1`.
2. The second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and is even, the calculations can be performed directly.

Let's denote `n` as an even integer larger than 2. When we calculate:
- The first expression: `n * n / 4 - 1`
- The second expression: `n * n / 4 + 1`

Since `n` is even, `n * n` will also be even. Dividing by 4 results in an integer value. Therefore, both expressions will yield integer results.

The output state will reflect that the values of the expressions are calculated based on `n`, but we do not have a specific value for `n`, just its properties.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and an even number; the expressions yield two results: one is `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the other is `n * n / 4 + 1`.**
