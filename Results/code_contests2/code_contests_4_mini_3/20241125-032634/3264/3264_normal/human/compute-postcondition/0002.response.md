The code attempts to print `- 1`, which is a syntax error in Python. Since the code does not execute successfully, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, and `n` is less than or equal to 2, and there is a syntax error in the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and `n` is less than or equal to 2, and there is a syntax error in the code.**
