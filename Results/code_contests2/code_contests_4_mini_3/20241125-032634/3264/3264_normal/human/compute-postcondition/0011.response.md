Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` from user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it attempts to print -1, but due to a syntax error, this may not execute correctly. If `n` is greater than 2, it checks if `n` is odd or even and prints two calculated integers based on the formulas for both cases. For odd `n`, it prints `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. For even `n`, it prints `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. However, the function does not return any value, it only prints results to the console. The syntax error for the case when `n <= 2` means that the function may not behave as intended under that condition.**
