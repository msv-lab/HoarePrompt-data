To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code step-by-step.

The program aims to find a Pythagorean triple given one side of a right triangle (denoted as `n`), which can be either a cathetus (one of the two shorter sides) or the hypotenuse (the longest side).

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it attempts to print `-1`, implying that no Pythagorean triple can be formed.

2. **Odd and Even Cases**:
   - **Odd `n`**: The program calculates two numbers using the formulas:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   - **Even `n`**: The program calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated values for `m` and `k` if `n` is greater than 2.

### Analyzing Edge Cases
- For `n = 1`, the output is `-1`, which is correct because there are no Pythagorean triples that include 1.
- For `n = 2`, the program also outputs `-1`, which is correct because no Pythagorean triples exist for 2.
- For odd values (like `n = 3`), the program correctly computes `(4, 5)` as a Pythagorean triple.
- For even values (like `n = 4`), the program computes `(4, 5)` as well, which is valid.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Syntax Error**: The line `print(n * n - 1) / 2` is incorrectly formatted. This is a syntax error because the parentheses around `print` are misplaced. It should be:
   ```python
   print((n * n - 1) / 2)
   ```
   This means that the output for odd `n` will not be printed correctly, leading to incorrect behavior. 

2. **Integer Division**: The code uses normal division (`/`), which may lead to floating-point results. In Python 2, this is an issue since `print` should ideally output integers.

3. **Output for Valid Cases**: While the calculations seem correct, because of the syntax issues, the program will not produce any output for valid cases.

### Output Hints Review
The output hints describe the program's intention but do not match the actual implementation due to the syntax error. They indicate that the function should produce specific pairs of integers based on the value of `n`, but because of the misformatted print statements, it will fail to do so.

### Conclusion
The program has critical flaws that prevent it from functioning correctly, specifically the syntax error and improper handling of integer division. As a result, it does not meet the problem description's requirements for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
