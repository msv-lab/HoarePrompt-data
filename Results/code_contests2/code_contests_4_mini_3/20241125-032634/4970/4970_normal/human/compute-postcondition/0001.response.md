The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The constraints specify that `a` is a single integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15, but since `a` is not provided as a parameter in the function definition, it is not directly accepted by the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function does not involve any input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a defined output based on input values.**
