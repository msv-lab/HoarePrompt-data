To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program and the expected output for each possible input.

### Problem Description:
- Input: A single integer `a` where \(0 ≤ a ≤ 15\).
- Output: A single integer.

### Example Given:
- Input: `3`
- Output: `13`

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

This code uses a list to map the input integer `a` to specific output values. The list is indexed using the integer input from `raw_input()`. 

### List Breakdown:
The list is:
```
[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
The indices of this list correspond to the possible values of `a` (from 0 to 15). 

**Expected Output for Each Input:**
- For `a = 0`, output = 15
- For `a = 1`, output = 14
- For `a = 2`, output = 12
- For `a = 3`, output = 13
- For `a = 4`, output = 8
- For `a = 5`, output = 9
- For `a = 6`, output = 10
- For `a = 7`, output = 11
- For `a = 8`, output = 0
- For `a = 9`, output = 1
- For `a = 10`, output = 2
- For `a = 11`, output = 3
- For `a = 12`, output = 4
- For `a = 13`, output = 5
- For `a = 14`, output = 6
- For `a = 15`, output = 7

### Validating Against Input Constraints:
The constraints specify that the input integer `a` must be between 0 and 15, inclusive. The list used in the program has 16 elements, which indeed corresponds to all possible values of `a`.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `a = 0`, the program correctly outputs 15.
2. If `a = 15`, the program correctly outputs 7.
3. If `a = 8`, the program correctly outputs 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly maps each possible input value to its corresponding output value without any missing cases or logic errors. Every potential input from 0 to 15 has a valid output as specified in the example.

Correctness: **True**
