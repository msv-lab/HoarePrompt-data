To analyze the provided program, we need to consider the problem description and the specified behavior of the program.

**Problem description:**
The input is a single integer `a` (0 ≤ a ≤ 15). The output should be a single integer based on the input.

**Program:**
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program uses a list of integers to map input values (from 0 to 15) to corresponding output values.
2. The list is defined as:
   ```
   [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```
3. The program uses `raw_input()` to read the input, which is then converted to an integer and used as an index to access the list.

**Validating Inputs:**
- The valid inputs based on the problem description are integers from 0 to 15.
- The list has 16 elements (indexes 0 to 15), so the access using `int(raw_input())` should be valid for the inputs within the specified range.

**Key Cases:**
- For `a = 0`, the output is `15`.
- For `a = 1`, the output is `14`.
- For `a = 2`, the output is `12`.
- For `a = 3`, the output is `13`.
- For `a = 4`, the output is `8`.
- For `a = 5`, the output is `9`.
- For `a = 6`, the output is `10`.
- For `a = 7`, the output is `11`.
- For `a = 8`, the output is `0`.
- For `a = 9`, the output is `1`.
- For `a = 10`, the output is `2`.
- For `a = 11`, the output is `3`.
- For `a = 12`, the output is `4`.
- For `a = 13`, the output is `5`.
- For `a = 14`, the output is `6`.
- For `a = 15`, the output is `7`.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly handles all inputs in the specified range and produces the intended outputs as defined by the mapping in the list. There is no case where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program accurately maps each integer input in the range 0 to 15 to a corresponding output based on the provided list, fulfilling the problem's requirements.
