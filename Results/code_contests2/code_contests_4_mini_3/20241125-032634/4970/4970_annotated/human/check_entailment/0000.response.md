To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its behavior.

### Problem Description Recap
- Input: A single integer `a` where \(0 \leq a \leq 15\).
- Output: A single integer corresponding to the input.

### Annotated Program
```python
def func():
    print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

### Code Analysis
1. The program defines a function `func()` which reads an integer from input.
2. It uses `raw_input()` (which is Python 2 syntax; in Python 3, this should be `input()`).
3. The program accesses an array of integers with indices based on the input value `a`.
4. The hardcoded list is: `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

### Indexing and Output
The list has 16 elements (from index 0 to 15), which means valid indices for `a` are indeed from 0 to 15, as specified in the problem description. 

Here’s how the output maps for each input:
- Input 0 → Output 15
- Input 1 → Output 14
- Input 2 → Output 12
- Input 3 → Output 13
- Input 4 → Output 8
- Input 5 → Output 9
- Input 6 → Output 10
- Input 7 → Output 11
- Input 8 → Output 0
- Input 9 → Output 1
- Input 10 → Output 2
- Input 11 → Output 3
- Input 12 → Output 4
- Input 13 → Output 5
- Input 14 → Output 6
- Input 15 → Output 7

### Correctness Verification
The program correctly handles all integers in the specified range \(0 \leq a \leq 15\) by:
- Validating the range of input integers.
- Providing a corresponding output from the predefined list.

### Edge Cases
There are no edge cases or missing logic since:
- The index being accessed is always guaranteed to be valid due to the range check in the problem description.
- There are no unexpected inputs that could cause the program to fail.

### Conclusion
Since the program meets all requirements stated in the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The explanation for this conclusion is that the program correctly maps each input integer to its corresponding output as required by the problem description.
