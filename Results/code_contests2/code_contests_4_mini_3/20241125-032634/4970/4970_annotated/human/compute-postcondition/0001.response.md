The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it utilizes an internal integer `a` which must satisfy the constraint 0 ≤ a ≤ 15. The function's behavior and output are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return values based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to operate within the constraints of the integer `a`, but without further details, we cannot specify the output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with an internal integer `a` constrained to the range 0 ≤ a ≤ 15. The specific output of the function is not provided.**
