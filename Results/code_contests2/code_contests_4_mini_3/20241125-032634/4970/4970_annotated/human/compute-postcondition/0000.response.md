The code prints a value from a list based on an integer input. The input is taken from `raw_input()` which is converted to an integer using `int()`. The list has 16 elements indexed from 0 to 15. The integer `a` determines which index of the list to access, and `a` is guaranteed to be between 0 and 15 inclusive.

Since `a` is not specified, it can hold any value in the range of 0 to 15. The output will depend on what value of `a` is inputted. Therefore, for each possible value of `a`, there is a corresponding element in the list:

- If `a = 0`, the output is `15`
- If `a = 1`, the output is `14`
- If `a = 2`, the output is `12`
- If `a = 3`, the output is `13`
- If `a = 4`, the output is `8`
- If `a = 5`, the output is `9`
- If `a = 6`, the output is `10`
- If `a = 7`, the output is `11`
- If `a = 8`, the output is `0`
- If `a = 9`, the output is `1`
- If `a = 10`, the output is `2`
- If `a = 11`, the output is `3`
- If `a = 12`, the output is `4`
- If `a = 13`, the output is `5`
- If `a = 14`, the output is `6`
- If `a = 15`, the output is `7`

Thus, the output state can be summarized without specifying the exact value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `a` ≤ 15; the output is from the list based on the value of `a`.**
