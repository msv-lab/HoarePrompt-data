Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and prints an element from a predefined list based on the integer input received from the user. The input must be an integer within the range of 0 to 15, as it is used as an index to access the list. If the input is outside this range, it may raise an `IndexError`. The specific output depends on the user's input. **
