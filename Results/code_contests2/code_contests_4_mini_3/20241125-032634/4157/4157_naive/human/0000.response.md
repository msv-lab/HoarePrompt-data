To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and identify any potential edge cases.

The program is designed to calculate the time at which each trolleybus reaches the final station, considering their maximum speed, acceleration, and departure time. The key points from the problem are:

1. Each trolleybus starts from rest when it leaves the depot.
2. They can accelerate at a maximum rate `a` until they reach their maximum speed `v`.
3. If they catch up to another trolleybus, they will travel together at the speed of the first trolleybus they catch up to.
4. The output should be the time each trolleybus arrives at the station.

Now, letâ€™s examine the code:

```python
t = 0.0
(n, a, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
for i in xrange(n):
    (ti, v) = map(float, raw_input().split())
    t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
    t = max(t1 + ti, t)
    print(t)
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Catch Up Logic**: The program does not explicitly check if a trolleybus catches up to a preceding one. The logic should account for the time it takes for a trolleybus to reach a specific distance and check if it reaches that distance before or after the previous trolleybus.
   
2. **Acceleration and Maximum Speed**: The calculation of `t1` does not adequately handle the scenario where the trolleybus may not reach its maximum speed `v` before covering the distance `d`. It should consider the total time taken based on the acceleration profile, especially if the trolleybus does not reach its maximum speed before reaching the station.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program may fail in cases where the distance `d` is less than the distance a trolleybus can cover while accelerating to its maximum speed. In such cases, the formula used might not yield the correct time.

### Example Case to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
2 10 100
0 5
1 10
```

- For the first trolleybus: 
  - It departs at `t0 = 0` seconds. 
  - It can accelerate until it reaches its max speed of `5 m/s`.
  - The time to reach the station should be calculated based on how far it goes while accelerating.

- For the second trolleybus:
  - It departs at `t1 = 1` seconds.
  - Since it has a higher maximum speed, it may catch the first trolleybus.

The program does not consider that the second trolleybus might catch up to the first one and travel together after that point.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle the catch-up scenario and other potential acceleration issues, it will yield incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
