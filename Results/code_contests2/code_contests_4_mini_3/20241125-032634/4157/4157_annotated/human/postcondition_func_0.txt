The function accepts no parameters and reads multiple sets of input data consisting of integers and floats. It calculates a maximum time value `t` based on the inputs for departure times and speeds of vehicles, and prints this maximum time after processing each set of input. If no sets of data are provided (i.e., if `n` is 0 or negative), the function does not perform any calculations and `t` remains 0.0. The function also handles the case where the distance `d` is not achievable based on the speed `v` by using appropriate formulas to calculate time.
