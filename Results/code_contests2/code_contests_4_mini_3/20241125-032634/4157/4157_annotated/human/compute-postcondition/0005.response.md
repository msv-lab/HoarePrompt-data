The value of `t` is assigned the maximum of `t1 + ti` and `t`. The previous value of `t` is 0.0. The values of `t1`, `ti`, and `d` depend on the inputs, while `a` is an input integer. However, since `t1` is assigned based on a condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`, and without specific values for these, we cannot determine the exact value of `t1 + ti`. Therefore, the output state should reflect the ambiguity regarding `t1`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the input integer, `d` is the input integer, `ti` is the first input float, `v` is the second input float, `t` is either 0.0 or the maximum of `t1 + ti` and 0.0**
