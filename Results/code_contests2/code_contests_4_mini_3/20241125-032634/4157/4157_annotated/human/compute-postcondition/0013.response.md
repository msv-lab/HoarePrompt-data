The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned from the input values parsed as floats. The initial state mentions that `ti` is a first input float and `v` is a second input float, which means that they will take on the values provided in the input. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `d`, `t1`, `t`) remain unchanged at this stage. Therefore, the output state will reflect the newly assigned values of `ti` and `v` while noting that the values of other variables are still present as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `ti` is a first input float, `v` is a second input float**
