To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we analyze the assignment made to `t1`. The calculation depends on the values of `d`, `a`, and `v`. 

1. The expression checks if `d > v * v / (2 * a)`.
2. If this condition is true, `t1` is calculated using the formula:
   ```
   t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v
   ```
3. If the condition is false, `t1` is calculated as:
   ```
   t1 = math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
   ```
4. The variables `n`, `i`, and any other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Since `a`, `d`, and `v` are input integers and floats, respectively, and the specific values for these variables are not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `t1`. Instead, we will refer to the conditions and the variables that are involved.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `ti` is a first input float, `v` is a second input float, and `t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d`, `a`, and `v`.**
