The code assigns the values of `ti` and `v` by splitting the input string and converting the parts to floats. The previous values of the variables are not affected directly, but `ti` will now hold the first input float and `v` will hold the second input float. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `ti` and `v`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the input integer, `d` is the input integer, `ti` is the first input float, `v` is the second input float, `t` is 0.0**
