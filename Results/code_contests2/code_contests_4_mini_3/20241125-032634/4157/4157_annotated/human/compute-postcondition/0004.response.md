To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `t1` is being assigned a value based on the conditional expression.
2. The condition checks if `d > v * v / (2 * a)`.
3. If the condition is true, `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
4. If the condition is false, `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Given that:
- `n` is greater than 0 (this value does not directly impact the calculation of `t1`),
- `i` is 0 (also not directly impacting `t1`),
- `a` is an input integer,
- `d` is an input integer,
- `ti` is the first input float,
- `v` is the second input float,
- `t` is 0.0 (not affecting `t1`),

The output state will depend on the values of `a`, `d`, and `v`. However, since the exact values of these inputs are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `t1`.

Therefore, we summarize the output state by stating the conditions and the assignment operation without specific numerical outputs. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the input integer, `d` is the input integer, `ti` is the first input float, `v` is the second input float, `t` is 0.0; `t1` is assigned based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.**
