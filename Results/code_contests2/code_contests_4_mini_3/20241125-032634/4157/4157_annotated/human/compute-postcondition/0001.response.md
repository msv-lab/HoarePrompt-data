The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned from the input, which is read and split into three integers. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `d` were placeholders for the input values, but they are now replaced with the specific integers provided by the user. The other variables (`ti`, `vi`, and `t`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `a`, and `d`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `d` is the input integer, `ti` is a non-negative integer, `vi` is a positive integer, and `t` is 0.0**
