The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on a conditional expression that depends on the values of `d`, `v`, and `a`. 

1. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
2. If `d` is not greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` are not affected by this assignment. The specific output for `t1` depends on the input values for `a`, `d`, and `v`, but since those are unspecified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `t1`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the conditions and variables involved without specific calculations. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the input integer, `d` is the input integer, `ti` is the first input float, `v` is the second input float, and `t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.**
