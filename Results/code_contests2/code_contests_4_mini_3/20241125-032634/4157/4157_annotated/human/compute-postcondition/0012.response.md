According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. We also need to ensure that `n` is still greater than `i`. Since `n` is already greater than 0, we can keep the condition as is. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `ti` is a first input float, `v` is a second input float, `t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`, and `t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value; the value of `t` is printed.**
