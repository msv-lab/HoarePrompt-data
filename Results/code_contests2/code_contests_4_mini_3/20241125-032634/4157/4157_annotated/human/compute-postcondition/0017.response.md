According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. 

Since `n` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. To make this possible, `i` must be adjusted to 3 for the next iteration, and `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 3 to satisfy the condition.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 3 and `n` to be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `ti` is a first input float, `v` is a second input float**
