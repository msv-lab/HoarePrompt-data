According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1 because the loop iterates `n` times. The other variables `a`, `d`, `ti`, `vi`, and `t` do not directly affect the execution of the loop but may have implications on the loop body.

Before the loop starts, `t` is 0.0, and `i` will start at 0 (since `xrange` starts from 0). To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0. 

So, the necessary states to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the input integer, `d` is the input integer, `ti` is a non-negative integer, `vi` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0**
