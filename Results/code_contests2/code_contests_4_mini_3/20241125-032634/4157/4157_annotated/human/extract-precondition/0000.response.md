Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), a and d are positive integers (1 ≤ a, d ≤ 1000000), ti is a non-negative integer representing the time when the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot (0 ≤ ti ≤ 1000000), and vi is a positive integer representing the maximum speed of the i-th trolleybus (1 ≤ vi ≤ 1000000), with the condition that 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn ≤ 1000000.**
