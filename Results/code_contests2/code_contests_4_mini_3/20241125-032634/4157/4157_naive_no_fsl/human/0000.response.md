Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for the scenario where one trolleybus catches up with another. The logic in the program only calculates the time it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on its own departure time, speed, and acceleration, without considering the possibility that a trolleybus might be hindered by another trolleybus in front of it.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 10 10000
0 10
5 11
```

According to the problem description, the first trolleybus leaves at time `0` and reaches the final station in `1000.5000000000` seconds. The second trolleybus leaves at time `5` and has a higher maximum speed of `11`, but it cannot overtake the first trolleybus that leaves at time `0`. The second trolleybus will catch up to the first one at a certain distance and should continue at the same speed as the first one for the remaining distance.

However, in the program's implementation, the second trolleybus's arrival time is computed independently, which can lead to it arriving at a different time than it should due to the catching up. The logic does not handle the case of trolleys traveling together after catching up correctly.

Thus, since there are cases where the program will produce incorrect results, the overall correctness is deemed **False**.
