The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `d`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of trolleybuses, `a` is an integer, and `d` is an integer as well. Additionally, the function works with a list of trolleybus attributes where each trolleybus `i` has a non-negative float `ti` representing its time and a positive float `vi` representing its velocity. The constraints specify that the times are in increasing order and within the range of 0 to 10^6.

The function does not return a specific value or output description in the provided context. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), a (integer), and d (integer), and works with a list of trolleybus times (non-negative floats) and velocities (positive floats) that follow specified constraints. The specific output or behavior of the function is not defined based on the provided information.**
