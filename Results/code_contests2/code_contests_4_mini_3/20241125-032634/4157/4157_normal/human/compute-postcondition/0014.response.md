To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet:

1. The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on the conditional expression. 
2. The condition checks if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`. If true, `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. If false, `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.
3. After `t1` is calculated, `t` is updated to the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.
4. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n`, which is not directly involved in the calculations for `t1`.

Given that `ti`, `v`, `d`, `a`, and `n` are input values, the specific output state will depend on these inputs. 

The output state will report on the state of `t1`, `t`, and `i`:

Output State: **`t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d` and `a`; `t` is updated to max(t1 + ti, t); `i` is n.**
