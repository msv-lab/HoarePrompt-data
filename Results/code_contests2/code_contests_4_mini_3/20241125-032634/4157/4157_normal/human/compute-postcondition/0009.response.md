To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet:

1. The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on a conditional expression involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.
2. The expression includes:
   - A calculation using `v`, `a`, and `d` if the condition `d > v * v / (2 * a)` is true.
   - An alternative calculation using `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)` if the condition is false.
   
Since both `d` and `a` are not defined in the initial state, we can't calculate specific numeric values. However, we can describe the logic based on the existing variables.

The output will reflect the assignment of `t1` based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`, noting that `d` and `a` are not provided, which would normally be required for a complete evaluation.

Thus, the output state will mention the input values of `ti` and `v`, and that `t1` is assigned a value based on the conditional expression. 

Output State: **`ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float, `t1` is assigned based on the conditional expression involving `d` and `a`**.
