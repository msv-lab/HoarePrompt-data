The code updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The variables `t1`, `ti`, and `t` are involved in this computation, while the variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `t` after the calculation.

Output State: **`t` is updated to max(t1 + ti, t), `i` is n**
