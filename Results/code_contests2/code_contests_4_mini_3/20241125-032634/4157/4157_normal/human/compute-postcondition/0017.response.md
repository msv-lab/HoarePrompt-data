According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means that the loop cannot execute again as the condition `i < n` is not satisfied. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 to `n + 1`, and `n` remains the same. However, since `i` is already `n`, the only adjustment needed is to allow for a new value of `i` at the next iteration. 

State: **`t` is updated to max(t1 + ti, t), `i` is n, `n` is n**
