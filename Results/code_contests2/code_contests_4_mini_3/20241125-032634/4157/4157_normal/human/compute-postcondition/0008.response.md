The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned by taking input and converting it to float. The previous values of `ti` and `v` are unknown as they are based on user input. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is that `ti` is an input float, and `v` is an input float.

Output State: **`ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float**
