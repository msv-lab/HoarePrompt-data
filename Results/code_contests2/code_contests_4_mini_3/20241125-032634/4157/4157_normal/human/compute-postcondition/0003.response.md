The line of code reads inputs for `ti` and `v` as floats from user input, splitting the input string and converting each part into a float. The initial state includes `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, and `i`, but they remain unchanged by this line. Therefore, `ti` and `v` will hold the float values obtained from the user input, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), `d` is an integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float**
