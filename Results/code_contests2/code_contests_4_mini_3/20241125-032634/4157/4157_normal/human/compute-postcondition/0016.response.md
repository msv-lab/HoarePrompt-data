The code snippet `print(t)` outputs the current value of `t`. The previous value of `t` has already been updated to `max(t1 + ti, t)`, but since we do not have the specific values of `t`, `t1`, or `ti`, we can only describe the output state in terms of their relationship.

Output State: **`t` is updated to max(t1 + ti, t), `i` is n, and the function prints the value of t**
