To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), `d` is an integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float.

The code provided is:
```
t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
```

1. The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on the condition involving `d` and `v`.
2. If the condition `d > v * v / (2 * a)` holds true, then `t1` is computed using the expression `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
3. If the condition does not hold, `t1` is computed with `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

At this point, we need to consider the values of `v` and `a` to compute `t1`. Since `v` is an input float and `a` is a specific integer within its range, we cannot determine an exact numeric value for `t1` without knowing the values of `v` and `d`. However, we can note that the values of `t`, `i`, `ti`, and `t1` will be updated or computed based on the condition.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `t1` is computed based on the relationship between `d`, `v`, and `a`, while `t`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), `d` is an integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float, and `t1` is computed based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.**
