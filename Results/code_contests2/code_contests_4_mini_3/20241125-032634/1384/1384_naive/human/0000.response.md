Correctness: **False**.

The program currently uses `float` to read the input values for `t` and `x`, which is appropriate for handling the division but does not match the problem description's constraints that specify both `T` and `X` should be integers. 

Additionally, the output should be formatted to 10 decimal places as indicated by the problem description, but the program does not format the output. 

For example, if we input `8 3`, the expected output is approximately `2.6666666667`, but without proper formatting, the output may not match the requirement for precision.

Furthermore, if `X` is `0`, which is not allowed in this problem but could theoretically be inputted if the constraints were not enforced, the program would raise a division by zero error.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all aspects of the problem description.
