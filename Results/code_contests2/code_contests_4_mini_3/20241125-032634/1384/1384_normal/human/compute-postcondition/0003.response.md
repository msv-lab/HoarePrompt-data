The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads two floating-point numbers from the standard input, `t` and `x`, and then prints the result of dividing `t` by `x`. However, if `x` is zero, this will lead to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function includes the potential for an error when dividing by zero, but it lacks any error handling or return values to indicate such a situation.

Functionality: ** The function reads two floating-point numbers from input, divides the first by the second, and prints the result; however, it does not handle division by zero, which will cause an error if the second number is zero. **
