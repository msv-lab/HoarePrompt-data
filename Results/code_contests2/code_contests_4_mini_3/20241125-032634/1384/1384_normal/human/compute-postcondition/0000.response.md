The values of `t` and `x` are assigned the result of `map(float, input().split())`, which converts the input values to floats. The previous values of `T` and `X` are not directly affected, but now `t` and `x` will hold the float representations of the input values. The output state will reflect that `t` and `x` are now float values based on user input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100; `X` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is a float based on input; `x` is a float based on input**
