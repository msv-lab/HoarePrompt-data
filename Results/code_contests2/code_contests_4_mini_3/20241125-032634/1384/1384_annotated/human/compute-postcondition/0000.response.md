The variables `t` and `x` are assigned values based on the `input` function which takes two space-separated values and converts them to `float`. The previous values of `T` and `X` are not directly affected in this context, as `T` and `X` are not mentioned again after the input operation. Thus, the output state indicates that `t` and `x` will hold the float values obtained from the input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` and `x` are float values obtained from input.**
