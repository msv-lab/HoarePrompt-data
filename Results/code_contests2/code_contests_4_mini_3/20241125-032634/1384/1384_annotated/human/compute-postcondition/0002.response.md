The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates within the constraints that T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100. However, since no specific output or behavior is described in the output section, we cannot ascertain what the function returns or how it behaves based on the given constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined based on the provided information.
