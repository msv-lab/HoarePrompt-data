To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic it implements.

### Problem Breakdown
1. Ivan has `n` plates.
2. The first cake has `a` pieces, and the second cake has `b` pieces.
3. Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
4. No plate can have pieces from both cakes.
5. We want to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

### Code Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
(n, b, c) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Input Parsing**: The variables `b` and `c` are meant to represent the number of pieces of both cakes, but based on the problem description, they should be `a` and `b`. The code is incorrectly taking `b` and `c` from the input directly without assigning the correct values.
2. **Logic for Maximum Pieces**: The calculation of `x` (`max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`) does not logically follow the problem's requirements. The problem asks to find the maximum possible `x` such that each plate has at least `x` pieces, but the current formula does not ensure that the distribution adheres to the constraints.
3. **Distribution Calculation**: The final calculation `int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))` is incorrect. It does not account for the total pieces in relation to the plates correctly. It does not ensure that no plate has pieces from both cakes and does not adequately maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate.

### Test Cases
Let's consider a test case based on the problem statement:
- For `n = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`:
  - Correct output should be `1`, because each of the 5 plates can have at least 1 piece of cake.
- For `n = 4`, `a = 7`, `b = 10`:
  - Correct output should be `3`, because we can distribute pieces such that each plate can have at least 3 pieces.

Now, inputting these test cases into the provided code:
- **For the first case**: 
  - The code would produce an output that does not correspond to the expected logic of distributing pieces correctly.
- **For the second case**:
  - Similarly, the logic fails to yield the correct number of pieces per plate.

### Conclusion
Given the flawed logic in the code and the incorrect variable assignments, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
