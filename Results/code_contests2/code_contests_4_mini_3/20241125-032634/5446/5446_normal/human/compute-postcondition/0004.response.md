Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs `n`, `b`, and `c` from user input, calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, and then computes and prints the ceiling value of the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n`, multiplied by this ratio. It does not enforce any constraints on the inputs, potentially allowing invalid values that may lead to division by zero or other issues if `n` is greater than the minimum of `b` and `c`. **
