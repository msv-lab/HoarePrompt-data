To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet step by step:

1. The variables `n`, `b`, and `c` are integers taken from input.
2. `x` is calculated as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.
3. The expression `min(b, c) / float(n)` is computed.
4. This result is then multiplied by `x`.
5. The final result is passed to `ceil`, which rounds up to the nearest integer.
6. The `int()` function converts the result of `ceil` to an integer for printing.

Since the specific values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we denote the computed values generically in the output state.

The output state will reflect the calculation made by the print statement, including the fact that the print statement outputs an integer value.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, `c` are integers taken from input; `x` is calculated as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)); the result of print is int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))**
