The variable `x` is assigned the value of `max(b, c)` divided by `float(min(b, c))`. The values of `b` and `c` are integers taken from input, so `max(b, c)` will yield the larger of the two integers, and `min(b, c)` will yield the smaller. The final value of `x` will be a float. The states of `n`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, `c` are integers taken from input; `x` is the result of `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, `c` are integers taken from input; `x` is the result of `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))**
