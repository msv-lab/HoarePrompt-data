The function `func` accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, with both `a` and `b` being at least 1. It also accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. Based on the conditions provided, the function will execute certain logic. However, the specific output conditions are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b (both integers ≥ 1) and n (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b).**
