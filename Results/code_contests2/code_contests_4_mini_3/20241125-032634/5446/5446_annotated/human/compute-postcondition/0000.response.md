The code assigns values to `n`, `b`, and `c` from a list of integers obtained from user input through `raw_input()`, which splits the input string into separate components and converts them to integers. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly changed, but since `n` must satisfy the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, we know that `n` can be any integer within that range. The specific values of `n`, `b`, and `c` will depend on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer obtained from user input.**
