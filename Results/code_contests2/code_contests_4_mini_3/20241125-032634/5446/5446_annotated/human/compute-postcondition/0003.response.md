The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined with empty parentheses. However, it operates based on the constraints provided: `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \), where `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, with \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 100 \). 

Based on the output description, the function likely returns values based on the value of `n` in relation to `a` and `b`, but the specific output behavior is not provided. Therefore, we cannot detail the return values without further information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints that n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, where a and b are integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, both constrained between 1 and 100. The specific return values are not described.**
