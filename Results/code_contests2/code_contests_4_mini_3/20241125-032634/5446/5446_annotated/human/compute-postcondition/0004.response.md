Functionality: ** The function reads three integers from input (n, b, c) where n is constrained to be between 2 and the sum of a and b (however, a is never defined in the code, which could lead to confusion). It calculates the ratio of the maximum of b and c to the minimum of b and c, then uses this ratio to compute a result based on the minimum of b and c divided by n. The result is printed as an integer after applying the ceiling function. However, it does not return any value, and the constraints on a are not utilized in the function. Additionally, the function does not handle invalid input cases such as non-integer inputs.**
