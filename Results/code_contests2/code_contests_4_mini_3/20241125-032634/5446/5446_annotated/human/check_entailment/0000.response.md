Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. 

1. The input variables are read as `n, b, c`, but according to the problem description, these should correspond to `n` (number of plates), `a` (pieces of the first cake), and `b` (pieces of the second cake). This naming inconsistency can lead to confusion and incorrect calculations.

2. The calculation of `x` as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` does not reflect the logic required to maximize the minimum number of pieces on the plates. The goal is to distribute pieces of cake such that each plate has at least `x` pieces, but this calculation does not take into account how many plates can actually be filled with the available pieces of each cake while adhering to the conditions stated in the problem.

3. The output calculation `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))` is also incorrect. It does not ensure that the pieces are distributed correctly among the plates, and it does not maintain the condition that no plate can have pieces from both cakes.

For example, with the input `5 2 3`, the expected output is `1`, but the program's logic does not guarantee a correct calculation for all potential inputs, especially in edge cases where `a` and `b` are not sufficiently large to allow for the required distribution.

In conclusion, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem for various inputs, indicating that it is not correctly implemented.
