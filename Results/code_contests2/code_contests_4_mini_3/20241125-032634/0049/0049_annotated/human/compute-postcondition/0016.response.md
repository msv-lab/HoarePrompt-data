Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is an input string. If the character at index `i` (where `i` is `n - 2`) is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is set to `i`. If not, `flag` remains False and `pos` is undefined.***
