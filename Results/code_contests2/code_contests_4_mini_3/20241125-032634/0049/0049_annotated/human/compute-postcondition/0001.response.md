The variable `n` is reassigned to the first element of the map object `n[0]`. The previous value of `n` was a map object, and now `n` will hold that first element. The state of `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` and retains the current state of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map object, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
