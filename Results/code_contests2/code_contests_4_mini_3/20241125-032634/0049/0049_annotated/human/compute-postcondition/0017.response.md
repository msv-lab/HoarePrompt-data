According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` from 0 to `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is currently equal to `n - 2`, the loop can execute one more time when `i` is incremented to `n - 1`.

We need to adjust `i` to `n - 1`. The other states (`n`, `s`, `c`, `flag`, and `pos`) do not need to be modified for this iteration to occur, as they are not affected by the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is an input string, `i` is `n - 1`, `flag` is either True or False, and `pos` is either `i` or undefined.**
