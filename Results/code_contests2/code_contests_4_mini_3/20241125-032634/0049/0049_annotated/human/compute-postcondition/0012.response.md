Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is an input string. If the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. If the character at index `i` is less than or equal to the character at index `i + 1`, `flag` remains False and `pos` remains undefined.***
