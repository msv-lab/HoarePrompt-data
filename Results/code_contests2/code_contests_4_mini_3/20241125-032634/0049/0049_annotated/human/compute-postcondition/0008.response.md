Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is an input string. If the character at index `i` in `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is 0. If the condition is not met, the values of `flag` and `pos` remain unchanged, i.e., `flag` remains False and `pos` is not defined. Additionally, the condition assumes that `i` is a valid index such that `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `c`.***
