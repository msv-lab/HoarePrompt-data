Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 2, `c` is a string, `flag` is True, the output will be 'YES', along with the values `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, where `pos` is the last index where a character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If `n` is 1 or lower, `flag` is False, `pos` is not defined, `c` remains unchanged, and the output will be 'NO'.***
