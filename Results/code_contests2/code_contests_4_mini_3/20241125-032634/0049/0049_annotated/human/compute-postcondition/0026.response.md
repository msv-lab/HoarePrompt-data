Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (read from input) and a string `c` (also read from input) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters in the string such that the first character is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, it prints 'YES' and the 1-based indices of the pair; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is less than 2, the function will directly print 'NO' since there are no adjacent pairs to compare. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input format might be invalid, as it assumes valid input is provided.**
