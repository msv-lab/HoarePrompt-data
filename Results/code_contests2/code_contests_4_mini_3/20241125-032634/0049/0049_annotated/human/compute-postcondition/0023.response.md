The statement `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not affect any of the variable values in the current state. The variables `n`, `flag`, `pos`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 1 or lower, `flag` is False, `pos` is not defined, `c` remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`n` is 1 or lower, `flag` is False, `pos` is not defined, `c` remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed**.
