The value of `flag` is set to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new value of `flag` while the values of `n`, `s`, `c`, `i`, and `pos` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `i` is `n - 2`, `flag` is True, `pos` is undefined**
