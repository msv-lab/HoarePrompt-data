To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to identify a substring in the string `s` that, when reversed, results in a string that is lexicographically smaller than the original string. 

### Program Logic
1. The program reads the length of the string and the string itself.
2. It initializes a flag to track if a suitable condition is found.
3. It iterates through the string to find two adjacent characters where the first character is greater than the second (`c[i] > c[i + 1]`).
4. If such a pair is found, it sets the flag to `True`, stores the position, and prints "YES" along with the indices of the characters.
5. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program
- The program only checks for adjacent characters to determine if a reversal is possible. However, it may fail to identify non-adjacent substrings that could also result in a lexicographically smaller string when reversed.
- The problem states that if it's impossible to reverse any substring to get a smaller string, it should print "NO". The program may incorrectly print "YES" on finding any adjacent pair with `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, but there might be cases where reversing those characters does not lead to a smaller string.
- For example, consider the string "abcde". The program will not find any such pair and output "NO". However, if we had "abca", reversing the last "a" with the "b" would yield a smaller string.

### Test Cases
1. For input "abcde", the output should be "NO", which is correct.
2. For input "abca", the output should be "YES", and the program should identify indices to reverse the substring effectively.

### Conclusion
The program fails to comprehensively check for valid substrings beyond adjacent characters, which leads to it potentially missing valid cases. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
