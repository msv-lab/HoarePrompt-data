The function reads an integer `n` and a string `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists at least one character in `c` that is greater than the next character. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES' and the positions of the last occurrence of such characters (1-based index). If no such character exists or if `n` is less than 2, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1, which could lead to errors.
