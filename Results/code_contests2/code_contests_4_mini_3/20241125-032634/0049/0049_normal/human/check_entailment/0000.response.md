Upon reviewing the problem description, the task requires checking if it is possible to reverse a substring of the given string to produce a lexicographically smaller string. The output should indicate whether it is possible and, if so, provide the indices of the substring to reverse.

Looking at the provided program:

```python
import math
import collections

n = map(int, raw_input().split())
n = n[0]
c = raw_input()
flag = False
for i in range(n - 1):
    if c[i] > c[i + 1]:
        flag = True
        pos = i
if flag:
    print('YES')
    print(pos + 1, pos + 2)
else:
    print('NO')
```

The program checks if there exists at least one character in the string `c` that is greater than the next character. If such a character exists, it prints "YES" and the positions of the last occurrence of such characters (1-based index). If no such character exists, it prints "NO".

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program correctly identifies when there is a possibility to create a lexicographically smaller string by reversing a substring. This occurs when a character is greater than the subsequent character.
2. The program also correctly outputs the indices of the found positions. 

### Edge Cases:
1. The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2. However, the problem states that `n` will always be at least 2.
2. The program only returns the last occurrence if multiple pairs exist, which is acceptable since any valid pair suffices.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state that the function checks if there exists at least one character in `c` that is greater than the next character and outputs accordingly. This aligns with the actual code, confirming that the logic used to determine the output is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem description correctly for every potential case described by the problem. There are no identified edge cases or inconsistencies that would lead to incorrect behavior based on the provided description and the examples given.

Correctness: **True**.
