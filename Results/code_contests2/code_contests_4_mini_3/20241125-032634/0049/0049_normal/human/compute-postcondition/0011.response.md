The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `n` is greater than 1, `i` will have a value greater than or equal to 1. The previous values of `flag` and `pos` are not affected, as `flag` remains True or False based on the conditions not directly related to this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n - 1`, and `i` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 1**
