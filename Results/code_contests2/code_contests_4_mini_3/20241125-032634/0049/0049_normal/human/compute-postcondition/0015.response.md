The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n - 2`. The value of `i` is determined by the initial state where `n` is greater than 1, meaning `i` will be a non-negative integer. Other variables `s`, `c`, and `flag` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the input string, `i` is `n - 2`, `flag` is True, and `pos` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the input string, `i` is `n - 2`, `flag` is True, and `pos` is `n - 2**
