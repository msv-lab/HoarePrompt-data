Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the input string, and `i` is `n - 2`. If the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`). If the condition is not satisfied, the values of `flag` and `pos` remain unchanged, indicating that no update occurred.***
