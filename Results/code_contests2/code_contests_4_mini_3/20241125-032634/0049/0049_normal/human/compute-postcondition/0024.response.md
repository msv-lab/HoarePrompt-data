Postcondition: ***If `flag` is True, then 'YES' is printed along with the values `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, where `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of a character in `c` that is greater than the next character. If `flag` is False, indicating that either no such characters were found or that `n` is 1 or less, 'NO' is printed, and `pos` remains undefined.***
