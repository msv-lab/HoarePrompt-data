The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `n`, `flag`, and `pos` remain unchanged as the print statement does not alter any variable states. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variable states and notes the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `flag` is False, `pos` is undefined, and 'NO' is printed**.
