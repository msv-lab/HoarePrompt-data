The value of `c` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input. The variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is the first integer from the map object, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and `c` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the map object, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string**
