Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is the input string, then if the character at index `i` (where `i` is `n - 1`) is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `flag` is set to True and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. If `c[i]` is not greater than `c[i + 1]`, `flag` remains False and `pos` is not assigned. The variable `i` is always `n - 1`.***
