The variable `n` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` takes input as a string, `split()` divides it into separate components, and `map(int, ...)` converts those components into integers. Since `n` is initially defined as an integer and its specific value is not provided in the input, the output state reflects that `n` is now a map object of integers based on the input received. The string `s` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a map object of integers based on the input, and `s` remains a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
