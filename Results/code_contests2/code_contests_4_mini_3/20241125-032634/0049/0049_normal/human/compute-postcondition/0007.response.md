The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is set to True, `i` is 0, `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and `pos` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is set to True, `i` is 0, `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and `pos` is 0**.
