The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the condition \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\). The parameter `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the specified criteria. 

Since there are no specific return conditions or cases provided in the output section, I can only summarize what is known about the inputs. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
