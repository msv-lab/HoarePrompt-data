Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is empty (`{}`), which means it does not implement any logic to solve the problem. Therefore, it cannot handle any input or produce any output, making it impossible to satisfy the problem requirements. 

For example, if we input `9 7 3 8`, the program should calculate the minimal cost to build or demolish boxes to make the total number of boxes divisible by the number of delegations. However, since there is no code to perform this operation, the program will not work correctly for any input, including the given examples. Thus, it is incorrect.
