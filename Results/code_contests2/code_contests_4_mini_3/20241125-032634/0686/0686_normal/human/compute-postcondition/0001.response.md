The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n` and `m`, which are positive integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^{12}\), and `a` and `b`, which are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). The function processes these parameters and produces an output based on their values. However, the specific output behavior or conditions are not provided in the prompt. 

Since the output behavior is not specified, we can conclude that the function's functionality is centered around accepting these parameters without detailing the return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), m (a positive integer), a (an integer), and b (an integer) within the specified constraints.**
