The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as per the given definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers with values ranging from 1 to 10^12, and `a` and `b` are integers with values ranging from 1 to 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot describe the return values or conditions based on those constraints. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined due to the lack of information regarding its output or behavior based on the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, and the output is not specified.**
