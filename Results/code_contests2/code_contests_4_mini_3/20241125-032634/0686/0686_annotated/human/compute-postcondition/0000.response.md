The provided code snippet is an empty dictionary initialization (`{}`), which does not affect the existing variables `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. As a result, the values of these variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100**
