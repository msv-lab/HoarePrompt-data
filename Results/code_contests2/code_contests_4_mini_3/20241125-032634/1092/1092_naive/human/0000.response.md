Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly calculates the volume of the text. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the input text consists of multiple words. The variable `m`, which is supposed to store the maximum volume across all words, only updates based on the last word processed in the loop. Therefore, if the last word has a lower volume than a previous word, that volume will not be reflected in the final output.

For example, consider the input:
```
24
Hello World
```
The expected output should be `1` (since "Hello" has 1 capital letter and "World" also has 1 capital letter). However, the program will only count the capital letters in "World", leading to an incorrect output of `1`, but if there was a case where the last word had a higher volume than the first, it could result in an incorrect maximum volume. 

Another example:
```
24
This Is A Test
```
Expected output is `2`, but it would correctly calculate the maximum as `1` if the last word had fewer capital letters.

Hence, the program fails to account for all words properly, leading to incorrect results.
