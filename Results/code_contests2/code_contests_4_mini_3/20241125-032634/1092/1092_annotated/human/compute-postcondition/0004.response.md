The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect any of the other variables which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l`, `m` is 0, and `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l`, `m` is 0, `s` is 0**
