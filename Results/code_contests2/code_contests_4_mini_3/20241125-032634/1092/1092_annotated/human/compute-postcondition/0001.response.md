The variable `l` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which captures input as a string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this line of code. Since `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, it will not impact the output state. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `l` being a list of strings based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings from input**
