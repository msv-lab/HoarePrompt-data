According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `i`. If `i` contains at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is either 0 or 1, and `i` contains at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` must be the third element in the iterable.

State: **`s` is either 0 or 1, `m` remains the maximum between 0 and its previous value, `i` contains at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element of `i`**
