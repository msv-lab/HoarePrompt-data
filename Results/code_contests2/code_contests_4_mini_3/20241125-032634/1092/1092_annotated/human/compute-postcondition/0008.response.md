Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l`, `m` is 0, `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character `j` of the string `i` is an uppercase character. If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
