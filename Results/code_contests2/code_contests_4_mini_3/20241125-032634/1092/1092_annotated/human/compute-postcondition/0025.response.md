The value of `s` is incremented by 1. If `s` is initially 1, it will become 2. If `s` is initially 0, it will become 1. The previous values of `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is either 1 or 0; `m` is the maximum value between 0 and its previous value; `i` is an iterable with at least 2 elements; `j` is the second element of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is either 1 or 0; `m` is the maximum value between 0 and its previous value; `i` is an iterable with at least 2 elements; `j` is the second element of `i**
