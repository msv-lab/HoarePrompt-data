The variable `m` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of `n` and `l` does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings from input, `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings from input, `m` is 0**
