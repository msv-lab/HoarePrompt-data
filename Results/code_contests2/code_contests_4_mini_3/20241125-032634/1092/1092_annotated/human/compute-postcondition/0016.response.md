Output State: **`s` is the count of uppercase characters in the first string `i` of the list `l`. If `i` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute for each character in `i`, incrementing `s` for each uppercase letter. If `i` is an empty string, then the loop does not execute and `s` remains 0. If `i` has no uppercase letters, `s` will be 0, and if it has uppercase letters, `s` will contain the number of those letters.**
