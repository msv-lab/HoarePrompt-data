The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can be either 0 or 1, after the execution, the possible values for `s` are 1 or 2. The values of `m` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 0 or 1; `m` remains unchanged; `j` is the second element of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is 0 or 1; `m` remains unchanged; `j` is the second element of `i**
