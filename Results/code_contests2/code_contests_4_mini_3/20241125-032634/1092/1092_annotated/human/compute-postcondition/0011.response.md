Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l`, `m` is 0, and `s` is either 0 or 1. If the second character `j` of string `i` exists and is an uppercase character, then `s` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. If there is no second character in the string `i`, `s` remains 0.***
