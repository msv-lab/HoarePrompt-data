The code `raw_input()` is used to read a line from input. However, it does not affect any existing variables or change their states directly. The variable `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, while the text itself is a string of words. The execution of `raw_input()` will capture the input text but does not change `n` or any other state. Therefore, the output state is that `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and the string input is captured but not assigned or processed in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and the text is captured as input.**
