Postcondition: ***`s` is either 0 or 1, and if `j` (the second element of iterable `i`) is an uppercase letter, then `s` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` remains the maximum between 0 and its previous value, and `i` contains at least 2 elements. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged.***
