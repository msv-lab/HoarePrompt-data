According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`, which is the first string in the list `l`. Since `i` is a string, the loop will iterate over each character in that string. For the loop to execute, `i` must not be an empty string. Given that `l` has at least 1 string, we can assume that `i` is a non-empty string. The variable `j` will take on each character of `i` during the loop execution. 

At the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to the first character of `i` before the loop starts. Thus, we can set the state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l`, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, `j` is the first character of i**
