Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer that is either 0 or 1 based on whether the second element `j` of the iterable `i` is an uppercase character; if `j` is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `s` being 1), otherwise it remains 0. The integer `m` is the maximum value between 0 and its previous value, and `i` is an iterable with at least 2 elements. `j` is defined as the second element of `i`.***
