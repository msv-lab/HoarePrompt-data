The value of `s` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `m`, which represents the maximum value between `s` and its previous value, is not affected by this assignment since `s` is being initialized. Therefore, the output state is `s` is 0, and the value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is 0, and the value of `m` remains unchanged**
