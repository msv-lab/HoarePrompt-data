Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 2 characters, `m` is 0, and `s` is either 0 or 1. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being either 1 or 2. If `j` is not uppercase, the value of `s` remains unchanged at either 0 or 1.***
