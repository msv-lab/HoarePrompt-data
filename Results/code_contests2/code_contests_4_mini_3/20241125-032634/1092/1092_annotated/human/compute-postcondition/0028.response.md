The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Given that `s` is either 0 or 1, after execution, `s` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `j`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is either 0 or 1; `m` is the maximum value between 0 and its previous value; `i` is an iterable with at least 2 elements; `j` is the second element in `i`.

Output State: **`s` is either 0 or 1; `m` is the maximum value between 0 and its previous value; `i` is an iterable with at least 2 elements; `j` is the second element in `i`.**
