Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-empty string, `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character `j` of `i` is uppercase. `n` is between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 2 words, and `m` remains 0. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is increased by 1; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged at 0.***
