According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more character left in `i` beyond the current character being processed. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list, and `j` is the first character of `i`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive and `l` is a list containing at least 1 word, we need to assess the state of `i` for the loop to execute again.

Since `j` represents the current character being processed in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have at least one more character (i.e., the length of `i` must be greater than the current index of `j`). If `j` is the first character, then after the first iteration, `j` will shift to the next character in `i`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that the loop should continue processing the next character. Since `j` would be the second character in `i`, and `s` depends on whether this new character (the second character or beyond) is uppercase or not, we can assume the conditions are set for the next iteration.

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
- `s` should reflect the uppercase status of the next character in `i`.
- `i` should reflect the continuation to the next character.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list excluding its first character, `m` is 0, `s` is 1 if the second character of `i` is an uppercase letter, and `s` remains 0 if the second character of `i` is not an uppercase letter.**
