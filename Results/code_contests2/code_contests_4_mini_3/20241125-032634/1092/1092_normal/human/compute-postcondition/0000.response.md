The `raw_input()` function is intended to accept user input in Python 2. However, it does not affect the state of the variables `n` or the string of words provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, and the second line contains a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
