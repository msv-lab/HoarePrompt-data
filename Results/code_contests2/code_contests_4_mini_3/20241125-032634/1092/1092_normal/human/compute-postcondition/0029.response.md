Postcondition: ***`i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `s` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the next character in `i` (denoted as `j`) is uppercase, `n` is between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 2 words, and `m` remains 0. If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being 3. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains 2.***
