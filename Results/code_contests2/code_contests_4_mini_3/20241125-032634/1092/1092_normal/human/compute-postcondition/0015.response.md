According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which is the remaining characters of the first word in the list `l`, excluding its first character. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive.
- `l` is a list of words containing at least 1 word.
- `i` is the remaining characters of the first word in the list.
- `m` is 0.
- `s` is incremented by 1 if `j` is an uppercase letter; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still contain characters. That means `i` must have at least one character left after the last character was processed. If `i` had 1 character left at the end of the last iteration, it would be empty at the start of the next iteration. 

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to have at least one character remaining, which means it must have had at least 2 characters at the end of the last iteration. Consequently, if `i` is currently the characters of the first word excluding the first character, we need to specify that `i` should now represent the characters of the first word excluding the first character and the first character that was just processed.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 1 word, `i` is the remaining characters of the first word in the list excluding its first character and the first character processed, `m` is 0, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `j` is an uppercase letter; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
