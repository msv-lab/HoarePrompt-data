The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after the execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 1, `n` is between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 2 words, `m` is 0, and `j` is the first character of `i`, which is an uppercase letter.
