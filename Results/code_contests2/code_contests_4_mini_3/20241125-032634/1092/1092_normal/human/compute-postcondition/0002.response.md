The variable `m` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words split from the input string, and `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words split from the input string, and `m` is 0**
