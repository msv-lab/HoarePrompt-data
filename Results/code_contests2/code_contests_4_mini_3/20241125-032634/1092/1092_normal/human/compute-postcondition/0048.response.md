According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 4 words, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 3 words. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` must have at least 4 words, and the variable `i` should be updated to the next word in the list.

To adjust the state, we need to ensure that `i` reflects the next word in the list after the last processed word. If `i` was the last word in the list during the previous iteration, it needs to be set to the next word, which means `i` should be updated accordingly.

State: **`s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`, `n` remains between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 4 words, and `i` is the next word in the list.**
