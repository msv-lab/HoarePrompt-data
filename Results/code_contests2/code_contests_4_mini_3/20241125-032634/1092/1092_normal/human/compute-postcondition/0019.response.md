The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `s` is not specified, but it is being reset to `0`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, and `m`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 2 words, and `m` is the maximum of the previous value of `s` and 0, which is now `0`.

Output State: **`i` is a non-empty string, `s` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 2 words, `m` is 0**
