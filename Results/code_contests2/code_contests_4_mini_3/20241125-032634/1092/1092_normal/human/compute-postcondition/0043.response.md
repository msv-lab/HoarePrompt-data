The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` can either be 1 or 2, the new possible values for `s` will be 2 or 3, respectively. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is either 1 or 2; `n` remains between 1 and 200 inclusive; `l` is a list of words containing at least 3 words; `m` is either 0 or at least 1 depending on the value of `s`; `i` has at least 3 elements; `j` is the third element of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is either 2 or 3; `n` remains between 1 and 200 inclusive; `l` is a list of words containing at least 3 words; `m` is either 0 or at least 1 depending on the value of `s`; `i` has at least 3 elements; `j` is the third element of `i**
