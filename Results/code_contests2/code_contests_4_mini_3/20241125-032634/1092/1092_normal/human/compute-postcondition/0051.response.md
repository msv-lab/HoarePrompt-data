The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it works based on two constraints: an integer `n` which is between 1 and 200 inclusive, and a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we can summarize the accessibility of input and expected output based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not take parameters directly, but relies on an integer n (1 to 200 inclusive) and a string of space-separated words composed of Latin letters for its operation. The exact return value is not specified.**
