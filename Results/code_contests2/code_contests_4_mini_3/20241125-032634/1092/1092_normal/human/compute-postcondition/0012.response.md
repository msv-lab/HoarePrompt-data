According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `i`, which is the first word in the list `l` excluding its first character. The loop will execute again if there are more characters in `i` to iterate over. Given that `i` is currently the first word in the list excluding its first character, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` will represent the next character in the string `i`.

Since `i` is derived from a word in the list and has been processed for its first character, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to reflect the remaining characters of that word. 

If the length of `i` is more than 1, we need to adjust `i` to be the substring of `i` excluding the first character, which would effectively be `i[1:]`. If `i` has exactly one character, then there will be no more characters to iterate over in the next iteration.

Thus, we can summarize the adjustments as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 1 word, `i` is the remaining characters of the first word in the list excluding its first character, `m` is 0, and `s` is incremented by 1 if the character `j` is an uppercase letter. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged.**
