According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. Since `i` is a string with at least 2 characters at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be assigned the next character in the string `i`. 

If `i` has a total of `k` characters, and since the loop has already executed for the first `n` characters (where `n` is the number of iterations done so far), for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `j` corresponds to the `n+1`-th character of `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` is now set to the next character in the string `i`.

Since `s` indicates whether `j` is uppercase or not, we only need to adjust it based on the new character that `j` will take on. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `j` must be updated to reflect the next character in `i`.
2. `s` must be recalculated based on whether the new `j` is uppercase or not.

State: **`i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the next character in `i` is uppercase, `n` is between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 2 words, and `m` remains 0.**
