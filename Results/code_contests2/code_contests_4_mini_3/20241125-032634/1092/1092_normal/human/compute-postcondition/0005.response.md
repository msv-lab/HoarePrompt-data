According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is the first word in the list `l`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must contain at least one character. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is the first word in the list and the list has at least one word, we can conclude that `i` is not empty.

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `j` will represent the current character being iterated over in the word `i`. The initial value of `j` is not specified, but it will be the first character of the string `i` in the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, `j` is the first character of `i`**
