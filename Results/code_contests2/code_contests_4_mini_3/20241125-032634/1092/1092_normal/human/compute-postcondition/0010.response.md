The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is either 0 or 1, depending on the second character of the first word in the list `l`. Therefore, after execution, `s` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list excluding its first character, `m` is 0, `s` is either 1 or 2**
