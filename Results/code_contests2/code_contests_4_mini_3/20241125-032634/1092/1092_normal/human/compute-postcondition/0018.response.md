According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` contains more words, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a non-empty string, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` contains at least 1 word, and `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `l` contains at least 2 words. Since `i` will take the next word from `l`, it will be the second word in the list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`i` is a non-empty string, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words containing at least 2 words, and `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0**
