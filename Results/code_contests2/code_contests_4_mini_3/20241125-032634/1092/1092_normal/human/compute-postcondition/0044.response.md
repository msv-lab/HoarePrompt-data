Postcondition: ***If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being either 2 or 3; `n` remains between 1 and 200 inclusive; `l` is a list of words containing at least 3 words; `m` is either 0 or at least 1 depending on the value of `s`; `i` has at least 3 elements; and `j` is the third element of `i`. If `j` is not uppercase, all initial conditions remain unchanged.***
