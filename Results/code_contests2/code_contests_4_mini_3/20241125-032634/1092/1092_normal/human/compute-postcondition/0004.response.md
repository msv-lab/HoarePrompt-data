The variable `s` is initialized to 0, but no other variables are affected by this operation. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, and `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 0**
