The value of `s` is incremented by 1. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` was initially 1, making it 2 after the increment. If `j` is not an uppercase letter, then `s` was 0, making it 1 after the increment. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 1 if `j` is not an uppercase letter or 2 if `j` is an uppercase letter; `n` remains between 1 and 200 inclusive; `l` is a list of words containing at least 3 words; `m` is either 0 or at least 1 depending on the value of `s`; `i` has at least 2 elements; `j` is the second element of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is 1 if `j` is not an uppercase letter or 2 if `j` is an uppercase letter; `n` remains between 1 and 200 inclusive; `l` is a list of words containing at least 3 words; `m` is either 0 or at least 1 depending on the value of `s`; `i` has at least 2 elements; `j` is the second element of `i.**
