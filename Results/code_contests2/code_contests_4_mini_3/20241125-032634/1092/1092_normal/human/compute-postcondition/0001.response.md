The variable `l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes a string input of single-space separated words and splits it into a list of words. The value of `n` is not directly affected by this line of code, but it defines how many words might be inputted. Since `n` can be any integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `l` will contain a list of words based on the input string. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, and `l` is a list of words split from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, and `l` is a list of words split from the input string**.
