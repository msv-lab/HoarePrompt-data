Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a list of space-separated words from user input. It counts the maximum number of uppercase letters in any single word from that list and prints this maximum count. If no words are provided, the function prints 0. The function does not handle cases where the input may exceed 200 characters or where the input format is invalid. **
