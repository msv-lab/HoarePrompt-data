Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to calculate the volume of the text, which is defined as the maximum volume (i.e., number of capital letters) among all words in the text.

### Issue:
1. The program initializes `m` to 0 and then iterates through each word to count the number of uppercase letters in that word (`s`). However, it mistakenly updates `m` with the count of uppercase letters of the current word (i.e., `s`), rather than comparing it to the previously recorded maximum (`m`). 
2. The line `m = max(s, m)` should be placed after the inner loop, so that it compares the count of uppercase letters in the current word to the maximum found so far after counting all uppercase letters in that word.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
15
Hello World Example
```
- The first word "Hello" has 1 uppercase letter.
- The second word "World" has 1 uppercase letter.
- The third word "Example" has 1 uppercase letter.

The expected output is `1` since the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word is `1`. However, the program would return `0` because it initializes `m` to `0` and does not correctly compare the counts across all words.

Thus, the program fails to produce the correct output in several scenarios, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fulfill the requirements as described in the problem statement, leading to the determination of correctness as **False**.
