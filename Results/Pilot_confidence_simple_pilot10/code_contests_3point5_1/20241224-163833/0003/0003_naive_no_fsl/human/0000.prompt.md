You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Note that this is the first problem of the two similar problems. You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems.

You are given a tree with n nodes. In the beginning, 0 is written on all edges. In one operation, you can choose any 2 distinct leaves u, v and any real number x and add x to values written on all edges on the simple path between u and v.

For example, on the picture below you can see the result of applying two operations to the graph: adding 2 on the path from 7 to 6, and then adding -0.5 on the path from 4 to 5. 

<image>

Is it true that for any configuration of real numbers written on edges, we can achieve it with a finite number of operations?

Leaf is a node of a tree of degree 1. Simple path is a path that doesn't contain any node twice.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of nodes.

Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v), meaning that there is an edge between nodes u and v. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.

Output

If there is a configuration of real numbers written on edges of the tree that we can't achieve by performing the operations, output "NO". 

Otherwise, output "YES". 

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input


2
1 2


Output


YES

Input


3
1 2
2 3


Output


NO

Input


5
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5


Output


NO

Input


6
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6


Output


YES

Note

In the first example, we can add any real x to the value written on the only edge (1, 2).

<image>

In the second example, one of configurations that we can't reach is 0 written on (1, 2) and 1 written on (2, 3).

Below you can see graphs from examples 3, 4:

Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    out = []
    class graph:
    
        def __init__(self, gdict=None):
            if gdict is None:
                gdict = defaultdict(list)
            (self.gdict, self.edges, self.l) = (gdict, defaultdict(int), defaultdict(int))
    
        def addEdge(self, node1, node2, w=None):
            self.gdict[node1].append(node2)
            self.gdict[node2].append(node1)
            self.l[node1] += 1
            self.l[node2] += 1
    n = int(input())
    g = graph()
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        (u, v) = rints()
        g.addEdge(u, v)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if g.l[i] != 1 and g.l[i] < 3:
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
