Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program fails to handle certain cases where the tree structure allows for configurations that cannot be achieved with the given operations. Specifically, the program checks if the degree of each non-leaf node is at least 3. However, this check is insufficient to determine if the tree can achieve any configuration of real numbers on its edges.

Consider the following case:
- Input:
```
5
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
```
- Expected Output:
```
NO
```
- Program Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, the tree has a node (node 1) with a degree of 4, which means it can theoretically handle more complex configurations. However, the current implementation incorrectly returns "YES" because it only checks if the degree of non-leaf nodes is at least 3, which is not a sufficient condition.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to ensure that the tree can be decomposed into simpler structures (like paths and cycles) that allow for arbitrary configurations through the given operations. The current implementation does not cover this requirement comprehensively.
