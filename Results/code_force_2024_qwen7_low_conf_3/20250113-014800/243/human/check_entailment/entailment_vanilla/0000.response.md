### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the type (funny or scary) of the undecided transition videos in such a way that no sequence of transition videos exceeds \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type consecutively, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input and counts the number of already determined transition videos (`F` or `S`) for each scenario.
   - It also keeps track of undecided transition videos represented by `?`.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - The program categorizes scenarios into two lists: `sa` for those with more `F` than `S` and `sb` for those with more `S` than `F`.
   - If the count of `sa` is greater than or equal to `sb`, it assigns `F` to the undecided ones in `sa` until reaching the limit of \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) (considering the floor division).
   - Otherwise, it assigns `S` to the undecided ones in `sb` until reaching the same limit.

4. **Assigning Values**:
   - For each undecided transition video (`?`), the program checks if the current scenario or the destination scenario is among the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) scenarios assigned `F` or `S`. If so, it assigns the opposite value to ensure the consecutive limit is not exceeded.
   - Otherwise, it assigns the remaining value (`F` or `S`) to ensure the limit is met.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - The program generates the final matrix of transition videos and prints it.

### Verification:
- The logic of the program seems to address the problem requirements correctly by ensuring the consecutive limit is not exceeded and by assigning values appropriately.
- The program handles all given constraints and examples as expected.

### Conclusion:
- The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
