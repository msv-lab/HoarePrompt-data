Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios. 

Let's consider the following example:

Input:
```
4
..FS
.S.?
??.S
.?F.
```

Expected output (one valid solution):
```
..FF
SF.S
.FSF
.FFS
```

However, the provided program does not generate a valid solution. For instance, for the permutation of scenarios as 1, 2, 3, 4, the sequence of transition videos would be `FFSFS`, which has 3 consecutive scary (`S`) videos, violating the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 4}{4} \rceil = 3\) consecutive scary videos.

The program logic does not adequately distribute the types of transition videos to meet the requirement. It simply appends `F` or `S` based on the index, which does not guarantee the required constraint. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to satisfy the problem's requirements for all inputs.
