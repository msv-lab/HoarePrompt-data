Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly processes the input to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario, which is essential for determining the undecided values ('?').

2. **Deciding Values**: 
   - The program identifies indices where only 'F' or only 'S' are already determined.
   - It then decides the values for '?' based on the condition that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type should appear for any permutation of the scenarios.
   - The logic in the if-else block ensures that the undecided values are set to 'F' or 'S' in such a way that the condition is met.

3. **Output Construction**: The program constructs the output grid by iterating through the input grid and replacing '?' values based on the previously identified indices and conditions.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the boundary conditions properly, ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' occur for any permutation of scenarios.

Given the structure of the code and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program ensures that the constraints are met and produces a valid solution for any valid input within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
