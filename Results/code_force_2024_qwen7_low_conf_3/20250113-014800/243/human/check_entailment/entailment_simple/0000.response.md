Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Deciding Transition Videos:**
   - The logic used to decide whether a transition video should be 'F' or 'S' is flawed. The program does not consider the global constraints on consecutive videos of the same type for all permutations of scenarios.
   - For instance, the program uses `sa` and `sb` to append indices where only one type of transition video is decided, but it does not ensure the constraints are met for all possible permutations.

2. **Lack of Constraint Satisfaction:**
   - The program does not implement a mechanism to ensure that no matter the order of scenarios, the sequence of transition videos does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
   - The decision-making process based on the indices in `sa` and `sb` does not guarantee that the constraints will be satisfied for all permutations of scenarios.

3. **No Consideration for Multiple Solutions:**
   - The program assumes a straightforward way to fill in undecided transition videos (`?`) without considering the complex interdependencies required to satisfy the constraint for all permutations.

### Example where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
5
...??
.F??? 
.??.?
??.?.
?...?
```

The program might output:
```
FFFSS
FF.SS
FSS.F
SSSFF
SFF..
```

However, for the permutation `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]`, the sequence of transition videos would be `F.SFF`, which has 3 consecutive 'F' videos, violating the constraint of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
