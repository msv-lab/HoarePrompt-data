Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `xx[i][0]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`, and `nx` is updated based on the condition: if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is appended with `'F'`; otherwise, `nx` is appended with `'S'`.***
