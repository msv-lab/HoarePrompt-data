Postcondition: ***`i` is in the range [1, n], `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then the index `i` is added to the list `sa`. If the condition `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` is not met, the list `sa` remains unchanged.***
