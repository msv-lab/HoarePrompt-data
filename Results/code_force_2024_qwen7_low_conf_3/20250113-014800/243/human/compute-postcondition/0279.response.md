The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the current value of `nx`. To determine the new value of `nx`, we need to consider its initial definition:

- Initially, `nx` is defined as follows:
  - If `xx[3][0]` is not `?`, then `nx = xx[3][0]`.
  - Otherwise, `nx = 'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx = 'F'`.

Given that `i` is 3 and `j` is 2, we need to know the value of `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` to determine the value of `nx` when `xx[3][0]` is `?`. However, since `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` is not defined in the initial state, we can only consider the conditions based on the given values of `i` and `j`.

Since both `i` (3) and `j` (2) are not specified in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, the condition for `nx` being `'S'` when `xx[3][0]` is `?` does not apply. Therefore, the initial value of `nx` is `'F'`.

After executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` becomes `'FS'`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 2, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is `'FS'`**
