Postcondition: ***`nx` is a string constructed based on the rules described. If either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` ends with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` ends with 'S' and has been modified by appending 'S' to it. `i` is `k + 1`, `k + 1` is less than `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as `'?'`.***
