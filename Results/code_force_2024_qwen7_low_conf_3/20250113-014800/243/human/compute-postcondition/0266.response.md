The code `nx = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. This means that the previous value of `nx`, which was the concatenation of the values `xx[2][n - 1], xx[3][n - 1], ..., xx[n][n - 1]` (including the third element if it wasn't already included), is replaced by an empty string. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is an empty string**
