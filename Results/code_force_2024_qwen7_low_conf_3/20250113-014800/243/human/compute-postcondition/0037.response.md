The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` starts from 1, the initial value of `a[j]` is 1 (since `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`). After incrementing, `a[j]` will become 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with `a[j]` equal to 2, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x]`, `x[j - 1]` is 'F'**
