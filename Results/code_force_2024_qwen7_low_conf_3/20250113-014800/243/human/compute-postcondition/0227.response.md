`nx` is assigned the value `'S'` concatenated to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify what `nx` was before, we consider it as an empty string for this calculation. After the operation, `nx` will be `'S'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is `'S'`**
