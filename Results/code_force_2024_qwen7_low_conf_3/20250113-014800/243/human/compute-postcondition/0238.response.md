The code `print(nx)` simply prints the value of the variable `nx`. Since the printing operation does not modify any variables, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `nx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that the value of `nx` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is printed.**
