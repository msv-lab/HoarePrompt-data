Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing indices `j` for which `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`. If `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0`, then `sb` includes the value 2.***
