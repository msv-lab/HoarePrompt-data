`nx` is assigned the value `'S'`. The value of `nx` is initially empty, so now it contains `'S'`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition about `i` being in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` being in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, `nx` is `'S'`, `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**
