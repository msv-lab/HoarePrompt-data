The code snippet appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 1
- `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`
- `nx` is an empty string
- `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`

The operation `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[3][0]` to `nx`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, it must be a specific value. From the initial state, we know that `xx[i][j - 1]` corresponds to `xx[3][0]`.

Therefore, `nx` will be updated to the value of `xx[3][0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is `xx[3][0]`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`**
