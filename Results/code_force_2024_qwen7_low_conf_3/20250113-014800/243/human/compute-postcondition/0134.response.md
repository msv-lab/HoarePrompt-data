Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`.
   - `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`.
   - `t` is the length of `sa`.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 starting from 1 up to `n + 1`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, `nx` is updated by appending the value of `val` to `nx`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is either `'F'` or `'S'`, and either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be within the range 1 to `n + 1`.
   - After the last iteration, `j` would be `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` should be 1 (since the loop starts again from 1).

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `j` will start from 1 in the next iteration, the new state of `j` will be `1`.
   - All other variables should remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains within the range 1 to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.
   - `a` and `b` lists remain unchanged.
   - `sa` and `sb` lists remain unchanged.
   - `t` remains the length of `sa`.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `xx[i][0]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`.**
