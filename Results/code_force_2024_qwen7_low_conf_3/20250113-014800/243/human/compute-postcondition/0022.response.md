Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[j]` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `x[j-1]` was 'F'; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[j]` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether `x[j-1]` was 'S'; `xx` is `['']`; and `x` is an input string. No changes are made to the lists if `x[j-1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S'.**
