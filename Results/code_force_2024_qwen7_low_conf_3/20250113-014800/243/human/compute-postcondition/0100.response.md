Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the values [1, 2], `sb` is a list containing the value 1. If `a[2] > 0` and `b[2] == 0`, then `sa` is a list containing the values [1, 2]. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
