Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nx` is a string constructed based on the rules described.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `k + 1` is less than `n + 1`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is extended by `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` ends with 'F' if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` ends with 'S' and has had 'S' appended to it.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Check Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, `j` will now be `n + 1`.
   - `i` remains `k + 1`.
   - We need to check if `k + 1` is still less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue. Given that `k + 1` was less than `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain true unless `k` changes.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `nx` will be updated based on the condition inside the loop for the new value of `j`.
   - If `xx[i][n]` (the character at position `n` in `xx[i]`) is not '?', `nx` will be extended by this character.
   - Otherwise, `nx` will end with 'F' if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `n` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` will end with 'S' and have 'S' appended to it.

6. **Final State:**
   - The state needs to reflect the update of `nx` based on the condition for `j = n + 1`.

**State:**
- `nx` will be updated based on the conditions specified for `j = n + 1`.
- `i` remains `k + 1`.
- `k + 1` must still be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**State: **`nx` is a string updated based on the condition for `j = n + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`.**
