The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Given the initial state where `nx` is a string updated based on the condition for `j = n + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, the value of `nx` changes but the conditions for `j`, `i`, and the relationship between `k` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the original string plus 'S', `j` = `n` + 1, `i` = `k` + 1, and `k` + 1 < `n` + 1**
