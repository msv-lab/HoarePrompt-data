`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` concatenated with the string `'S'`. This means that `nx` will now contain the string `'S'` appended to its current value. The initial value of `nx` is an empty string, so after this operation, `nx` will become `'S'`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `nx` is `'S'`, and `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`**
