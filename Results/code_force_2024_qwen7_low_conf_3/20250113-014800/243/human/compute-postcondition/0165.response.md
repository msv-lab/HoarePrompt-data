Postcondition: ***`nx` is a string. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Otherwise, `nx` is updated as follows: if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is the original string updated for `j = n + 1` plus 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original string plus 'S', with `j` = `n` + 1, `i` = `k` + 1, and `k + 1` < `n + 1`.***
