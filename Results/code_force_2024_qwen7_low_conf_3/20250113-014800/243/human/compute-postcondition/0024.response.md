The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a` or `i`. Therefore, we can only state that the value at index `i` of list `a` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **the value at index `i` of list `a` is increased by 1**
