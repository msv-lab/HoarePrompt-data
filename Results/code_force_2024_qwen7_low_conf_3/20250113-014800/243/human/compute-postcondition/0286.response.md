The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` can be one of the following: `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1]`, `'FS'`, `'SF'`, or `'FF'`.

Let's consider each case:

1. If `nx` is `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1]`, appending 'F' would make it `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1] + 'F'`.
2. If `nx` is `'FS'`, appending 'F' would make it `'FSF'`.
3. If `nx` is `'SF'`, appending 'F' would make it `'SFF'`.
4. If `nx` is `'FF'`, appending 'F' would make it `'FFF'`.

Since the exact value of `nx` depends on `xx[3][0]`, `xx[3][1]`, and other conditions, we cannot simplify it further without more information. However, we know the operation performed.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 3, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, depending on `xx[3][2]` and `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1] + 'F'` if `nx` was `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1]`, `'FSF'` if `nx` was `'FS'`, `'SFF'` if `nx` was `'SF'`, and `'FFF'` if `nx` was `'FF'`**
