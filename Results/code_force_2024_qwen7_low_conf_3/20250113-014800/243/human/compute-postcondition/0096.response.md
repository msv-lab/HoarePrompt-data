The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and `sa` is a list containing the value 1, the value of `i` is appended to `sb`.

Since `i` is 1, the list `sb` will now contain `[1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `sa` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` is a list containing the value 1.**
