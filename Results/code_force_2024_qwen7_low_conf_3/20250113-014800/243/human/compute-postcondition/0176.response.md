Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop variable and its range**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from 1 up to `n`.

2. **Current state of variables**:
   - `nx` is an empty string.
   - `i` is `k + 2`.
   - `k + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `j`**:
   - According to the current state, `j` is `n + 1`. However, the loop starts with `j` as 1 and increments `j` by 1 until it reaches `n + 1`.

4. **Check if the loop can start**:
   - For the loop to start, `j` should be within the range [1, n + 1). Since `j` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will not start because `j` is already outside the range.

5. **Adjust the state to allow the loop to execute**:
   - To allow the loop to start, `j` needs to be set to 1 initially. The other variables (`nx`, `i`, and `k`) do not directly affect the loop's starting condition but may be modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `k + 2`, `k + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, `j` is 1**
