Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 1
- `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`
- `nx` is either `xx[3][0]` if `xx[3][0]` is not `?`, otherwise `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is `'F'`

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1 and the loop condition is `j < n + 1`, the loop will execute again if `j` is incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `j` will be updated to 2.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because the loop is iterating over `j`.
   - `xx[1][n - 1]` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the value of `j`.
   - `nx` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes its value, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `nx` stays the same.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is still 3
- `j` is now 2
- `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`
- `nx` is either `xx[3][0]` if `xx[3][0]` is not `?`, otherwise `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is `'F'`

Given this analysis, the state to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 2, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is either `xx[3][0]` if `xx[3][0]` is not `?`, otherwise `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is `'F'`**
