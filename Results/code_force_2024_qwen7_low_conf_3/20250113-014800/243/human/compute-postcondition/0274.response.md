The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given the initial state where `nx` is an empty string, after appending 'F', `nx` will become 'F'. The other variables `i`, `j`, `xx[1][n - 1]`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition related to `sb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is 'F', `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**
