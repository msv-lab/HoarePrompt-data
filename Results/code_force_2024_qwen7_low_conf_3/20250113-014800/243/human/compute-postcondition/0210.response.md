The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sb`. Since the initial state is given, and `i` is 2, appending 2 to `sb` will add 2 to the list `sb`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing indices `j` for which `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, and `sb` now includes the value 2.**
