The code snippet `xx.append(x)` appends the string `x` to the list `xx`. The initial state is given as follows:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` is incremented by 1 for every 'F' at index `i-1` in `x` and by 2 for every 'F' at any other index `j-1` in `x`.
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` is incremented by 1 for every 'S' at index `i-1` in `x` and by 2 for every 'S' at any other index `j-1` in `x`.
- `xx` is `['', x]`.
- `x` is the input string.

After executing `xx.append(x)`, the list `xx` will have two elements: an empty string and the string `x`, followed by another instance of the string `x`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x, x]`, `x` is the input string.**
