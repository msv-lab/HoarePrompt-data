Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is a string constructed based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations.**

To derive this, let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` starts at 3.
   - `j` starts at `n + 1`.
   - `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`.
   - `nx` is initially an empty string.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - For each iteration, the following logic is applied:
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, then `nx` is appended with `xx[i][j - 1]`.
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, then:
       - If either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is appended with 'S'.
       - Otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'F'.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes (i.e., `j` goes from 1 to `n + 1`), the final value of `nx` will be a string constructed by appending characters based on the above rules.
   - Specifically, for each `j` from 1 to `n`, the character `xx[i][j - 1]` is checked:
     - If it is not `?`, `nx` gets appended with that character.
     - If it is `?`, `nx` gets appended with 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise it gets appended with 'F'.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
   - The value of `j` reaches `n + 1` after the loop.
   - The value of `xx[1][n - 1]` remains unchanged as it is only read during the loop.

Thus, the output state after the loop completes is that `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is a string constructed according to the rules described in the loop.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is a string constructed based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations.**
