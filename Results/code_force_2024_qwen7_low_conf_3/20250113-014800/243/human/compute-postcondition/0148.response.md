According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `i`. The loop starts from 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current value it ended at, and `n` is the upper limit of the loop.

Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop just finished an iteration, let's assume `i` was some value `k` at the end of the last iteration.

2. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Update the State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - To allow the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given that the previous state is:
- `nx` is the string constructed based on the rules described, which depends on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, `j`, `sa`, and `sb`.

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration:

- The value of `i` will be incremented by 1, so if it was `k` before, it will now be `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` will be `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`nx` is the string constructed based on the rules described, which depends on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, `j`, `sa`, and `sb`, `i` must be less than `n + 1`**.
