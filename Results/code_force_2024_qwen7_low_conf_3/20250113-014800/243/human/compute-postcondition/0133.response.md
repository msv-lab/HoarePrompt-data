Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `xx[i][j - 1]` is either '?' or not '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by appending the value of `val` to `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', and either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.***
