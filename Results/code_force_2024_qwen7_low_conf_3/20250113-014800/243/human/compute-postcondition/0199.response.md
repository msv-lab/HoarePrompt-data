The code `print(nx)` simply prints the value of `nx` without changing its value. Therefore, the value of `nx` remains unchanged after executing this line of code.

Output State: **`nx` is a string formed by concatenating `xx[i][j - 1]` for all `j` from 1 to `n`, where if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, it is directly added to `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, `nx` is appended with `'F'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise it is appended with `'S'`.**
