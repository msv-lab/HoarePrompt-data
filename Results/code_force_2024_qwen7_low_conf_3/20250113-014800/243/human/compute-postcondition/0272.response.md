`nx` is concatenated with the string `'S'`, which means `nx` now holds the value `'S'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is `'S'`, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is `'S'`, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?**
