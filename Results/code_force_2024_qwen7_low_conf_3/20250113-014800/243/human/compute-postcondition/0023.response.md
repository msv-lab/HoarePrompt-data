According to the code, the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `j` would have been `n`, because the loop increments `j` each time it runs.

Here are the steps to determine the new state:

1. **Determine the new value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` each iteration and the loop runs up to `n + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `n + 1`.

2. **Check the conditions for the lists `a` and `b`:**
   - The lists `a` and `b` should maintain their lengths as `n + 1` and should contain values based on the characters in the string `x`.
   - No changes are made to these lists if `x[j-1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S'. 

3. **Check the condition for `xx`:**
   - The list `xx` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but it's mentioned that no changes are made to the lists if `x[j-1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S'.

4. **Check the condition for `x`:**
   - The string `x` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but since no changes are made to `x` in the loop, it stays the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the new value of `j` and confirm that the conditions for the lists `a` and `b` remain the same.

**State:**
**`n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[j]` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `x[j-1]` was 'F'; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[j]` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether `x[j-1]` was 'S'; `xx` is `['']`; and `x` is an input string; `j` is `n + 1`.**
