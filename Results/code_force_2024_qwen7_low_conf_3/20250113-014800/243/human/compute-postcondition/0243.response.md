The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by appending the character from `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n`
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive
- `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?` but is not `?`
- `nx` is ''
- `nx` is printed

Since `xx[1][n - 1]` is not `?`, it must be `val`. Also, `j` is `n`, so `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[2][n - 1]`, which is `val`.

Thus, `nx` is updated to `val`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is `val`, `nx` is `val', and `nx` is printed**
