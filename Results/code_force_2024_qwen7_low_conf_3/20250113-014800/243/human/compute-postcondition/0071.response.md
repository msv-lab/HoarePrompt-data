Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x, x]`, and `x` is the input string. If `x[j - 1]` (i.e., `x[0]`) is 'F', then `a[1]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `b[1]` is incremented by 2. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[1]` is further incremented by 2.***
