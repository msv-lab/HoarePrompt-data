The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string `'S'` to the existing value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` can be either `'val'`, `'S'`, or `'F'`.

- If `nx` is `'val'`, appending `'S'` results in `'vals'`.
- If `nx` is `'S'`, appending `'S'` results in `'SS'`.
- If `nx` is `'F'`, appending `'S'` results in `'FS'`.

The values of `i`, `j`, and `xx[1][n - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is either `'vals'`, `'SS'`, or `'FS'`**
