`nx` is concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. The value of `i` is `k + 1`, which is less than `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. After executing the code, the value of `nx` changes to include the additional character from `xx[i][j - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is a string that is `nx` plus `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is `k + 1`, `k + 1` is less than `n + 1`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
