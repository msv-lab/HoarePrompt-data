Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is `n + 1`
   - `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`
   - `nx` is one of the following: `'valval'`, `'val?'`, `'Sval'`, `'S?'`, `'Fval'`, `'F?'`, `'valF'`, `'SF'`, `'FF'`, `'vals'`, `'SS'`, or `'FS'`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive). So the loop condition is `j in range(1, n + 1)`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`. This means that the loop has already reached the upper limit of its range, and therefore it cannot execute another iteration.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range `1` to `n` (inclusive). Since `j` starts from `1` and increases by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as the loop does not affect `i`.
   - `j` needs to be set to `n` for the next iteration.
   - `xx[1][n - 1]` remains the same since the loop does not affect this variable.
   - `nx` remains the same since the loop does not affect this variable.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is one of the following: `'valval'`, `'val?'`, `'Sval'`, `'S?'`, `'Fval'`, `'F?'`, `'valF'`, `'SF'`, `'FF'`, `'vals'`, `'SS'`, or `'FS'`**
