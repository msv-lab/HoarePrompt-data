The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character `'F'` to the list `nx`. No other variables are affected by this operation. 

Given the initial conditions and the precondition that `nx` is a list (which may or may not contain elements), the new value of `nx` will be the previous value of `nx` with `'F'` appended to it. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `xx[i][0]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`, and `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus `'F'`.**
