Functionality: **The function processes an \(n \times n\) grid of characters representing transition videos between scenarios (F for funny, S for scary, ? for undecided, and . for no transition video). It ensures at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided. The function determines two sets of indices, `sa` and `sb`, which represent indices where only 'F' or only 'S' videos are present, respectively. If the number of indices in `sa` is greater than or equal to the number in `sb`, the function sets the undecided videos ('?') to 'F' under certain conditions. Otherwise, it sets them to 'S'. Finally, it prints the modified grid, where undecided videos have been replaced by 'F' or 'S' according to the conditions described. The function handles the case where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\) and ensures the grid is processed correctly even if no indices in `sa` or `sb` meet the specified conditions. If neither set `sa` nor `sb` contains valid indices, the undecided videos remain unchanged.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If \(n < 2\) or \(n > 24\), the function will raise an error because these values are out of the allowed range. However, the function does not explicitly handle this case.
- If no indices in `sa` or `sb` are valid, the function does not explicitly handle this scenario, meaning the undecided videos ('?') will not be modified, which might not be the intended behavior if such a case is possible.
