`b[j]` is incremented by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `b[3]` is incremented by 1. The initial state shows that `b[3]` was already incremented by 1, so it is now incremented by 1 again, making it incremented by 2 in total. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x, x']`, and `b[3]` is incremented by 2.**
