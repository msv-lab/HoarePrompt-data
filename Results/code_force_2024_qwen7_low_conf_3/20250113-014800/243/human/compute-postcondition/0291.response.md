Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is the final string constructed based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations.** 

Explanation:
- The outer loop runs from `1` to `n+1`.
- Once the outer loop reaches `n+1`, it stops executing.
- The inner loop runs from `1` to `n+1`.
- During each iteration of the inner loop, `nx` is built by appending characters from `xx[i][j-1]` if it is not `?`. Otherwise, it appends either `'S'` or `'F'` based on specific conditions involving the indices `i` and `j` being part of certain lists (`sb[:n//4-1]`).

Since the outer loop runs exactly `n+1` times and the inner loop also runs `n+1` times, `i` will reach `n+1` and the loop will terminate. By the end of the loop, `nx` will contain the final concatenated string formed by the rules specified in the loop.

Given that `sa` and `sb` are updated correctly during the loop to include all relevant indices, and considering the constraints on the loop executions, the final state of the loop is as described above.
