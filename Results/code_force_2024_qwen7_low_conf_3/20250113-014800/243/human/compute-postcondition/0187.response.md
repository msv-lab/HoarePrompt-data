`nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is `k + 2` and `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. So, `nx` is updated to include `xx[i][1]`. The value of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]`, or 'F' or 'S', `i` is `k + 2`, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, and `j` is 2; `nx` includes `xx[k + 2][1]`**
