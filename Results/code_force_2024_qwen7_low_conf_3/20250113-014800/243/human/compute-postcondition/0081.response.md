The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, this means `a[3]` is incremented by 1. Since `a[3]` was initially incremented by 1 in the precondition (making it `a[3] + 1`), incrementing it again by 1 will result in `a[3] + 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x, x']`, and `a[3]` is `a[3] + 2`.**
