`nx` is initially either an empty string concatenated with `xx[i][0]`, or 'F', or 'S'. Given that `i` is `k + 2` and `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, and `j` is 2. The code `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to `nx`.

Therefore, `nx` will now be whatever its initial value was, but with 'S' appended to the end. The specific initial value of `nx` does not change the format of the answer, so we will express it in terms of its initial value plus 'S'.

Output State: **`nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[i][0]` + 'S', or 'F' + 'S', or 'S' + 'S'; `i` is `k + 2`, and `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`; `j` is 2.**
