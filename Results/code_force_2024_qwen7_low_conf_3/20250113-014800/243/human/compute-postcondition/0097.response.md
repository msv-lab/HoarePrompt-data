Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` is a list containing the value 1. If `a[1] > 0` and `b[1] == 0`, then `sa[0]` remains 1. Otherwise, the postcondition does not change from the initial state.***
