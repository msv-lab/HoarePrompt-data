`nx` is assigned an empty string ''. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged because the code snippet only affects `nx`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `k + 2`, `k + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, and `j` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `k + 2`, `k + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, and `j` is `n + 1`.**
