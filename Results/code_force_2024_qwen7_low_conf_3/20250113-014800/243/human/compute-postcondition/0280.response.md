`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `'F'`. Given the initial state, `nx` could be `'S'` or `'F'` depending on certain conditions. After the operation `nx += 'F'`, `nx` will become `'SF'` if it was initially `'S'`, and `'FF'` if it was initially `'F'`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FF'` depending on its initial value.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 2, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FF'`**
