The `print(nx)` statement prints the value of the variable `nx`. However, the value of `nx` is not updated or defined within the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `nx` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is a string constructed based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations, `nx` is the same string as in the initial state**
