Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`. `nx` is updated based on the following conditions:
- If `xx[1][0]` is not `?`, then `nx` is updated by adding `xx[1][0]`.
- If `xx[1][0]` is `?`, then:
  - If `2` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is `'S'`.
  - Otherwise, `nx` is `'F'`.
- Additionally, if `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` remains as previously updated. Otherwise, `nx` is one of `'FF'`, `'SF'`, `'valF'`, or `'?F'` after the if-else block executes.***
