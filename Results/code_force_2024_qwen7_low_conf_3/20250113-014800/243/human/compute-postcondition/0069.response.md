`b[j]` is incremented by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, `b[1]` is incremented by 1. Since `b[1]` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now incremented again. Therefore, `b[1]` will be incremented by 2 from its initial state.

The output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` incremented by 2, `xx` is `['', x, x]`, and `x` is the input string with `x[0] != 'F'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` incremented by 2, `xx` is `['', x, x]`, and `x` is the input string with `x[0] != 'F'**.
