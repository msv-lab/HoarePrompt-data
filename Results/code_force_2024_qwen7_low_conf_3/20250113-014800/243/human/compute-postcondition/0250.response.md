Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is either `'val'` or `'S'` or `'F'`, and `nx` is printed. If `xx[1][n - 1]` is not `?`, then `nx` is `'val'`. If `xx[1][n - 1]` is `?` and either `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is `'F'`.**
