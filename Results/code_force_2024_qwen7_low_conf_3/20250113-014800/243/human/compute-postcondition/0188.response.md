`nx` is initially either an empty string concatenated with `xx[i][0]`, or 'F' or 'S'. `i` is `k + 2`, and `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. `j` is 2. The code `nx += 'F'` appends the string 'F' to `nx`.

Since `nx` could be one of the three initial states ('', 'F', or 'S'), appending 'F' to each would result in the following:
- If `nx` was '', it becomes 'F'.
- If `nx` was 'F', it becomes 'FF'.
- If `nx` was 'S', it becomes 'SF'.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nx` is either 'F', 'FF', or 'SF'; `i` is `k + 2`; `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`; `j` is 2**
