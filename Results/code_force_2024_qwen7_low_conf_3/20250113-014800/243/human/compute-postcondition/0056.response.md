Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 4, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` retains its original value except for `b[4]` which is incremented by 1, and `xx` is `['', x]`. The only change occurs in `b[4]` which is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` (i.e., `x[3]`) is equal to 'S'. Otherwise, `b[4]` remains unchanged.***
