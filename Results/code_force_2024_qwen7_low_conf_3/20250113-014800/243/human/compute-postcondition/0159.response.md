Postcondition: ***`nx` is a string constructed based on the rules described, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` is less than `n + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is extended by `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` ends with 'F' if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` ends with 'S' and has had 'S' appended to it.***
