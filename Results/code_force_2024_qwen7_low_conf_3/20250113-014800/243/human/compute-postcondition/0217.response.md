`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` plus `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the expression `xx[i][j - 1]` is equivalent to `xx[1][0]`. The initial state specifies that the current value of `xx[1][0]` is not '?', so let's denote its value as `val`. Therefore, `nx` is updated to be `nx + val`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 24 inclusive, the current value of `xx[1][0]` is `val`, and `nx` is `nx + val`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 24 inclusive, the current value of `xx[1][0]` is `val`, and `nx` is `nx + val`.**
