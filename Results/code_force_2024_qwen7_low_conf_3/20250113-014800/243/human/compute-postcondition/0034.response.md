Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variable `j` is used in the range `1` to `n + 1`.
2. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[j]` is the count of 'F' at index `j-1` in `x` (or 0 if no 'F' at that position).
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[j]` is the count of 'S' at index `j-1` in `x` (or 0 if no 'S' at that position).
   - `xx` is `['', x]`, where `x` is an input string.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the loop condition `1 <= j <= n + 1` is satisfied for at least one value of `j`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`, the loop will definitely run as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. However, the problem specifies that `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive.
   - Therefore, `n` being within this range ensures that the loop will run at least once.

5. **Initial Values for `i`**:
   - The problem mentions `i` is `i + 1`. This implies that `i` should be an integer such that when incremented, it is valid. However, since `i` itself is not directly used in the loop condition, its initial value doesn't affect the loop execution. 

Given these considerations, the critical states to adjust are:

- `n` must be between 2 and 24 inclusive (as specified).
- `j` will be iterated starting from `1` up to `n + 1`.

Since `n` is already constrained within a valid range, the only thing that needs to be explicitly stated is that `j` will start from `1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` starts from 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x]`, `x` is an input string**
