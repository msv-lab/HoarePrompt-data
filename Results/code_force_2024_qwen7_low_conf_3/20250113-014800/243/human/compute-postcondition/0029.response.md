Postcondition: ***`x` is a list. `b` is a list. If the element at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F', then the value at index `j` of `a` is increased by 1 if `i == j`, otherwise the value at index `j-1` of `a` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', then the value at index `j` of `b` is incremented by 1. There is no change to `a` and `b` otherwise.***
