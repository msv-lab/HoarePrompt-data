Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is either '?' (in the if part) or not '?' (in the else part). Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.***
