The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Based on the previous state, `nx` was being built during the loop iterations, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`.

Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` are not specified, we can only say that `nx` is updated with the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. However, the exact content of `nx` cannot be determined without knowing the exact values.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**State: `i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`, and `nx` is updated with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.**
