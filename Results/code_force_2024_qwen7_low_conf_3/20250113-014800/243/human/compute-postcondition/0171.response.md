Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` remains the same, `k` remains the same. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to append the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the original `nx`. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, then `nx` is updated to `nx` + 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` remains as the original string concatenated with 'S'.**
