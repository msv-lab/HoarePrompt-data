Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the value 1. If `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` is greater than 0, then `sa[0]` remains 1.***

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the condition from the if statement, ensuring that the postcondition reflects the state of the program after entering the if condition.
