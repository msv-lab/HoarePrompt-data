The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` is initially an empty string, appending 'F' to it results in `nx` becoming the string 'F'. The values of the other variables (`i`, `k + 2`, `n + 1`, `j`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition involving `sa`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `k + 2`, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
