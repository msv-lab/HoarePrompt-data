`sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the list `sa` will have the value 1 appended to it. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0; `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` is 0; `sa` is a list containing the value 1**
