The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Since `i` is initially 1, the list `sb` will now contain the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing indices `j` for which `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `sb` is now `[1]`**
