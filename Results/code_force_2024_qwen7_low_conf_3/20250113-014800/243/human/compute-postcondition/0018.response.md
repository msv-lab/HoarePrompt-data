`a[j]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is known from the initial state but the exact value of `j` is not specified. The initial state tells us that `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0 except possibly `a[j]` which could be 1. After incrementing `a[j]`, `a[j]` will now be 2 (if it was 1 before) or 1 (if it was 0 before). All other elements in `a` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables (`b`, `xx`, `x`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0 except `a[j]` which is now 2 (if it was 1) or 1 (if it was 0); `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0; `xx` is `['']`; `x` is an input string.**
