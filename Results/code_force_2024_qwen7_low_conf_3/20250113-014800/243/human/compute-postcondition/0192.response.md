To determine the states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the information provided and follow the logic step by step.

### Initial States:
- `nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]`, or 'F', 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS'.
- `i` is `k + 2` and `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is either 'F', 'FF', or 'SF'.
- Otherwise, `nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]` + 'S', 'F' + 'S', or 'S' + 'S'.
- If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` includes `xx[k + 2][1]`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` starts at 1.
   - `i = k + 2` and `i <= n + 1`.
   - `j` is set to 2 initially (from the given information).

2. **First Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts at 2, the first iteration will not execute because the loop condition is `range(1, n + 1)`, which means it should start from 1 and go up to `n`.

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration, `j` would become 3.
   - The loop will now check the condition `j in range(1, n + 1)`, so `j` should be set to 3.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `j` will be updated to 3.
   - `i` remains unchanged as `k + 2`.
   - `nx` might change based on the conditions given, but since we don't have the specific values of `xx`, `k`, `n`, and `sa`, we cannot determine the exact value of `nx`. However, we know that `nx` will be evaluated based on the conditions mentioned.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `j` is 3.
- `i` is still `k + 2` and `i <= n + 1`.
- `nx` is evaluated based on the conditions given but its exact value is not specified here.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]`, or 'F', 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS'. `i` is `k + 2` and `i <= n + 1`; `j` is 3. If `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is either 'F', 'FF', or 'SF'. Otherwise, `nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]` + 'S', 'F' + 'S', or 'S' + 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` includes `xx[k + 2][1]`.**
