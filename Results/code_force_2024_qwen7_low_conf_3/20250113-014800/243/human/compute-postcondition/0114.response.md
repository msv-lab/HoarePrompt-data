Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the index `1`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, which is 1. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then the condition is met and the lists and variables retain their specified states.***
