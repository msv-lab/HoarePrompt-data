Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[i][0]`, or 'F' or 'S'.
   - `i` is `k + 2`, and `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the concatenation of `nx` with `xx[i][0]`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

2. **Current Values:**
   - From the given information, we know:
     - `i = k + 2`
     - `j = 1`
     - `nx` can be an empty string, 'F', or 'S' depending on the conditions.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `j` being 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - The condition for continuing the loop is `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is currently 1, it needs to be updated to 2 for the next iteration.
   - `i` remains `k + 2` as it does not change within the loop body.
   - The value of `nx` will depend on the condition inside the loop body, but since the loop will continue if `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, we don't need to specify `nx` explicitly here unless additional information is provided.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[i][0]`, or 'F' or 'S'. `i` is `k + 2`, and `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. `j` is 2.**
