The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the function definition. Instead, it processes input data that is implied to be provided through other means (e.g., via command-line arguments, file input, etc.), where the input consists of `n` lines, each containing `n` characters. Each character represents the transition video between two scenarios, described as F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video). Additionally, it is stated that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided, meaning at most \(2 \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) characters are either F or S.

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but based on the context, it could involve determining some characteristic or result related to the input data. However, since the exact output is not specified, we will focus on the input data structure.

Given the structure of the input and the constraints, the functionality can be described as follows:

The functionality of the function `func` is to process an input grid of size \(n \times n\), where each cell contains a character representing a type of transition video or indicates no transition video. The function will handle the predefined constraints on the number of decided transition videos and potentially perform some operation or analysis on this grid.

Functionality: **The function processes an \(n \times n\) grid of characters, where each character represents a transition video between two scenarios (F for funny, S for scary, ? for undecided, and . for no transition video), and ensures at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided.**
