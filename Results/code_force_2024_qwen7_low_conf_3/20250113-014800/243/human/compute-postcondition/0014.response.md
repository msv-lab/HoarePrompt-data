Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `xx` is `['']`, `x` is an input string, and the character at index `j - 1` of `x` is not 'F'. If the character at index `j - 1` of `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` is set to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
