`sb` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 3. The initial value of `i` is 3, so `sb` is updated to contain the values `[1, 2, 2, 3]`. The values of `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 3], `sb` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 2, 3]**
