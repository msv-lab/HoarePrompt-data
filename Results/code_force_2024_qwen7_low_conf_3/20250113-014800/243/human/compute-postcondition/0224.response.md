Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is updated as follows: if `xx[1][0]` is not `?`, then `nx` is `nx + val`. If `xx[1][0]` is `?`, then `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is `nx + 'F'`.**
