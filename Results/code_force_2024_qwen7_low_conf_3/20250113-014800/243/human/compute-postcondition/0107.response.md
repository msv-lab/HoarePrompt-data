Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 3]. If `b[3] > 0` and `a[3] == 0`, then `sa` is updated to contain the value 3. Otherwise, the values in `sa` remain unchanged.***
