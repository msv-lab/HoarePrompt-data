The code assigns an empty string to `nx`. Since no value is explicitly assigned, `nx` is set to an empty string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is '', and `nx` is printed.**
