The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given the initial state where `nx` is a string, the value of `nx` will change to include the character 'F'. The values of `j`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is a string that is now `nx` + 'F', `j` is `n + 1`, `i` remains the same, `k` remains the same.**
