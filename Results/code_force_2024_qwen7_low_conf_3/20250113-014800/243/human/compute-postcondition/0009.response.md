`a[j]` is incremented by 1. Given that `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initially set to 0 except `a[i]` which is 1, and considering that `j` is a valid index within the range of this list (0 to `n`), the value of `a[j]` will be updated. However, the initial value of `a[i]` being 1 does not imply that `j` equals `i`; thus, `a[j]` starts from 0 and gets incremented by 1. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0 except `a[j]` which is now 1, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `xx` is `['']`, `x` is an input string, and the current value of `x[j-1]` is 'F'.**
