The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 3 (as mentioned in the initial state, though it's not explicitly stated here, we can infer it since `i` is used without being defined in the snippet), the value of `a[3]` will be incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x, x']`, and `x` is the input string; `a[3]` is incremented by 1.**
