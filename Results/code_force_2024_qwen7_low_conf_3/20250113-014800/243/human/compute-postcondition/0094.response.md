Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the value 1. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa[0]` remains 1. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition does not change from the if part.***
