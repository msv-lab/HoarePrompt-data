Step-by-step analysis:

1. Initial State:
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is 3
   - `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, depending on `xx[3][2]` and `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`
   - `nx` is either `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1]`, `'FS'`, `'SF'`, or `'FF'`

2. Code Execution:
   - The code updates the variable `nx` by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value.
   - Given `i` is 3 and `j` is 3, `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[3][2]`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `nx` will now hold the value of `nx` (previous value) plus `xx[3][2]`.
   - All other variables (`i`, `j`, `xx[1][n - 1]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 3
- `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, depending on `xx[3][2]` and `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`
- `nx` is now `nx` + `xx[3][2]`

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 3, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, depending on `xx[3][2]` and `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is `nx` + `xx[3][2]`**
