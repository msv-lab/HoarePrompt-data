`nx` is updated by appending the character 'S' to its current string value. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nx` is the string constructed based on the rules described plus 'S', `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, and neither `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.
