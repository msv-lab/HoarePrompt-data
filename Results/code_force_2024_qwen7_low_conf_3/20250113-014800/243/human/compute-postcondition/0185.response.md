Postcondition: ***`nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[i][0]`, or 'F' or 'S'. `i` is `k + 2`, and `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the concatenation of `nx` with `xx[i][0]`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
