Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0 (except possibly `a[j]` which could be 1), `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0 (except `b[j]` which remains 0), `xx` is `['']`, and `x` is an input string. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is set to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the lists `a` and `b`. An IndexError occurred accessing `b[n+1]`.***
