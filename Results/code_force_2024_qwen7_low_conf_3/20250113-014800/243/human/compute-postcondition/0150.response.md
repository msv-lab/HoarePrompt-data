According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` (which is `k + 1` in the initial state) is less than `n + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is the string constructed based on certain rules (though the exact rules are not relevant for this specific task).
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` (`k + 1`) satisfies the condition `i < n + 1`.

Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted such that `k + 1` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`nx` is the string constructed based on the rules described, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`**
