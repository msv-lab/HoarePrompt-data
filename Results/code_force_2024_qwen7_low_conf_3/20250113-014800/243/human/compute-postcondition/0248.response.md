`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus 'F', which means `nx` is now 'F'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `n` must be an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is `?`, `nx` is 'F', and `nx` is printed, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `n` must be an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is `?`, `nx` is 'F', and `nx` is printed, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**
