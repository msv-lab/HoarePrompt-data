Postcondition: ***`nx` is a string. If `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, then `nx` is updated to `nx` + 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` remains as the original string concatenated with 'S'. `j` is `n + 1`, `i` remains the same, and `k` remains the same.***
