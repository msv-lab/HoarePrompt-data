`nx` is a string that is constructed based on certain rules, and it originally ends with a specific character. The variable `i` is set to `k + 1`, where `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`. Also, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`. Additionally, either `i` is within the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is within the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. The code appends the character `'F'` to the string `nx`.

After executing the line `nx += 'F'`, the string `nx` will have the character `'F'` appended to its end. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the string constructed based on the rules described, ending with 'F', `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`. Additionally, either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.**
