Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`. If `xx[1][0]` is not `?`, then `nx` is updated by adding `xx[1][0]`. Otherwise, if `2` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is `'F'`. If `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` remains as previously updated. Otherwise, `nx` is either `'FF'`, `'SF'`, `'valF'`, or `'?F'`.***
