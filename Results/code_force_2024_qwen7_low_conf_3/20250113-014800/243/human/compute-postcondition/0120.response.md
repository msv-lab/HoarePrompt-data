Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is [1, 2, 3], `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, which is 3. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` remains unchanged and `t` is still 3. Since there is no else part, the conditions and lists remain as they are after the if condition is evaluated.***
