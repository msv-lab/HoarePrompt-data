`nx` is initially either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]`, or 'F', 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS'. The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the end of `nx`. This means that `nx` will now include whatever it was before plus 'F'. 

Since `nx` could be any of the specified values or an empty string plus `xx[k + 2][0]` followed by 'S', 'F', or 'S', appending 'F' to each of these possibilities results in:

- If `nx` was an empty string followed by `xx[k + 2][0]` + 'S', it becomes `xx[k + 2][0] + 'SF'`.
- If `nx` was an empty string followed by `xx[k + 2][0]` + 'F', it becomes `xx[k + 2][0] + 'FF'`.
- If `nx` was 'F', 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS', it becomes 'F' + 'F', 'FF' + 'F', 'SF' + 'F', 'FS' + 'F', or 'SS' + 'F', which simplifies to 'FF', 'FFF', 'SFF', 'FSF', or 'SSF'.

Therefore, the new state of `nx` can be one of the following: 'xx[k + 2][0] + 'SF'', 'xx[k + 2][0] + 'FF'', 'FF', 'FFF', 'SFF', 'FSF', or 'SSF'.

Output State: **`nx` is either 'xx[k + 2][0] + 'SF'', 'xx[k + 2][0] + 'FF'', 'FF', 'FFF', 'SFF', 'FSF', or 'SSF'; `i` is `k + 2` and `i <= n + 1`; `j` is 3.**
