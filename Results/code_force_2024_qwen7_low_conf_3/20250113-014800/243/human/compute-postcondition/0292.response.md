Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, then `nx` is constructed according to the specified rules: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, it is directly added to `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, `nx` is appended with `'F'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise it is appended with `'S'`. If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, then `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `nx` is the final string constructed based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations.***
