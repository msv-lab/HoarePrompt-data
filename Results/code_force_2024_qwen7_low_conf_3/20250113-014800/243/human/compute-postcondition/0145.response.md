Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `xx[i][0]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. Otherwise, if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F', and `j` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `nx` is updated by appending `'S'` to its current value.***
