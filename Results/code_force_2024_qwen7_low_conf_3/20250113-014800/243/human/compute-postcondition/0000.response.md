`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input and converts it to an integer type. This integer is within the range of 2 to 24, and it determines the number of lines and characters in the following input. The initial states of the transition videos and the fact that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input value where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios, where F means funny, S means scary, ? means undecided, and . means no transition video (i=j). At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided.**
