Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`, which ranges from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given range in the for loop, `i` should start at 1 and go up to `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 1.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will execute as long as `i` does not exceed `n + 1`.

4. **Identify necessary adjustments**: 
   - The value of `i` must be 1 to start the loop.
   - The value of `n` must be an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, ensuring the loop runs through the required iterations.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states such that `i` is set to 1 and `n` is within the specified range.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive**
