The code `print(nx)` simply prints the value of `nx`. The value of `nx` is determined by the concatenation of the values `xx[2][n - 1], xx[3][n - 1], ..., xx[n][n - 1]` depending on the condition inside the loop, but since no such loop is present in the given code snippet, `nx` remains as it was defined before this line.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`
- `nx` is the concatenation of the values `xx[2][n - 1], xx[3][n - 1], ..., xx[n][n - 1]` (though no loop is present to define this)
- `nx` is printed

Since no loop or conditional logic changes `nx`, the value of `nx` remains as it was defined. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is the concatenation of the values `xx[2][n - 1], xx[3][n - 1], ..., xx[n][n - 1]`, and `nx` is printed.**
