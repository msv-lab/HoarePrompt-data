Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`. If `x[2]` equals 'F', then `a[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[3]` is incremented by 1 if `x[2]` equals 'S'; otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `xx` being `['', x]` and `b[3]` retaining its original value.***
