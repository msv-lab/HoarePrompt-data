`nx` is appended with the character 'F'. The original value of `nx` is a string updated based on the condition for `j = n + 1`, and `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`. After appending 'F', the value of `nx` changes. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the original string updated for `j = n + 1` plus 'F', `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` is less than `n + 1`.**
