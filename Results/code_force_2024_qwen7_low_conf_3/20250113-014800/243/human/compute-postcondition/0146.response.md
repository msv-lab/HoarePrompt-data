Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`, `nx` is a string that has been constructed by following the rules of the loop for all iterations. If the loop executes, `nx` is built by checking `xx[i][j - 1]` for each `j` from 1 to `n`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, `nx` appends `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, `nx` appends `'F'` if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`), otherwise it appends `'S'`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 2 and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'` for all `j`), `nx` remains an empty string.**
