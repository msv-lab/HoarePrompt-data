The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Given that the initial state of `i` is 2, the value of `sb` will be modified.

Since `i` is initially 2, appending `i` to `sb` results in `sb` becoming `[1, 2, 2]`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `sa`) remain unchanged as per the given conditions. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the values [1, 2], `sb` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 2]**.
