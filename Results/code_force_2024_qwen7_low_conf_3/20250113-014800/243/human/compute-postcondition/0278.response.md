`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus `xx[i][j - 1]`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 3 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[3][1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`
- `nx` is either `xx[3][0]` if `xx[3][0]` is not `?`, otherwise `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is `'F'`

Since `i` is 3 and `j` is 2, we need to determine the value of `nx` before adding `xx[3][1]` to it.

Let's consider the conditions for `nx`:
1. If `xx[3][0]` is not `?`, then `nx` is `xx[3][0]`.
2. Otherwise, `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is `'F'`.

Since `i` is 3 and `j` is 2, we don't have information about the exact content of `sb`, but we can infer the following:
- If `xx[3][0]` is not `?`, then `nx` is `xx[3][0]`.
- If `xx[3][0]` is `?`, then we need to check `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.

However, without more information about `sb`, we can assume that `nx` could be either `xx[3][0]` or `'S'` or `'F'`. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the simplest case where `nx` is `xx[3][0]` (if not `?`) or `'S'` (if `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`).

Assuming `xx[3][0]` is not `?`, `nx` would be `xx[3][0]`. Since we don't have the exact value of `xx[3][0]`, we'll keep it as `xx[3][0]`.

After adding `xx[3][1]` to `nx`, the new value of `nx` would be `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1]`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 2
- `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`
- `nx` is now `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1]`

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 2, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1]`**
