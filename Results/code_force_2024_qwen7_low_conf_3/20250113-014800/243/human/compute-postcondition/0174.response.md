Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nx` is the final string constructed based on the rules described.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `k + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `nx` is printed.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment from `k + 1` to `k + 2`.
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`, if `i` is currently `k + 1`, it will be incremented to `k + 2` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `k + 2` in the next iteration.
   - Given that `k + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `k + 2` should also be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `nx` remains the same because the construction of `nx` does not depend on the loop counter `i`.
   - `i` changes from `k + 1` to `k + 2`.
   - `k + 2` must still be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `j` remains `n + 1` because the variable `j` is not modified by the loop and is independent of `i`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nx` is the final string constructed based on the rules described, `i` is `k + 2`, `k + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, and `j` is `n + 1`.**
