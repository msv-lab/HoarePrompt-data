`nx` is a string and its value is extended by the character 'S'. The original value of `nx` was a string, so now it is the original string concatenated with 'S'. The other variables (`j`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the original string concatenated with 'S', `j` is `n + 1`, `i` remains the same, `k` remains the same**
