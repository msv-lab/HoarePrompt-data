The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the string `nx` by appending the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. The values of `j` and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state, and `k` also remains unchanged. The only change is to `nx`, which now includes the additional character from `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with the additional character `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` remains the same, `k` remains the same.**
