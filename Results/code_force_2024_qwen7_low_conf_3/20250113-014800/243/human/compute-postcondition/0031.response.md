`xx.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `xx`. Since `xx` is initially `['']`, appending `x` means that `xx` now contains two elements: the empty string `''` and the string `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and the lengths of the lists `a` and `b` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[j]` is the count of 'F' at index `j-1` in `x` (or 0 if no 'F' at that position), `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[j]` is the count of 'S' at index `j-1` in `x` (or 0 if no 'S' at that position), `xx` is `['', x]`, and `x` is the input string.**
