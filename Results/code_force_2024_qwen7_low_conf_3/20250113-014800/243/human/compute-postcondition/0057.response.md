Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 4, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`. If `x[j - 1]` (i.e., `x[3]`) is 'F', each element in `a` is incremented by 2 (initial increment plus 1). Otherwise, `b[4]` is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', and `a` remains unchanged. `b` retains its original value except for the case where `b[4]` is incremented by 1. `xx` is `['', x]`.***
