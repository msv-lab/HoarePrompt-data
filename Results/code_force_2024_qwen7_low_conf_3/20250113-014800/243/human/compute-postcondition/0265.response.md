Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`.
   - `nx` is the concatenation of the values `xx[2][n - 1], xx[3][n - 1], ..., xx[n][n - 1]`, and `nx` is printed.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop is already in its second iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the last iteration (which is the second iteration), `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - Since the condition `i < n + 1` must hold true, `n` must still satisfy this condition.
   - Hence, `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the last iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `j` remains `n + 1`.
   - `xx[1][n - 1]` remains either `val` or `?`.
   - `nx` will now include an additional value from `xx[3][n - 1]` if it was not already included in the previous iteration.

Based on the above reasoning, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is the concatenation of the values `xx[2][n - 1], xx[3][n - 1], ..., xx[n][n - 1]` including the third element if it wasn't already included, and `nx` is printed.**
