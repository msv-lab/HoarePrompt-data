To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop and its behavior over multiple iterations.

### Loop Analysis

**Loop Code:**
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` starts at 1 and remains 1 throughout the loop because `i` is fixed to 1 in the loop condition.
   - `j` ranges from 1 to `n`.

2. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is updated with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?` and either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is updated with `'S'`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is updated with `'F'`.

3. **Behavior Over Iterations**:
   - The loop will execute exactly `n` times because `j` ranges from 1 to `n`.

### Final Values After All Iterations:
- **i**: Since `i` is fixed to 1, it remains 1.
- **j**: After `n` iterations, `j` will be `n`.
- **n**: Remains the same as the initial value.
- **xx[i][j - 1]**: This is `xx[1][n - 1]`, which is the last element in the first row of `xx`.
- **sb**: The state of `sb` does not change during the loop since `i` is always 1.

### nx Value Calculation:
- `nx` is built up by the loop over all `n` iterations.
- If `xx[1][j - 1]` is not `?`, it contributes directly to `nx`.
- If `xx[1][j - 1]` is `?` and either `1` or `j` (which is within the range `[1, n]`) is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `'S'` is added to `nx`.
- Otherwise, `'F'` is added to `nx`.

### Final Output State:
Given that the loop will execute `n` times and considering the conditions specified:

- `i` will be 1.
- `j` will be `n`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `xx[1][n - 1]` will be the final value contributing to `nx`.

The final value of `nx` will be constructed by iterating through each element of the first row of `xx` and applying the conditions described above.

### Output State:
**Output State:**
``i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is the concatenated string formed by:
- Adding `xx[1][0]` to `nx` if `xx[1][0]` is not `?`.
- Adding `'S'` to `nx` if `xx[1][0]` is `?` and either `1` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `1` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.
- Adding `'F'` to `nx` otherwise.
This process repeats for each `j` from 1 to `n`.**
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is the concatenated string formed by adding elements from `xx[1][0]` to `xx[1][n - 1]` according to the specified conditions.**
