`nx` is originally a string that can be either `'val'`, `'S'`, or `'F'`. The code `nx += 'F'` appends `'F'` to the end of the string `nx`. This means that if `nx` was originally `'val'`, it becomes `'valF'`; if it was `'S'`, it becomes `'SF'`; and if it was `'F'`, it becomes `'FF'`.

The other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, and `xx[1][n - 1]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `j` is `n + 1`; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`; `nx` is either `'valF'`, `'SF'`, or `'FF'`**
