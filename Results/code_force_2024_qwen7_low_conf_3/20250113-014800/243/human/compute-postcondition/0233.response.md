The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the string `'S'` to the existing value of `nx`. Let's analyze the possible states of `nx` based on the initial conditions.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive
   - `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`

2. **Condition to Update `nx`**:
   - If `xx[1][0]` is not `?`, then `nx` is updated by adding `xx[1][0]`.
   - Otherwise, if `2` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is `'S'`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is `'F'`.

Since the code `nx += 'S'` is executed regardless of the conditions mentioned above, the value of `nx` will be updated to include `'S'` at the end. However, we need to consider the initial value of `nx` based on the given conditions.

- If `xx[1][0]` is `val`, then `nx` is initially `val` and becomes `val'S'`.
- If `xx[1][0]` is `?`, then `nx` could be either `'S'` or `'F'`, but the code `nx += 'S'` will append `'S'` to both cases, making `nx` either `'S'S'` or `'FS'`.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `xx[1][0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` is `val'S'` if `xx[1][0]` is `val`, otherwise `nx` is `'S'S'` or `'FS'`.**
