Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0 (except possibly `a[j]` which could be 1), `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `xx` is `['']`, and `x` is an input string. If `x[j-1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is set to 1. If `x[j-1]` is not 'F' and is 'S', then `b[j]` is set to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the lists `a` and `b`.***
