`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus `'F'`. Since `nx` was not previously defined, it is initialized to an empty string before this operation. Therefore, `nx` becomes `'F'` after the assignment. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `xx[1][0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is `'F'`**
