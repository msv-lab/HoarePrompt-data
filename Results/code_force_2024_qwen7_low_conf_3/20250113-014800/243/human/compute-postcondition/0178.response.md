`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` plus `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. Therefore, `nx` is updated to include the character at position `[i][0]` from `xx`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is an empty string + `xx[i][0]`, `i` is `k + 2`, `k + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, `j` is 1**
