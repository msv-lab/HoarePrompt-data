The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, so `xx[i][j - 1]` is `xx[1][2]`. However, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `xx[1][0]` is not `?`, then `nx` is updated by adding `xx[1][2]`.
2. If `xx[1][0]` is `?`, then the value of `nx` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Since the problem does not specify whether `xx[1][0]` is `val` or `?`, we need to consider both possibilities. But for the purpose of updating `nx`, only `xx[1][2]` affects `nx`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive
- `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`
- `nx` is updated by adding `xx[1][2]` if `xx[1][0]` is not `?`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`, `nx` is updated by adding `xx[1][2]` if `xx[1][0]` is not `?`**
