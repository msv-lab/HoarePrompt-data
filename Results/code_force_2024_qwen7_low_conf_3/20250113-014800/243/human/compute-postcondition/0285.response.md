`nx` is initially either `xx[3][0] + xx[3][1]`, `'FS'`, `'SF'`, or `'FF'`. The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character `'S'` to `nx`. Depending on the initial value of `nx`, the updated value will be:

- If `nx` was `'FS'`, it becomes `'FSS'`.
- If `nx` was `'SF'`, it becomes `'SFs'`.
- If `nx` was `'FF'`, it becomes `'FFS'`.

The values of `i`, `j`, `xx[1][n - 1]`, and `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 3, `xx[1][n - 1]` is either `val` or `?`, depending on `xx[3][2]` and `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is either `'FSS'`, `'SFs'`, or `'FFS'`**
