Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1`. `xx` is `['', x, x']`. If `x[2]` is 'F', then `a[3]` is incremented by 1. If `x[2]` is 'S', the condition does not affect the lists. Otherwise, `b[3]` is incremented by 2.***
