The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `nx`, it could be any string. After executing this line of code, `nx` will have the character 'F' appended to its current value.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, `t`, `xx`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `xx[i][0]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F', and `j` remains unchanged.**
