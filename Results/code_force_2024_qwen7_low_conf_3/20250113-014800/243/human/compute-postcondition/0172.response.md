Output State: **`nx` is the final string constructed based on the rules described, `i` is `k + 1`, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` has gone through all iterations of the loop. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to append `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Otherwise, `nx` is updated as follows: if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is the original string updated for `j = n + 1` plus 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original string plus 'S', with `j` = `n` + 1. If the loop does not execute at all (when `k + 1 >= n + 1` initially), then `nx` remains the original value (which is an empty string) and `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.**
