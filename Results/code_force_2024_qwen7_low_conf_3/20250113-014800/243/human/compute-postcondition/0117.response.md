Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the indices `1` and `2`, `sb` is a list containing the indices `j` for which `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, which is 2. If `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0`, `sa` becomes a list containing indices `1` and `2`. Otherwise, `sa` remains as a list containing the index `1`.***
