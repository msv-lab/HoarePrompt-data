Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x, x]`, and `x` is the input string. If `x[1]` is 'F', then `a[2]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `b[2]` is incremented by 2 from its previous value.***
