Output State: **`nx` is a string of length `n`, constructed based on the rules described: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, it is directly added to `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, `nx` is appended with `'F'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise it is appended with `'S'`. `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and the loop does not execute any more iterations since `i` exceeds `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n + 1`.
- After the loop completes its last iteration with `i` set to `n + 1`, the loop condition `i <= n + 1` fails, and no further iterations occur.
- For each iteration, the string `nx` is constructed based on the specified rules involving `xx[i][j - 1]`, `sa`, and `sb`.
- Since the loop completes after `n + 1` iterations (each with a different `i` from `1` to `n + 1`), `nx` will be fully constructed by the end of the loop.
- The variables `i` and `j` will be `n + 1` after the loop, and the loop will not execute any more iterations.
