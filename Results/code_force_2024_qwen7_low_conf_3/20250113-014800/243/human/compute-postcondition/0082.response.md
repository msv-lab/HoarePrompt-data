The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is initialized to 3. Therefore, `b[3]` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is `['', x, x']`, and `b[3]` is incremented by 1.**
