Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive
   - `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`
   - `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[1][0]`:
     - If `xx[1][0]` is not `?`, then `nx` is `nx + val`.
     - If `xx[1][0]` is `?`, then `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is `nx + 'F'`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `j` is currently `1` and it will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `2`.

4. **Checking the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` will be incremented to `2`, we need to check if `j` is within the range specified by the loop (from `1` to `n + 1`).

5. **Determining the New State:**
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged as the loop variable `j` is being incremented.
   - `j` will be `2` in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as well.
   - `xx[1][0]` remains unchanged.
   - `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `j` (which is `2`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is still `1`
- `j` is now `2`
- `n` is still between 2 and 24 inclusive
- `xx[1][0]` is still either `val` or `?`
- `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `j` (`2`), but the exact value of `nx` cannot be determined without the actual values of `sb` and `val`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `j` (`2`).**

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`, and `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `j` (`2`).**
