The code updates `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`. Since `j - 1` results in 1 (because `j` is 2), the value added to `nx` will be `xx[i][1]`. However, since `xx[1][0]` is specified and not `xx[1][1]`, and there's no other information to determine if `xx[1][1]` exists or what its value is, we'll consider the provided value `xx[1][0]`.

Therefore, `nx` is updated by adding `xx[1][0]`, which is either `val` or `?`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is updated by adding `xx[1][0]` (either `val` or `?`), and `xx[1][0]` is either `val` or `?`.**
