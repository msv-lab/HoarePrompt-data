`nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. Given the conditions:

1. `nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]`, or 'F', 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS'.
2. If `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is either 'F', 'FF', or 'SF'.
3. Otherwise, `nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]` + 'S', 'F' + 'S', or 'S' + 'S'.
4. If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` includes `xx[k + 2][1]`.

The value of `nx` is modified by adding `xx[i][j - 1]`. However, since the exact value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not specified, we will consider the possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

- If `nx` was previously 'F', 'FF', or 'SF', then `nx` could become 'F' + `xx[i][j - 1]`, 'FF' + `xx[i][j - 1]`, or 'SF' + `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- If `nx` was previously an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]` + 'S', 'F' + 'S', or 'S' + 'S', then `nx` could become that string followed by `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `nx` depends on its original value and the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific value for `nx`, but we know it will be one of the aforementioned combinations plus the new character.

Output State: **`nx` is either 'F', 'FF', or 'SF', or an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]` + 'S', 'F' + 'S', or 'S' + 'S', followed by `xx[i][j - 1]`**, `i` is `k + 2` and `i <= n + 1`, `j` is 3. If `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is either 'F', 'FF', or 'SF'. Otherwise, `nx` is either an empty string concatenated with `xx[k + 2][0]` + 'S', 'F' + 'S', or 'S' + 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` includes `xx[k + 2][1]`.
