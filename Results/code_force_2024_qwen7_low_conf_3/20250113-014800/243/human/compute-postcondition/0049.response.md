Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b[3]` is incremented by 1 if `x[2]` (since `j-1` gives the index 2) equals 'S'. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `xx` being `['', x]` and `b[3]` retaining its original value.***
