n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. Each character can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video). The diagonal of the matrix will only contain '.', and for each pair (i, j) and (j, i), the characters will be the same. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters will be either F or S.
