Precondition: **n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios, where F means funny, S means scary, ? means undecided, and . means no transition video (i=j). At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided (i.e., at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters are F or S).**
