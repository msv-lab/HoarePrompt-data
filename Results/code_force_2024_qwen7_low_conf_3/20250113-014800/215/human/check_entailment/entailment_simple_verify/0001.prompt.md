You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` must be a positive integer, and the program will process each test case based on the conditions provided within the loop. For each test case, if `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`. Otherwise, if `b - a >= n`, the output is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. If `b - a < n`, the output is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. After processing all test cases, no specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b` will be retained, as they are redefined for each iteration. The final state of the program will be that all test cases have been processed according to the given conditions.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It then checks the conditions to determine the maximum profit:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the profit is simply `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price (`a`) would be the best option.
   - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the best strategy is to sell all buns at the modified price (`b`). The sum of the series from `b` to `1` can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit by splitting the sales between the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price. The formula used is derived from the sum of the series `(b - a)` and the total profit from selling the remaining buns at `a`.

Given the logic and the formulas used in the program, it correctly implements the described strategy for determining the maximum profit. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
