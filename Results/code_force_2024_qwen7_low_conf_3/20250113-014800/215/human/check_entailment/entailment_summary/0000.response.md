Reasoning:  
Let's analyze the given solution step by step to verify its correctness.

1. **Case 1: \(b \leq a\)**

   - According to the problem, if \(b \leq a\), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \(a\).
   - The profit in this case is \(n \times a\).
   - The solution correctly outputs `n * a` when `b <= a`.

2. **Case 2: \(b - a \geq n\)**

   - Here, it is beneficial to sell the first \(k\) buns at the modified price and the remaining \(n-k\) buns at the usual price.
   - The maximum profit is achieved by selling all \(n\) buns at the modified prices, which sum up to \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (b - i + 1)\).
   - This sum can be simplified to \(\frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2}\).
   - The solution correctly outputs `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` when \(b - a \geq n\).

3. **Case 3: \(b - a < n\)**

   - In this case, it is optimal to sell the first \(k\) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - The maximum profit is given by the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + (n - k) \times a\).
   - This simplifies to \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \times a\).
   - The solution correctly outputs `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` when \(b - a < n\).

Given that the solution handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement accurately, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
