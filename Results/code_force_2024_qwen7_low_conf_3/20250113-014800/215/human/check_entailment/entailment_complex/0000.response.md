Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, the program correctly parses the input values `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic for determining the maximum profit is as follows:
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly calculates the total profit as `n * a` since there's no benefit in changing the price.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the program correctly calculates the total profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula represents the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n - 1)`.
   - If `b - a < n`, the program correctly calculates the total profit using the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula also uses the sum of an arithmetic series, adjusted for the number of buns sold at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.
4. The conditions and formulas used are mathematically sound and align with the problem statement.
5. The program handles edge cases and general cases appropriately, ensuring all test cases are processed correctly.

Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
