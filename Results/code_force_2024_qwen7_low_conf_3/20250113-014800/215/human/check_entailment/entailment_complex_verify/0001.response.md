### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks the condition `b <= a`. If true, it prints `n * a`. This is correct because selling all buns at the usual price (`a`) would be the best option if the modified price is not attractive enough.
   - The condition `b - a >= n` checks if the number of buns that can be sold at the modified price is sufficient to cover all buns. If true, the sum of the series from `b` to `1` should be calculated, which is done using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
   - The condition `b - a < n` covers the scenario where fewer buns can be sold at the modified price. The profit is calculated by splitting the sales between the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price. The formula used is derived from the sum of the series `(b - a)` and the total profit from selling the remaining buns at `a`: `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

3. **Arithmetic Series Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` is used to calculate the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `1` when `b - a >= n`. This is mathematically correct as it follows the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is `b` and the last term is `1`.
   - The formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is used to split the sales between the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price. This is also mathematically correct and matches the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, when `b <= a`, it directly prints `n * a`. When `b - a >= n`, it uses the correct sum of the arithmetic series. When `b - a < n`, it uses the correct split calculation.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the described strategy for determining the maximum profit based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
