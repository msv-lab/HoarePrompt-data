The code `print(n * a)` prints the product of `n` and `a`. This does not change the values of the variables, it only prints their values. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, and the product of `n` and `a` is printed.**
