Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input. If `b <= a`, nothing specific is printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is the value of `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. If `b - a` is less than `n`, the printed result is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`***
