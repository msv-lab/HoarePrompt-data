Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output is `n * a`. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. If `b - a` is less than `n`, the output is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`***.
