The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, and `b` is an integer from the input, the output state will reflect that `t` remains greater than 0, while `n`, `a`, and `b` are now assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**
