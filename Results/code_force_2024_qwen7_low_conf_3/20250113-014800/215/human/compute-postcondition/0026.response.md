Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer, and the program will process each test case based on the conditions provided within the loop. For each test case, if `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`. Otherwise, if `b - a >= n`, the output is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. If `b - a < n`, the output is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. After processing all test cases, no specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b` will be retained, as they are redefined for each iteration. The final state of the program will be that all test cases have been processed according to the given conditions.**
