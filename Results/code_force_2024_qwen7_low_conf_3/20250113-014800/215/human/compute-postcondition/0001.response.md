According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, but this alone does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
