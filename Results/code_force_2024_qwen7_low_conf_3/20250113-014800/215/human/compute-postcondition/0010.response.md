Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and `b` is greater than `a`. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. Otherwise, the output is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.***
