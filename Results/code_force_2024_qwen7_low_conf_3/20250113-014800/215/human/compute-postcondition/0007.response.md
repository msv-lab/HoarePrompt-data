The code calculates the value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` and prints it. This calculation updates the output but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

Given the precondition:
- `t` must be greater than 0,
- `n` is an integer from the input,
- `a` is an integer from the input,
- `b` is an integer from the input,
- `b` is greater than `a`,
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

After executing the code, the only change is in the print statement, which outputs the calculated value.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `b` is greater than `a`, and the output is the value of `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`**.
