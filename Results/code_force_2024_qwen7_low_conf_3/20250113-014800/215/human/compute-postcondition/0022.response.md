The code calculates and prints the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. This expression is evaluated and printed, but the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly affected by this operation. The output of the expression is printed, but the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, the output is the value of int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
