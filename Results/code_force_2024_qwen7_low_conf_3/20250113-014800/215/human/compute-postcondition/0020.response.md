The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial conditions are that `t` must be greater than 1, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers from the input. After executing this line of code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated to the integers provided by the user, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input**
