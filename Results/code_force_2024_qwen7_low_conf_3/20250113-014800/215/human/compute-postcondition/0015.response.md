The code prints the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` converted to an integer. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation, but their initial conditions still hold. The value of `n` is used in the calculation, but it is not stored anywhere. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input; the output is the integer value of \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\)**
