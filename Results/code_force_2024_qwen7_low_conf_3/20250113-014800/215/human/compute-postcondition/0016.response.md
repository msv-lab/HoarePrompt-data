The code calculates and prints the value of the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly modified by this code, only `t` is mentioned in the precondition and must be greater than 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are used in the calculation, but their values remain unchanged. The output of the expression is printed, but not stored in a variable.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `a` is an integer from the input
- `b` is an integer from the input

After executing the code, the output is the result of the expression, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, the output is int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)**
