`n, a, b` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which splits the input into three integers. The variable `t` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**
