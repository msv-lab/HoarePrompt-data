The function `func` accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\), where `n` is the number of buns, `a` is the usual price of a bun, and `b` is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output: The function processes `t` test cases, each containing `n`, `a`, and `b`, and returns a result based on the input for each test case. The exact nature of the return value for each test case is not specified in the given information, but it can be inferred that the function likely calculates some value related to the buns and their prices for each test case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `t` and process `t` test cases, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and return a result for each test case based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\)), and returns a result for each test case.**
