The code calculates the value of the expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` and prints it. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are used in this calculation. Since `t` is not involved in the expression, its value remains unchanged. The other variables are used in the calculation, but their values do not change after the expression is evaluated.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` is evaluated.
2. The result of the expression is converted to an integer using `int()`.
3. The result is printed.

Since the value of `t` does not change and the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) are used in the calculation but their values remain the same, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed result of the expression.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, and the printed result is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`**
