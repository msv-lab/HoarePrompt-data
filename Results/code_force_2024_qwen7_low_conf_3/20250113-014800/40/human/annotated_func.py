    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the cumulative sum of the values of `dp[k]` for all `k` where `dp[k] > 0`, and `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`.

    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), and `p`, a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), representing the sorted prefix sums of some hidden array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1. After initializing a dynamic programming array `dp` and setting an `offset` value, the function iterates over a series of updates to `dp`. Specifically, for each element in the range `[1, n]`, it creates a new `dp` array (`new_dp`) based on the current `dp` values, updating each element in `new_dp` by adding the corresponding `dp` values and taking modulo `MOD`. After completing these updates, the function calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + n` and returns `dp[final_sum]`.

This function effectively computes a specific value in the dynamic programming array based on the initial prefix sums provided, performing intermediate updates to the array in a manner that depends on the input values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the value at index `final_sum` in the updated `dp` array, where `final_sum` is derived from the last element of the input list `p` and the given integer `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 indicating the size of the hidden array a for each test case, and p is a list of n integers where |pi| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer equal to the initial value of `int(data[1])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final value of `index + n * t`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop, `res` is unchanged and equal to the last element of `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it reads the input from standard input, extracts the necessary values, and calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute a result. It then stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. If `n` is out of the range 1 to 5000, it should handle this case appropriately, though no specific error message is mentioned in the code. The function assumes that `func_1` is defined elsewhere and correctly handles the parameters passed to it. Edge cases include `n` being exactly 1 or 5000, and `t` being 0 or 1. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input data might be invalid (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or `p`).
