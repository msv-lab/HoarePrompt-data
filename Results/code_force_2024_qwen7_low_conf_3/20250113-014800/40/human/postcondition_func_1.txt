The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it reads the input from standard input, extracts the necessary values, and calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute a result. It then stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. If `n` is out of the range 1 to 5000, it should handle this case appropriately, though no specific error message is mentioned in the code. The function assumes that `func_1` is defined elsewhere and correctly handles the parameters passed to it. Edge cases include `n` being exactly 1 or 5000, and `t` being 0 or 1. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input data might be invalid (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or `p`).
