The code `result = func_1(n, p)` assigns the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`. It also updates the `results` list to include this return value. The function `func_1(n, p)` is called with `n` and `p` as arguments, but since the specifics of the function are not provided, we can only state that `result` is the return value of this function call and `results` now includes this value.

- `t` remains unchanged because it was a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution and the code does not affect `t`.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is the length of the new slice of `data` and the code does not modify `n`.
- `p` remains unchanged because it is a list of `n` integers converted from the new slice of `data` and the code does not modify `p`.
- `data` remains unchanged except for the slice used to create `p` because the code does not modify `data`.
- `index` remains unchanged because the code does not increment or otherwise modify `index`.
- `results` is updated to include the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `result` is set to the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution; `n` is the length of the new slice of `data`; `p` is a list of `n` integers converted from the new slice of `data`; `data` remains unchanged except for the slice used to create `p`; `index` is incremented by `n`; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
