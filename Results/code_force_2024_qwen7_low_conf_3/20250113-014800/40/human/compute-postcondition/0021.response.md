The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (after converting it to an integer) to `n`. Since `t` is defined as a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The value of `n` changes to the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
