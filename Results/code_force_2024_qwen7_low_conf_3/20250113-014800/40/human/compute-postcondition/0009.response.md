The code snippet `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` impacts the following:

1. It slices the `data` list from index `index` to `index + n` and converts each element in this slice to an integer using `map(int, ...)`.
2. The result of this conversion is then converted to a list and assigned to the variable `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer equal to `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.
- `index` is 3.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `p` is being updated, let's assume the slice `data[index:index + n]` contains `n` elements (since `n` is the number of elements to slice).

Let's denote the slice `data[3:3+n]` as `[s1, s2, ..., sn]`, where each `si` is a string. After applying `map(int, ...)` to this slice, the list `p` will contain the integers corresponding to these strings.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0; `p` is updated to a list of integers from the slice `data[3:3+n]`.**
