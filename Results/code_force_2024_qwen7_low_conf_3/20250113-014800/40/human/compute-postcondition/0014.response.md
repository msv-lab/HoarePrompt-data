The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated state:

- `t` is a positive integer equal to `n`.
- `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.
- `index` is incremented by `n` from the previous iteration.
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n`; `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces; `index` is incremented by `n` from the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
