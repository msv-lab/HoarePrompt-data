Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop, `res` is unchanged and equal to the last element of `results`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements of the list `results`.
- Since `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, after the loop completes, `res` will have the value of the last element in `results`.
- The loop itself does not modify the values of `results` or `res`; it only iterates through them.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will be a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `res` will be equal to the last element of `results`.
