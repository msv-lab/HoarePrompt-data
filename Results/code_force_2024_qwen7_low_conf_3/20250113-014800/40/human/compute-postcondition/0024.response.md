The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Based on the initial state, `index` was originally increased by 1 before this line of code. Therefore, after executing `index += n`, the new value of `index` will be its original value plus 1 plus `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1 plus `n`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` over `data[index:index + n]`**
