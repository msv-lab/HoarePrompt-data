The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The initial state indicates that `index` is incremented by `n` from the previous iteration, but this increment does not affect the current operation of `index += 1`. Therefore, the value of `index` simply increases by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n`; `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces; `index` is incremented by 1 from the previous value; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
