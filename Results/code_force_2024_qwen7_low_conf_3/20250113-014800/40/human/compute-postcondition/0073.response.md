`j` is \(2 \times n + 1\). The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). Since `j = 2 \times n + 1`, `j - 1 = 2 \times n`. Given that `dp` and `new_dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements initially, the value of `dp[j]` is the same as `dp[2 \times n + 1]`, which does not exist in the list, so it should be considered as 0. Therefore, the update to `new_dp[j - 1]` is effectively adding 0 to `new_dp[j - 1]`, meaning `new_dp[j - 1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements, `j` is \(2 \times n + 1\), and `new_dp[j - 1]` remains unchanged.**
