The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding the value of `dp[j]` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The variable `j` is equal to `2 * n`, so `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `offset` is equal to `n`
- `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements
- `j` is \(2 * n\)

After executing the line of code, the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated. Since `j` is `2 * n`, `j + 1` is `2 * n + 1`. The updated value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements, `j` is \(2 * n\), `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**
