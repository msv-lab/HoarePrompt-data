`index` is incremented by `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `index` is the original value of `index` plus `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution; `n` is the length of the new slice of `data`; `p` is a list of `n` integers converted from the new slice of `data`; `data` remains unchanged except for the slice used to create `p`; `index` is incremented by `n`; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
