Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements, `j` is \(2 \times n + 1\). If \(j + 1 \leq 2 \times n\), `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
