The code assigns the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is not defined, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we know that `n` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial values, and `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. The other variables (`t`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
