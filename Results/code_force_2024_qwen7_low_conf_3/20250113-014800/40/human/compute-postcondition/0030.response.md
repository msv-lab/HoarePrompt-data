According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least one element, and `res` is unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element, and `res` remains unchanged.

State: **`results` must contain at least one element, `res` is unchanged**
