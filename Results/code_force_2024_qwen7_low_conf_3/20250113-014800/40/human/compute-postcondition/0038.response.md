Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated as described, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated as described, and `j` is the last value it reached before the condition `j + 1 <= 2 * n` failed, assuming the condition `dp[j] > 0` was true. If the condition `dp[j] > 0` was false, then `dp` remains unchanged and `j` is the same as the initial value (which is 0).***
