Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements, `j` is \(2 * n\). If `dp[j] > 0` and `j - 1 >= 0`, then `new_dp[j]` is updated to `(new_dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`. Otherwise, the value of `new_dp[j]` remains unchanged.***
