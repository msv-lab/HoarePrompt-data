Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \(i\) is \(n + 1\)
- \(n\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- \(p\) is a list of \(n\) integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\)
- \(offset\) is equal to \(n\)
- `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated such that `new_dp[j - 1]` is \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD` if `j - 1 <= 2 * n` and `new_dp[j + 1]` is \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`.
- `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated as described.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(2 * n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over the range from 0 to \(2 \times n\). The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and goes up to \(2 \times n\).

### Current State:
- `j` is the current value of the loop variable, which should be updated at the start of each iteration.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be some value \(j_{prev}\) such that \(0 \leq j_{prev} < 2 \times n\).

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be \(j_{prev} + 1\).

### Updated States:
- `i` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
- `p` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
- `offset` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
- `new_dp` and `dp` will be updated within the loop body but their states at the start of the next iteration will depend on the values updated during the loop execution.

### Conclusion:
State at the start of the next iteration of the loop:
- `j` is \(j_{prev} + 1\), where \(0 \leq j_{prev} < 2 \times n\).

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we represent it symbolically as `j_prev + 1`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists updated as per the loop body, `j` is `j_prev + 1` where `0 \leq j_prev < 2 \times n`**.
