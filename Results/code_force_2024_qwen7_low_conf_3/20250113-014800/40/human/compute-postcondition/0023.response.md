`p` is assigned the value of a list obtained by mapping the `int` function over the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n`. The value of `index` is increased by 1, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`. The value of `t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1.

Since the exact values of `data`, `index`, and `n` are not specified, we can only express the final states in terms of these variables. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` over `data[index:index + n]`**
