The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. However, the value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. Since the exact return value of `func_1` is not specified, we can denote it as `result = func_1(n, p)`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
