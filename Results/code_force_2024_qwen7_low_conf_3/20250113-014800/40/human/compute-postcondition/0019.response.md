The code appends the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`) to the list `results`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, or `index`. It only updates the `results` list by adding one more element to it.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution; `n` is the length of the new slice of `data`; `p` is a list of `n` integers converted from the new slice of `data`; `data` remains unchanged except for the slice used to create `p`; `index` is incremented by `n`; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the appended `result`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
