The `index` variable is incremented by 1. The initial state is that `t` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[index])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 indicating the size of the hidden array `a` for each test case, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, and `index` is initially 1. After incrementing `index` by 1, the new value of `index` is 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 indicating the size of the hidden array `a` for each test case, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 2**
