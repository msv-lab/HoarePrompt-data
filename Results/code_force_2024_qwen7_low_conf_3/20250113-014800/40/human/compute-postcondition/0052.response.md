The code `dp = new_dp` assigns the value of the list `new_dp` to the list `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same elements as `new_dp`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element is updated as described in the loop, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`, and `j` is `2 * n + 1`.**
