Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to the initial value of `int(data[1])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final value of `index + n * t`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[1])`.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.
   - `index` starts at 2.
   - `results` is an empty list initially.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `n` is set to the value of `data[index]`.
     - `index` is incremented by `1 + n` (1 for the integer `n` and `n` for the elements in `p`).
     - `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the elements in the slice `data[index:index + n]` to integers.
     - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
     - `result` is appended to `results`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After `t` iterations, `t` remains the same as the initial value because it does not change inside the loop.
   - `n` is the value of `data[index]` just before the last iteration.
   - `p` is the list of integers obtained from the last slice of `data`.
   - `data` remains unchanged except for the slices used to create `p`.
   - `index` is incremented by `n * t` (sum of the lengths of all slices).
   - `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, including the last one.

4. **Special Case:**
   - If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list.
   - In this case, `index` is still 2, and all other variables retain their initial or unchanged values.

This comprehensive state reflects the final values of all variables after the loop completes its execution, considering both the general and special cases.
