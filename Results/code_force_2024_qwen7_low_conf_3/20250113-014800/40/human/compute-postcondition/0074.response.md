Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements, `j` is \(2 \times n + 1\). If \(j - 1 \geq 0\), the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
