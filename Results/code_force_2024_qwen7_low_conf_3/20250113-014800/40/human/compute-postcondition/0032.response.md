According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element at the start of the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` must contain at least one element, and `res` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element. The value of `res` remains unchanged as specified.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`results` must contain at least one element, `res` unchanged**
