The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `index`, `p`, or `result` directly. However, it adds `result` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by `1 + n`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` over `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, and `results` is a list with one additional element, which is the value of `result`.**
