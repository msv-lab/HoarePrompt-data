Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element is updated as described in the loop, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element is updated to `new_dp`, and `j` is `2 * n + 1` (since the loop exits when `j + 1 > 2 * n`).**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` starts at `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a fixed integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(|p[i]| \leq n\).
   - `offset` is equal to `n`.
   - `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) initialized to zero.
   - `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) initialized to zero and set to `new_dp`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs over `j` from `0` to `2 * n`.
   - For each `j` where `dp[j] > 0`, the loop updates `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to them modulo `MOD`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `dp` is updated to `new_dp` because `dp` is set to `new_dp` at the end of the loop.
   - The loop continues updating `new_dp` until `j` reaches `2 * n`, at which point `j + 1` exceeds `2 * n`, causing the loop to exit.
   - Therefore, the final value of `j` is `2 * n + 1`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - All elements in `new_dp` are updated based on the values in `dp` according to the conditions specified in the loop.
   - `dp` is updated to `new_dp` after the loop.
   - `i` remains unchanged at `n + 1`.
   - `p` and `offset` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
   - `j` is `2 * n + 1` since the loop exits when `j + 1 > 2 * n`.
