Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), and `p`, a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), representing the sorted prefix sums of some hidden array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1. After initializing a dynamic programming array `dp` and setting an `offset` value, the function iterates over a series of updates to `dp`. Specifically, for each element in the range `[1, n]`, it creates a new `dp` array (`new_dp`) based on the current `dp` values, updating each element in `new_dp` by adding the corresponding `dp` values and taking modulo `MOD`. After completing these updates, the function calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + n` and returns `dp[final_sum]`.

This function effectively computes a specific value in the dynamic programming array based on the initial prefix sums provided, performing intermediate updates to the array in a manner that depends on the input values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the value at index `final_sum` in the updated `dp` array, where `final_sum` is derived from the last element of the input list `p` and the given integer `n`.**

**Edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `n` is 1, the function will still operate correctly since the loop condition `for i in range(1, n + 1):` ensures that the first iteration handles the case when `n` is 1.
- If `p` contains all zeros (i.e., no 1s or -1s), the `dp` array will not be affected by the prefix sums, and the final result will depend on the initial setup and the value of `final_sum`.
- The function assumes that `MOD` is defined elsewhere in the code, and it is used in the modulo operation during the updates to `new_dp`. If `MOD` is not defined, the function will raise a NameError.**

The function performs these operations without explicitly handling these edge cases within its body, relying on the correct definition of `MOD` and the structure of the input lists.
