Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer equal to `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.
   - `index` is `index + n`.
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - Since `t` is equal to `n` at the start, and assuming no changes to `t` within the loop, `t` remains `n`.
   - Each iteration of the loop processes some part of the data (though the specific operations inside the loop body are omitted).

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating `t` times, and `t` is initially `n`, the loop will execute once for each `n` value.
   - After the first iteration, `t` remains unchanged as the loop condition does not modify `t`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `t` will still be `n`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `t` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration, which is `n`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `p` remains the same.
- `data` remains the same.
- `index` is incremented by `n` after each iteration.
- `results` remains the same.
- `result` remains the same.

Since `t` is equal to `n` and does not change within the loop, and the other variables remain unchanged, the only adjustment needed is for the `index` variable.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer equal to `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.
- `index` is `index + n` (incremented from the previous iteration).
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

So, the final state before the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
