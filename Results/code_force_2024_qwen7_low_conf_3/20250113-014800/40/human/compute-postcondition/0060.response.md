Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with `new_dp[j + 1]` updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`, and `j` is in the range `0` to \(2 \times n - 1`. This update happens if and only if \(j + 1 \leq 2 \times n\). Currently, `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.***
