The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the context provided, it appears the function might handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters `t`, `n`, and `p`. Given the structure of the problem, the function likely receives these parameters through some external mechanism (e.g., from a calling context or an environment where it is invoked).

If we consider the function's behavior described in the output cases:

Case_1: The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case has a value of `n` (the size of the hidden array `a`) and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. If any `n` is outside the range 1 to 5000, the function should return an error message. Otherwise, it processes the list `p`.

Case_2: For each valid test case, the function does not specify a direct return value but implies it might process or return information about the arrays and lists involved.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each with a value of `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. It checks if `n` is within the range 1 to 5000 and processes the list `p` accordingly. If `n` is out of range, it returns an error message.**
