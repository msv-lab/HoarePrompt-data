The code `result = func_1(n, p)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p`. However, the exact values returned by `func_1` are not specified. The only changes to the variables in the current context are:

- `n` remains unchanged.
- `p` remains unchanged.
- `index` is increased by `1 + n`.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `index` is increased by `1 + n`.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` over `data[index:index + n]`.

Since `func_1` is called without its implementation, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `index` has been updated.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by `1 + n`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` over `data[index:index + n]`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.**
