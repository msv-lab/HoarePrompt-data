The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, the exact value of `index` after incrementation cannot be specified without knowing the exact value of `n`. However, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0.**
