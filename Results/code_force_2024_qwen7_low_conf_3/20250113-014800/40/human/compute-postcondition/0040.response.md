The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `i` is initially `n + 1`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `offset` is equal to `n`.
- `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated as described.
- `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated as described.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so it is now `j + 1`.

Therefore, the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated as described, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated as described, and `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**
