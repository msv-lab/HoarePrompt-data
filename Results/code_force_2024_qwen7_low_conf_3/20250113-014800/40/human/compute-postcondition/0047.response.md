Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), `dp` remains unchanged, and `j` is `j_prev + 1`. If \(j + 1 \leq 2 \times n\), the above updates are applied; otherwise, no changes are made.***
