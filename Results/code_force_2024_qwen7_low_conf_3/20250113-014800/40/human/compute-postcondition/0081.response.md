The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers where |p[i]| ≤ n for all 0 ≤ i < n, representing the sorted prefix sums of some hidden array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1. After executing the function body, the function returns `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `p` and return `dp[final_sum]` where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`.
