Let's break down the given information and the requirements of the loop step by step.

### Initial States:
- `t` is a positive integer equal to the initial value of `int(data[1])`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.
- `index` is the final value of `index + n * t`.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop `for res in results:` will iterate over the elements in the `results` list. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Initial Value of `results`:**
   - Since `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty. The loop will only execute if `results` contains at least one element.

2. **State of `res`:**
   - In each iteration, `res` will take the value from `results`. Therefore, the state of `res` will depend on the contents of `results`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, and `result` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution because they do not change within the loop itself (assuming `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` remain constant).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. This ensures that there is at least one value to iterate over.

### Final State:
- `results` must contain at least one element.

Thus, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`results` must contain at least one element**.
