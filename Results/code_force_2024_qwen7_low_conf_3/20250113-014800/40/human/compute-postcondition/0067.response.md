In the given code snippet, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Since `j` is initially set to `2 * n`, `j - 1` becomes `2 * n - 1`. 

The initial state is:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `offset` is equal to `n`
- `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements
- `j` is \(2 * n\)

After executing the line `new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`:
- `new_dp[j - 1]` which is `new_dp[2 * n - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[2 * n - 1] + dp[2 * n]) % MOD`.

Since `dp` and `new_dp` are identical lists initially, `dp[2 * n]` holds the same value as `new_dp[2 * n]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `offset` is equal to `n`
- `new_dp[2 * n - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[2 * n - 1] + new_dp[2 * n]) % MOD`
- `j` is \(2 * n\)

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp[2 * n - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[2 * n - 1] + new_dp[2 * n]) % MOD`, `j` is \(2 * n\)**
