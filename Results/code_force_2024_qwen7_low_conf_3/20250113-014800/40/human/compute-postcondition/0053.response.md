According to the given for loop statement, the loop iterates from `1` to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `offset` is equal to `n`
- `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element is updated as described in the loop
- `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`
- `j` is `2 * n + 1`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the condition for the loop to continue. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to `1` (the starting point of the loop) and `n` remains the same.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be reset to `1`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `p` remains unchanged
- `offset` remains unchanged
- `new_dp` remains unchanged
- `dp` remains unchanged
- `j` remains unchanged

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element is updated as described in the loop, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`, and `j` is \(2 \times n + 1\)**
