The code assigns the value of `p[-1] + offset` to `final_sum`. Given that `offset` is equal to `n`, the value of `final_sum` will be `p[-1] + n`.

- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `p` remains a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `offset` remains equal to `n`.
- `new_dp` remains a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the cumulative sum of the values of `dp[k]` for all `k` where `dp[k] > 0`.
- `dp` remains a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`.

Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `final_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the cumulative sum of the values of `dp[k]` for all `k` where `dp[k] > 0`, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`, `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`.**
