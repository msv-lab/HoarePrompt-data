The code snippet updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Here, `j` is in the range `0` to \(2 \times n - 1\). Since the value of `dp[j]` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than or equal to \(2 \times n - 1\), the new value of `new_dp[j + 1]` will be the old value of `new_dp[j + 1]` plus `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with `new_dp[j + 1]` updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`, and `j` is now in the range `0` to \(2 \times n - 1`.**
