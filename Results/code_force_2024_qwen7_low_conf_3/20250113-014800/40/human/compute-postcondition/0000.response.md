The code `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` variable to `sys.stdin.read`, which means that instead of using the standard `input()` function, we will be using `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. The states of these variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 indicating the size of the hidden array `a` for each test case, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; the `input` variable is now `sys.stdin.read`**.
