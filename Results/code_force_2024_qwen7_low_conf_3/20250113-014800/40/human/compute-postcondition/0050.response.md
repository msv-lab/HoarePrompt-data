Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp[j]` is updated to \((new_dp[j] + dp[j]) \% MOD\) if \(j \geq 0\) and \(j + 1 \leq 2 \times n\), and `dp` remains unchanged. If the condition `dp[j] > 0` is false, no updates are made to `new_dp` and `dp`.***
