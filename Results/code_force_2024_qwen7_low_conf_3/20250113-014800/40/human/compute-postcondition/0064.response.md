Let's break down the problem step by step to understand the required modifications to the program state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `offset` is equal to `n`
- `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements
- `j` is in the range `0` to \(2 \times n - 1\)

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(2 * n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `2 * n - 1`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` is \(2 * n - 1\).

2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `2 * n + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be \(2 * n\).

3. **Other Variables:**
   - Since no other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, `offset`, `new_dp`, `dp`) are modified within the loop (as per the given information), these values remain the same for the next iteration.

### Updated State:
- `i` remains \(1\).
- `n` remains the same integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `p` remains the same list of `n` integers.
- `offset` remains \(n\).
- `new_dp` and `dp` remain lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements.
- `j` is now \(2 * n\).

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements, and `j` is \(2 * n\)**.
