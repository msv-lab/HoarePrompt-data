The code snippet `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts the slice of the `data` list from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers and assigns it to `p`. 

- `p` was previously a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is obtained from `data[index]`, which means `n` is now the length of the new slice of `data`.
- `p` is reassigned to a new list of integers derived from the new slice of `data`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the new value of `p` will be a list of `n` integers (converted from the corresponding slice of `data`) and the value of `index` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution; `n` is the length of the new slice of `data`; `p` is a list of `n` integers converted from the new slice of `data`; `data` remains unchanged except for the slice used to create `p`; `index` is incremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
