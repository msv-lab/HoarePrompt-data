Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements, and `j` is in the range `0` to \(2 \times n - 1`. If `j - 1 \geq 0`, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\).**
