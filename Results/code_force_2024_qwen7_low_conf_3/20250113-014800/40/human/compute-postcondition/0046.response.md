`new_dp[j + 1]` is assigned the value `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Here, `j` is `j_prev + 1` and `MOD` is assumed to be a predefined constant, typically used in modulo operations.

- The value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j]` to it and then taking the modulo with `MOD`.
- The value of `dp[j]` remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` is updated to `j_prev + 1`.
- The value of `j_prev` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, `offset`, and `new_dp` for indices other than `j + 1`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `dp` remains unchanged, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, and `j_prev` remains unchanged.**
