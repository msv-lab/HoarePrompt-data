The code initializes `new_dp` as a list of zeros with a length of \(2 \times n + 1\). This means that each element in `new_dp` is set to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with all elements set to 0, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`, and `j` is \(2 \times n + 1\)**
