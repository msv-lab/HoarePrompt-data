Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated such that `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1 <= 2 * n` and `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`. `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with each element updated as described.***
