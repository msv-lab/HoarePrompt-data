Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the cumulative sum of the values of `dp[k]` for all `k` where `dp[k] > 0`, and `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements as `new_dp`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop since it is used as the upper bound for the outer loop.
- **`p`**: The list `p` also remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`offset`**: The value of `offset` remains `n` because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`new_dp`**: After all iterations of the loop, `new_dp` will hold the cumulative sum of the values of `dp[k]` for all `k` where `dp[k] > 0`. This means that `new_dp[j]` will accumulate the sum of `dp[k]` for all valid `k` that contribute positively to the sum.
- **`dp`**: The `dp` list is updated in each iteration of the outer loop to become `new_dp` after the inner loop completes its execution. Since the loop iterates `n` times, `dp` will eventually hold the final cumulative sums computed by the `new_dp` list.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the `dp` list will contain the cumulative sums of the positive values of the `dp` list from the previous iterations, reflecting the contributions of the prefix sums in `p`.
