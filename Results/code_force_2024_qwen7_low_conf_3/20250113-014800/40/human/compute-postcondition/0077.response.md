The line of code `dp = new_dp` assigns the list `new_dp` to the variable `dp`. This means that `dp` now references the same list that `new_dp` references, but does not create a new list. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp` and `dp` are lists of length \(2 \times n + 1\) holding the same elements, and `j` is \(2 \times n + 1\).**
