`index` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `index` changes. The value of `t` remains the same as it was initially, which is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as it is derived from `data[index]` but the current value of `index` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1**
