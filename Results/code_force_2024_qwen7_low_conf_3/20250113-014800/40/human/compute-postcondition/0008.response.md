The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `index` is 2, so after the increment, `index` will be 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 indicating the size of the hidden array `a` for each test case, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**
