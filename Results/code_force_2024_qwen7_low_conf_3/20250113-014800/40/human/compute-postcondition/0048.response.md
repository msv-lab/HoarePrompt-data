The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). Given the precondition, the value of `j` is `j_prev + 1`. The code checks if \(j + 1 \leq 2 \times n\). If this condition is true, the update is applied. If it is false, no changes are made. Since the condition is true in the given code snippet, the update is applied.

- `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\).
- `dp` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, `offset`, `j_prev`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `offset` is equal to `n`, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), `dp` remains unchanged, and `j` is `j_prev + 1`.**
