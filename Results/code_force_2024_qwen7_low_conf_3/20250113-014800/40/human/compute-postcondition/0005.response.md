The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 indicating the size of the hidden array `a` for each test case, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**
