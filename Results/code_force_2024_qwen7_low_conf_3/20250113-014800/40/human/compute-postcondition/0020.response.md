Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution.
   - `n` is the length of the new slice of `data`.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers converted from the new slice of `data`.
   - `data` remains unchanged except for the slice used to create `p`.
   - `index` is incremented by `n`.
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the appended `result`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `t` iterations. Since `t` is a positive integer and it represents the number of times the loop will run, we need to check if there are still iterations left to run.

3. **State Adjustment:**
   - After each iteration of the loop, `t` should be decremented by 1 because one iteration has completed.
   - `index` is already incremented by `n` after the loop, so it doesn't need to be adjusted within the loop itself.
   - `results` and `result` will be updated inside the loop body, but we need to ensure that `t` is decremented correctly.

Given the initial state, at the start of the loop, `t` is a positive integer, and the loop will run until `t` becomes 0.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` will be decremented by 1 after the first iteration, so it will be `t-1`.
   - `n`, `p`, `data`, and other variables related to the slicing and conversion remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body based on the information given.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1, `n` is the length of the new slice of `data`, `p` is a list of `n` integers converted from the new slice of `data`, `data` remains unchanged except for the slice used to create `p`, `index` is incremented by `n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the appended `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

In simpler terms, the key adjustment is in the value of `t`:

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to `n` before the code execution minus 1**
