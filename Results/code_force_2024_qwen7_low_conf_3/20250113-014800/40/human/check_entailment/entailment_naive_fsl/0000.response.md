Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that would result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Transition Logic**: The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to explore possible transitions between values, but it does not properly handle the constraints of the problem. Specifically, it assumes that each value in the prefix sum array `p` can be formed by either adding or subtracting 1 from the previous value, which is overly simplistic and does not account for the necessary conditions to form valid prefix sums.

2. **Offset Handling**: The variable `offset` is used to shift the DP array, but the logic for transitioning between values (i.e., adding or subtracting 1) is not correctly implemented to ensure that the prefix sums can be formed with the original array `a` consisting only of 1 and -1.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the prefix sum array `p` has specific patterns that cannot be formed by the original array `a`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 0, 1]`
- Expected Output: `0` (There is no valid array `a` that can produce this prefix sum sequence after sorting.)

The provided code will likely return an incorrect result for this case due to its flawed logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
