### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes a DP table `dp` with a size of `2 * n + 1` and sets the offset to `n`. The state `dp[i]` is used to represent the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `i - n`.
   - **DP Transition**: For each position `i` in the prefix sum array `p`, the function updates the DP table to account for the possible prefix sums before and after adding the current element. Specifically, it adds the current value of `dp[j]` to `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` modulo `MOD`.
   - **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + n`, which is the last element in the original unsorted prefix sum array plus the offset. The function returns `dp[final_sum]`, which should give the number of ways to construct the original array `a` that results in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Test Case Processing**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the sorted prefix sum array `p` for each test case.
   - **Result Storage and Output**: It stores the results in a list `results` and prints each result.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
- **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table is initialized properly with an offset of `n`.
- **DP Transition Logic**: The transition logic in `func_1` is correct for simulating the prefix sum construction.
- **Final Sum Calculation**: The calculation of `final_sum` is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
- **Output**: The output is correctly formatted and modulo `998244353` is applied as required.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1`. The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` such that the sorted prefix sum array `p` is produced. The given implementation of `func_1` does not correctly simulate the construction of all possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` does not account for the possibility of having multiple `-1` and `1` values in the array `a` that can lead to the same sorted prefix sum array `p`.

For example, consider the test case `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`. The function should return 3, but the current implementation will likely return a different value because it does not correctly handle the combinatorial aspects of constructing the array `a`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement due to the flaw in the dynamic programming approach in `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
