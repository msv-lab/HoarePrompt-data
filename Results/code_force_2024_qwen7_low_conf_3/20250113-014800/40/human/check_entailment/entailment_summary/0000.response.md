Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to generate a given prefix sum array `p` (after sorting).
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` and iterates through the elements to update the DP array based on the possible transitions from one prefix sum to another.
   - The function returns a value that is supposed to represent the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sums.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums.
   - It then processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The main function `func_2` correctly reads the input and passes the necessary parameters to `func_1`.
   - `func_1` appears to implement a dynamic programming solution to count the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sums, which aligns with the problem statement.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the specified limit.

Given the descriptions and the expected behavior, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. All test cases provided in the problem description are handled by the program without any apparent issues.

Correctness: **True**
