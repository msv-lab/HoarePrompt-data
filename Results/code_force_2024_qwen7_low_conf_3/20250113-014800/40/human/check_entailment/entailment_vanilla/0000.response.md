### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to simulate the construction of the prefix sum array \( p \) before sorting.
   - It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to construct a prefix sum array that matches the given sorted prefix sum array \( p \).
   - The state `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of \( i - n \) (since we start with an offset `n`).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each element in the prefix sum array \( p \), the function updates the DP table to account for adding or subtracting one from the current prefix sum.
   - Specifically, if `dp[j]` is non-zero, it means there are ways to reach a prefix sum of \( j - n \). The next possible prefix sums would be \( j - 1 \) and \( j + 1 \), each contributing to the next state.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The final sum `final_sum` is calculated as \( p[-1] + n \), which corresponds to the last element in the original unsorted prefix sum array.
   - The function returns the value in `dp[final_sum]`, which should give the number of ways to construct the original array \( a \) that results in the given sorted prefix sum array \( p \).

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \), the size of the array \( n \), and the sorted prefix sum array \( p \) for each test case.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles reading input and splitting it into individual test cases.
- **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table is initialized properly with an offset of `n`.
- **DP Transition Logic**: The transition logic in `func_1` is correct for simulating the prefix sum construction.
- **Final Sum Calculation**: The calculation of `final_sum` is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
- **Output**: The output is correctly formatted and modulo \( 998244353 \) is applied as required.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
