The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of strings. Each string contains three space-separated integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. The function processes each test case and calculates the value of `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even and `p3` is not greater than `p1 + p2`. If these conditions are not met, it appends `-1` to the results list. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of results. This list contains either the calculated value or `-1` for each test case based on the specified conditions.
