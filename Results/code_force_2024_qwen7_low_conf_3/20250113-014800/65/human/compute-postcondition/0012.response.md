The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop this statement belongs to. Since no loop is mentioned, and considering the context, we can infer that this might be outside of a loop, which would mean the `continue` statement has no effect and the program continues executing the next line of code.

Given that there is no change in the values of the variables due to the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing `-1`, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 1, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)**
