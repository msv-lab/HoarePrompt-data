According to the code, the loop iterates over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in the `test_cases` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `test_cases` is a list of strings
- `results` contains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`
- `p1` is the first player's score
- `p2` is the second player's score
- `p3` is the third player's score
- `t` is the number of test cases
- `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`
- `i` is 0
- `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the state based on the current values of `i` and `t`. Since `i` is currently 0, it means this is the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

The loop will continue as long as there are more tuples in `test_cases` to process. Since `i` is 0 and `t` is the number of test cases, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `t`.

Here are the updated states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented to 1
- The next tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` from `test_cases` will be processed

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 1, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)**
