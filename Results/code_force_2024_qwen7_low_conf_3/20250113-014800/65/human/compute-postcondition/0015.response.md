The code appends `max_draws` to the `results` list. The value of `max_draws` is given as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Let's represent the updated state:
- `test_cases` remains a list of strings.
- `results` now contains the value of `max_draws`.
- `p1` remains the first player's score.
- `p2` remains the second player's score.
- `p3` remains the third player's score.
- `t` remains the number of test cases.
- `total_points` remains the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `max_draws` remains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 1, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**.
