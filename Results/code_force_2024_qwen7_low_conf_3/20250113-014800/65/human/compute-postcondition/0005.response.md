The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not change any variable values or the state of the program beyond skipping to the next iteration of whatever loop the code was inside. Given that the initial state does not specify which loop the code is part of, the variables `test_cases`, `results`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `i` remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing `-1`, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 0**
