The code updates the value of `total_points` to be the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we know that `total_points` is now their sum. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 1, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)**
