The code initializes `max_draws` by calculating the minimum between `p1` and `p3 - p2`, plus the minimum between `p2` and `p3 - p1`. This does not affect the other variables directly. Let's calculate the value of `max_draws`:

1. `min(p1, p3 - p2)` will take the smaller value between `p1` and `p3 - p2`.
2. `min(p2, p3 - p1)` will take the smaller value between `p2` and `p3 - p1`.

Therefore, `max_draws` is calculated as follows:
- If `p1 <= p3 - p2` and `p2 <= p3 - p1`, then `max_draws = p1 + p2`.
- If `p1 > p3 - p2` and `p2 <= p3 - p1`, then `max_draws = (p3 - p2) + p2 = p3`.
- If `p1 <= p3 - p2` and `p2 > p3 - p1`, then `max_draws = p1 + (p3 - p1) = p3`.
- If `p1 > p3 - p2` and `p2 > p3 - p1`, then `max_draws = (p3 - p2) + (p3 - p1) = 2 * p3 - (p1 + p2)`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not specified, we will represent `max_draws` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` remains unchanged, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 0, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**
