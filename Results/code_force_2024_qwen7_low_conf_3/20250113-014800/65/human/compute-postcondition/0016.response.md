According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `test_cases`. The loop iterates over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `test_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, meaning that only the first tuple in `test_cases` has been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, the current values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` should be updated to the values from the second tuple in `test_cases`.

To determine the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for the second iteration, we would need to know the contents of the `test_cases` list. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that these values will be from the second tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 2, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**
