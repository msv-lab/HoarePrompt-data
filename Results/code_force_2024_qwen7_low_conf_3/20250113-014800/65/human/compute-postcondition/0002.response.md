The code `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3` calculates the sum of the scores of the three players and assigns it to the variable `total_points`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings where each string contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 representing the scores of the three players, and it is guaranteed that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30 and the number of test cases is 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `results` is an empty list, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `i` is 0.**
