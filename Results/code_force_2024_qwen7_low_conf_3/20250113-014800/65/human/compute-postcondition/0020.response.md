Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains either `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` or `-1`, where `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `i` is 2, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. If `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, then `results` is set to `-1`. Otherwise, `results` remains as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.***
