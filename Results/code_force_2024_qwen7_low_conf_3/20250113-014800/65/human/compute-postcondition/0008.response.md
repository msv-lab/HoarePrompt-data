The code appends the value of `max_draws` to the list `results`. From the initial state, `max_draws` is defined as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. The value of `max_draws` does not change, and it is added to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `test_cases` remains a list of strings
- `results` is a list containing the value of `max_draws`
- `p1` remains the first player's score
- `p2` remains the second player's score
- `p3` remains the third player's score
- `t` remains the number of test cases
- `total_points` remains the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`
- `i` remains 0
- `max_draws` remains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 0, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)**
