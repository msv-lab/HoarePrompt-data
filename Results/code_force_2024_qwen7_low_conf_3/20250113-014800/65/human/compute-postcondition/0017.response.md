The code updates the value of `total_points` to be the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Given the initial state, we know that `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, and `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`. The value of `total_points` is calculated as `p1 + p2 + p3`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `i` is 2, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `i` is 2, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**.
