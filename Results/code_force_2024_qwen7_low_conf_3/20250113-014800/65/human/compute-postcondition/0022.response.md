`results.append(max_draws)` appends the value of `max_draws` to the `results` list. The value of `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `i` is 2, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**
