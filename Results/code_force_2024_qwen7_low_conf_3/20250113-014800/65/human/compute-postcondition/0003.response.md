Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of strings where each string contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 representing the scores of the three players, and it is guaranteed that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30 and the number of test cases is 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `results` is an empty list, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `i` is 0. The condition `(total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2)` is true.**
