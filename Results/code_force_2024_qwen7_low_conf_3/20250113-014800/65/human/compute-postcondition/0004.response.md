The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The length of `test_cases` does not affect the outcome since the operation only involves modifying `results`. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `total_points`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing `-1`, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `i` is 0.**
