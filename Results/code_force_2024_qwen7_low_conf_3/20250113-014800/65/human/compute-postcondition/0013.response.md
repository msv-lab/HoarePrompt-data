Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 1, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1). If `total_points` is odd or `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`, then `results` contains `-1`. Otherwise, `results` retains its original value.**
