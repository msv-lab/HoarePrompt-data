State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings where each string contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 representing the scores of the three players, and it is guaranteed that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30 and the number of test cases is 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `results` is an empty list, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, and the index variable `i` is 0.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **List of Test Cases (`test_cases`)**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of strings where each string contains three space-separated integers representing the scores of three players.
   - The number of test cases is guaranteed to be between 1 and 500.

2. **Empty Results List (`results`)**:
   - The `results` list is initially empty.

3. **Loop Variables**:
   - The loop iterates over each string in `test_cases`, unpacking it into `(p1, p2, p3)`.

4. **Initial State for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one test case in `test_cases`.
   - The index variable `i` should start at 0, as the loop will process the first element in the first iteration.

Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute correctly. The critical states are `test_cases` containing at least one valid string, `t` being the number of test cases, and the loop starting with `i` set to 0.

Hence, the final state is as described above.
