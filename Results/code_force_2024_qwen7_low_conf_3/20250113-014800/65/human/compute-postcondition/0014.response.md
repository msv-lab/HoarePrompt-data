The code updates the value of `max_draws` to be the sum of `min(p1, p3 - p2)` and `min(p2, p3 - p1)`. No other variables are affected.

Let's denote the previous values as follows:
- `p1` is the first player's score
- `p2` is the second player's score
- `p3` is the third player's score
- `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`

The updated value of `max_draws` is calculated as:
- `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `t`, `i`, and the condition for `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list, `p1` is the first player's score, `p2` is the second player's score, `p3` is the third player's score, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `i` is 1, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.**
