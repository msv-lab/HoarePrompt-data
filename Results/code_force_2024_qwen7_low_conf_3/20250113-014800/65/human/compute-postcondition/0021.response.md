First, let's identify the relevant variables and their values from the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of strings
- `results` contains either `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` or `-1`
- `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `t` is the number of test cases
- `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`
- `i` is 2
- `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)
```

This line calculates `max_draws` using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.

Since this is the only line of code, no other variables are affected. The value of `max_draws` is now calculated and assigned to itself, so it remains unchanged from its initial state according to the initial conditions.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains either `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` or `-1`, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `i` is 2, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**
