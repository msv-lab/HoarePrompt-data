The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the behavior of `continue` is undefined outside of a loop. Given the lack of loop context, the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` contains `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1), -1`, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `i` is 2, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**
