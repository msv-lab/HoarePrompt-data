Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of draws based on the given problem description and constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. It splits the input string into integers for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even because only even totals can be achieved through the described scoring system (each win contributing 2 points, each draw contributing 2 points).

3. **Consistency Check**: The program ensures that `p3` is not greater than `p1 + p2`. This check ensures that the scores are logically consistent with the described scoring system, where the highest score cannot exceed the sum of the other two scores.

4. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. This formula accounts for the minimum draws that could have occurred while still allowing for the remaining points to be distributed through wins.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program correctly handles invalid cases by appending `-1` to the results list when the total points are odd or `p3` exceeds `p1 + p2`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case as required.

Given the above analysis, the provided program accurately implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints and scoring system.

Correctness: **True**
