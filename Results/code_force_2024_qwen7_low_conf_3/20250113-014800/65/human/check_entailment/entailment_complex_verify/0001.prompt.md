You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of strings, where each string contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 representing the scores of the three players, and it is guaranteed that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30 and the number of test cases is 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in test_cases:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2:
            results.append(-1)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list of `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` for each test case, `p1` is the first player's score for each test case, `p2` is the second player's score for each test case, `p3` is the third player's score for each test case, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each test case, `i` is the index of the last processed test case, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` for the last processed test case.
    return results
    #`The program returns the list of results, which contains the value of min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1) for each test case`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of strings. Each string contains three space-separated integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. The function processes each test case and calculates the value of `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even and `p3` is not greater than `p1 + p2`. If these conditions are not met, it appends `-1` to the results list. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of results. This list contains either the calculated value or `-1` for each test case based on the specified conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case to read the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a list of test cases as input.
   - For each test case, it calculates the total points scored by the three players and checks if the total points are even and if the score of the highest scorer (`p3`) does not exceed the sum of the scores of the other two players.
   - If either condition fails, the function appends `-1` to the results, indicating that the scores are inconsistent.
   - If the conditions are met, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the possibility of draws in the games where the difference in points between the two players is less than or equal to 1.

3. **Output**: The program then prints the results for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each set of scores, or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.
