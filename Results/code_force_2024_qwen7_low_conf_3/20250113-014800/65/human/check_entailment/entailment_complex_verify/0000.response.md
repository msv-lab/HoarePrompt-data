### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. The provided example `1 1 2` illustrates a specific issue where the program's logic fails to capture the correct number of draws.

Let's break down the example step-by-step:

1. **Input:** `1 1 2`
2. **Scores Analysis:**
   - Player 1: 1 point
   - Player 2: 1 point
   - Player 3: 2 points

To achieve these scores, we need to consider different combinations of games and outcomes:

- **Case 1:** Players 1 and 2 play a draw (both get 1 point).
- **Case 2:** Players 2 and 3 play a game where Player 2 wins (Player 2 gets 2 points, Player 3 gets 0 points).

Here, the program calculates:
- `max_draws = min(1, 2 - 1) + min(1, 2 - 1) = 0 + 0 = 0`
- However, the correct number of draws should be `1` (draw between Player 1 and Player 2) + `1` (draw between Player 2 and Player 3) = `2`.

The program fails to account for the fact that the second and third players' win scenario already contributes to the second player's 2 points without needing an additional draw. The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum draws between pairs should be summed, which doesn't capture all possible scenarios.

### Correct Approach:
A more detailed logic is required to ensure all possible scenarios are considered. Here's a revised approach:

1. Calculate the minimum number of draws needed for the first player to reach their score.
2. Adjust the remaining points to be distributed among the second and third players.
3. Ensure the second and third players' scores can be achieved with the remaining points and possibly additional draws.

### Revised Implementation:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((p1, p2, p3))
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in test_cases:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        draws = 0
        # Player 1 needs p1 points, and Player 3 needs p3 - p2 points from Player 2
        # Check if the difference can be achieved with draws and wins
        if p1 <= p2:
            draws += p1
            remaining_points = p3 - p2
            if remaining_points > 0:
                if remaining_points <= p2:
                    draws += remaining_points
                else:
                    draws += p2
                    remaining_points -= p2
                    if remaining_points % 2 == 0:
                        draws += remaining_points // 2
                    else:
                        draws += (remaining_points // 2) + 1
        else:
            draws += p3 - p2
            remaining_points = p1 - p2
            if remaining_points > 0:
                if remaining_points <= p2:
                    draws += remaining_points
                else:
                    draws += p2
                    remaining_points -= p2
                    if remaining_points % 2 == 0:
                        draws += remaining_points // 2
                    else:
                        draws += (remaining_points // 2) + 1
        
        results.append(draws)
    
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately pointed out the flaw in the program, and the revised logic above should address the issue. However, the original assessment was correct, and the program still needs further refinement to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly.
