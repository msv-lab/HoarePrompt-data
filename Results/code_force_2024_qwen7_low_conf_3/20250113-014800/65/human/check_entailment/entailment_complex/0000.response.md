Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` processes each test case to calculate the maximum possible number of draws that could have happened.
2. The key logic in the function involves checking two main conditions:
   - Whether the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even.
   - Whether `p3` is not greater than `p1 + p2`.
3. If both conditions are satisfied, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.
4. If either condition fails, it appends `-1` to the results list.
5. The annotated program correctly initializes and processes the test cases according to the problem description and logic within `func_1`.

Given the problem statement and the implementation of `func_1`, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent. There are no logical errors in the code provided.

Correctness: **True**
