You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((p1, p2, p3))
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of strings, where each string contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 representing the scores of the three players, and it is guaranteed that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30 and the number of test cases is 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in test_cases:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        
        max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)
        
        results.append(max_draws)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `test_cases` is a list of strings, `results` is a list of `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` for each test case, `p1` is the first player's score for each test case, `p2` is the second player's score for each test case, `p3` is the third player's score for each test case, `t` is the number of test cases, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each test case, `i` is the index of the last processed test case, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` for the last processed test case.
    return results
    #`The program returns the list of results, which contains the value of min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1) for each test case`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of strings. Each string contains three space-separated integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. The function processes each test case and calculates the value of `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even and `p3` is not greater than `p1 + p2`. If these conditions are not met, it appends `-1` to the results list. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of results. This list contains either the calculated value or `-1` for each test case based on the specified conditions.
