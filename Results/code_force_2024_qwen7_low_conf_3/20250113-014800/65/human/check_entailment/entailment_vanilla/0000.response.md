Reasoning:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case to read the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a list of test cases as input.
   - For each test case, it calculates the total points scored by the three players and checks if the total points are even and if the score of the highest scorer (`p3`) does not exceed the sum of the scores of the other two players.
   - If either condition fails, the function appends `-1` to the results, indicating that the scores are inconsistent.
   - If the conditions are met, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the possibility of draws in the games where the difference in points between the two players is less than or equal to 1.

3. **Output**: The program then prints the results for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each set of scores, or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

Correctness: **True**
