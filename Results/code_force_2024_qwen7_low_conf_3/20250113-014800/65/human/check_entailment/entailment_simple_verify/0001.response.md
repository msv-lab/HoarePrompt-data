### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step using the given annotations and the example provided.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each test case. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the total points scored by the three players.
   - It then checks two critical conditions:
     1. The total points must be even.
     2. The score of the highest scorer (`p3`) must not exceed the sum of the scores of the other two players (`p1 + p2`).

   - If either of these conditions fails, the function appends `-1` to the results, indicating that the scores are inconsistent.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_draws} = \min(p1, p3 - p2) + \min(p2, p3 - p1)
     \]
   - This formula is designed to account for the possibility of draws in the games where the difference in points between the two players is less than or equal to 1.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, which is consistent with the problem statement.

However, let's examine the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws more closely:

The formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` is intended to count the number of games where a draw could have occurred. But this formula does not correctly handle the scenario where the difference in points between the two players is exactly 2, because in such cases, a draw would not maximize the number of draws. 

For instance, consider the test case `(1, 1, 3)`. According to the formula, the maximum number of draws would be:
\[
\min(1, 3 - 1) + \min(1, 3 - 1) = 1 + 1 = 2
\]
But the actual maximum number of draws in this case is 1, because if there were 2 draws, the scores would be (2, 2, 2), which contradicts the given scores.

Additionally, consider the test case `(1, 1, 10)`. The formula would give:
\[
\min(1, 10 - 1) + \min(1, 10 - 1) = 1 + 1 = 2
\]
But the actual maximum number of draws is 2, as the remaining 8 points can be distributed in such a way that the scores remain (1, 1, 10) with 2 draws.

Thus, the formula is not correctly handling all edge cases, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the provided formula correctly calculates the maximum number of draws. The formula is flawed and leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws.
