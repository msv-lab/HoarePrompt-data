Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of a draw between the first and second player. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 1 2`

According to the problem description, the scores 1, 1, and 2 can be achieved if:
- The first and second player play a draw (each gets 1 point), and
- The second and third player play a game where the second player wins (the second player gets 2 points, and the third player gets 0).

However, the current implementation only considers the minimum draws between pairs and does not account for the possibility of additional draws that might contribute to the final scores. For instance, in the given example, the program would return 2 draws (one between the first and second player and one between the second and third player), which is incorrect because the second and third player winning scenario already accounts for the second player's 2 points without needing an additional draw.

The correct approach should involve more detailed logic to ensure all possible scenarios are considered. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
