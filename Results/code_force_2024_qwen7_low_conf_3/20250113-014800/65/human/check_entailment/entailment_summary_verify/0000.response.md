### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step by step to evaluate its correctness.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three integers `(p1, p2, p3)`.
   - It checks if the total points `p1 + p2 + p3` are even.
   - If the total points are odd or `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`, it appends `-1` to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it calculates `max_draws` using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the results list.

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies that the scores `1 1 2` cannot be achieved without considering additional draws. The correct calculation should be:
     - The first and second players draw (1 point each).
     - The second and third players play a game where the second player wins (2 points for the second player, 0 points for the third player).
     - This results in 1 draw between the first and second players, and no additional draws needed since the second player already has 2 points from the win.
   - The current implementation incorrectly returns 2, but the actual maximum number of draws is 1.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases like `0 0 0` (no games, no draws) and `0 1 1` (one draw).
   - However, it fails to correctly identify cases where additional draws can help achieve the scores, such as the example `1 1 2`.

4. **Correctness of the Implementation:**
   - The current implementation only considers the minimum draws between pairs and does not account for the possibility of additional draws that might contribute to the final scores. This oversight leads to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of additional draws that might help achieve the final scores.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect for some cases, as demonstrated by the example `1 1 2`.
