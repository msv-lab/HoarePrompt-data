Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**: The `input` function reads all data from standard input at once, and `data.split()` splits the data into tokens. This approach ensures that we handle multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function computes the modular inverse using the formula \( \text{pow}(a, p - 2, p) \).
   - This function is correctly implemented for finding the modular inverse of `a` modulo `p`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function handles three distinct cases for `N`:
     - If `N == 1`, it returns `0`.
     - If `N == 2`, it returns `1`.
     - For any other `N`, it returns `714285638`.
   - However, there is a mismatch between the problem statement and the implementation of `func_2`:
     - The problem asks for the value of \(\frac{M}{V}\) which is derived from the pattern of crease lines after folding the square \(N\) times.
     - The provided `func_2` returns constants for different values of `N`, but does not follow the pattern of \(\frac{M}{V}\) as explained in the problem statement.
   - Based on the problem description, the value of \(\frac{M}{V}\) for different `N` should follow a specific pattern involving \(\sqrt{2}\), but the current implementation does not capture this pattern.

Given the discrepancy between the expected behavior of `func_2` and its current implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
