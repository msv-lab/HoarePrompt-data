### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves folding a square piece of paper \(N\) times, with each fold reducing the side length by a factor of \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
   - The crease lines formed during each fold can be categorized into mountains and valleys.
   - The goal is to calculate the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\), where \(M\) is the sum of the lengths of the mountain crease lines and \(V\) is the sum of the lengths of the valley crease lines, expressed in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - After each fold, the number of crease lines increases, and the length of each crease line changes.
   - The length of mountain and valley crease lines follows a specific pattern based on the number of folds.

3. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - **func_1(a, p)**: Computes the modular inverse of `a` modulo `p`, which is necessary for finding \(q^{-1} \mod 999999893\).
   - **func_2(N)**: Returns different values based on `N`:
     - If `N == 1`, it returns `0`.
     - If `N == 2`, it returns `1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `714285638`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, p)**:
     - This function correctly computes the modular inverse, which is essential for the final calculation.
     - It uses the `pow` function with the third argument being the modulus, which is correct for computing modular inverses.
   - **func_2(N)**:
     - For `N = 1`, the output is `0`, which matches the given example.
     - For `N = 2`, the output is `1`, which also matches the given example.
     - However, for \(N > 2\), the function returns `714285638`, which does not reflect the correct pattern of crease line sums. The problem states that for \(N > 2\), the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) should be \(1 - \frac{1}{2^{N-1}}\sqrt{2}\), which is not captured by the constant `714285638`.

5. **Detailed Calculation for \(N > 2\)**:
   - For \(N = 3\):
     - The side length is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
     - The crease lines form a more complex pattern, but the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) can be derived as \(1 - \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{2}\).
     - The function returns `714285638`, which is incorrect.
   - For \(N = 4\):
     - The side length is \(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2^{3/2}}\).
     - The ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) is \(1 - \frac{1}{8}\sqrt{2}\).
     - Again, the function returns `714285638`, which is incorrect.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate \(\frac{M}{V}\) for \(N > 2\). The constant `714285638` is not the correct value for the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) for \(N > 2\).

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all input values.
