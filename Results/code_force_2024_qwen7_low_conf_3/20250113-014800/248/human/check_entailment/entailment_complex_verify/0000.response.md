### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Operations on the Square**: Each operation reduces the side length of the square from \(1\) to \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). After \(N\) operations, the side length of the resulting square is \(\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^N\).
2. **Crease Lines**: The problem involves calculating the sum of lengths of mountain and valley crease lines after \(N\) operations. The crease lines are formed in a specific pattern with each operation.
3. **Ratio Calculation**: We need to find the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) where \(M\) and \(V\) are the sums of lengths of mountain and valley crease lines respectively. This ratio can be expressed as \(A + B\sqrt{2}\), and we need to extract \(B\) and compute its modular inverse.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates \(a^{(p-2)} \mod p\) using the modular exponentiation technique. It is correctly implemented but is not used anywhere in the main logic.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function returns hardcoded values based on the input \(N\):
   - For \(N = 1\), it returns \(0\).
   - For \(N = 2\), it returns \(1\).
   - For \(N > 2\), it returns \(714285638\).

The main part of the code reads input, processes it, and calls `func_2` for each test case. However, `func_2` does not perform any of the necessary calculations to solve the problem. Instead, it returns fixed values which do not depend on the number of operations \(N\).

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not solve the problem as required. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used to compute the necessary values, and the program returns hardcoded values without any logic to handle the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem and instead returns hardcoded values.

**Final: False**
