Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves folding a square piece of paper \(N\) times and calculating the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) after these folds, where \(M\) is the sum of the lengths of the mountain crease lines and \(V\) is the sum of the lengths of the valley crease lines. The result should be expressed in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\), where \(B\) is a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its simplest form, and we need to compute \(p \cdot \text{inv}(q) \mod 999999893\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - After each fold, the square's side length becomes \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
   - The crease lines formed during each fold can be categorized into mountains and valleys.
   - For each fold, the length of mountain and valley crease lines doubles with a factor involving \(\sqrt{2}\).

3. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - **func_1(a, p)**: This function computes the modular inverse of `a` modulo `p`. It is used to find the modular inverse of `q` in the final step.
   - **func_2(N)**: This function returns different values based on `N`:
     - If `N == 1`, it returns `0`.
     - If `N == 2`, it returns `1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `714285638`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - For `N = 1`, the output is `0`, which matches the given example.
   - For `N = 2`, the output is `1`, which also matches the given example.
   - For `N = 3` and higher, the output is `714285638`, which does not match the expected form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\) or the derived values from the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate \(\frac{M}{V}\) for \(N > 2\). The function `714285638` is a constant and does not reflect the expected behavior based on the problem description.
   - Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all input values.

Correctness: **False**
