You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a square piece of paper with a side length equal to 1 unit. In one
operation, you fold each corner of the square to the center of the paper, thus
forming another square with a side length equal to \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} units.
By taking this square as a new square, you do the operation again and repeat
this process a total of N times.

Performing operations for N = 2 .

After performing the set of operations, you open the paper with the same side
up you started with and see some crease lines on it. Every crease line is one
of two types: a mountain or a valley. A mountain is when the paper folds
outward, and a valley is when the paper folds inward.

You calculate the sum of the length of all mountain crease lines on the paper
and call it M . Similarly, you calculate for valley crease lines and call it V
. You want to find the value of \dfrac{M}{V} .

It can be proved that this value can be represented in the form of A +
B\sqrt{2} , where A and B are rational numbers. Let this B be represented as
an irreducible fraction \dfrac{p}{q} , your task is to print p*inv(q) modulo
999\,999\,893 (note the unusual modulo), where inv(q) is the [modular
inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains an integer N (1 \leq N \leq 10^9 ),
the number of operations you perform on the square paper.

Output

For each test case, print on a new line the required answer.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(N):
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    elif N == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return 714285638



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` and returns one of three possible values based on the value of `N`: 0, 1, or 714285638. Specifically, it returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other integer value of `N`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and the annotations accurately reflect the behavior of the code. The function does not have any edge cases beyond the ones explicitly handled within the code.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves folding a square piece of paper \(N\) times and calculating the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) after these folds, where \(M\) is the sum of the lengths of the mountain crease lines and \(V\) is the sum of the lengths of the valley crease lines. The result should be expressed in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\), where \(B\) is a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its simplest form, and we need to compute \(p \cdot \text{inv}(q) \mod 999999893\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - After each fold, the square's side length becomes \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
   - The crease lines formed during each fold can be categorized into mountains and valleys.
   - For each fold, the length of mountain and valley crease lines doubles with a factor involving \(\sqrt{2}\).

3. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - **func_1(a, p)**: This function computes the modular inverse of `a` modulo `p`. It is used to find the modular inverse of `q` in the final step.
   - **func_2(N)**: This function returns different values based on `N`:
     - If `N == 1`, it returns `0`.
     - If `N == 2`, it returns `1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `714285638`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - For `N = 1`, the output is `0`, which matches the given example.
   - For `N = 2`, the output is `1`, which also matches the given example.
   - For `N = 3` and higher, the output is `714285638`, which does not match the expected form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\) or the derived values from the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate \(\frac{M}{V}\) for \(N > 2\). The function `714285638` is a constant and does not reflect the expected behavior based on the problem description.
   - Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all input values.
