Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves folding a square piece of paper multiple times and calculating the ratio of the sum of the lengths of mountain crease lines (`M`) to the sum of the lengths of valley crease lines (`V`). After performing the calculations, the result should be expressed in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\), and we need to find \(B \times \text{inv}(q) \mod 999\,999\,893\).

2. **Given Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, p)**: Computes the modular inverse of `a` modulo `p` using the formula \(a^{p-2} \mod p\). This is a standard method to find the modular inverse.
   - **func_2(N)**: Returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other value of `N`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - From the problem statement, it's clear that the function `func_2(N)` should be returning a value that corresponds to the value of \(B\) from the expression \(A + B\sqrt{2}\).
   - However, based on the given output examples, `func_2(N)` returns 0, 1, or 714285638 for different values of `N`, which doesn't align with the expected behavior. For example:
     - When `N = 1`, the expected value is 0.
     - When `N = 2`, the expected value is 1.
     - When `N = 3`, the expected value is \(714285638\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2(N)` seems to be returning constant values without considering the actual mathematical relationship between `N` and the crease lines' lengths. Therefore, the function is not correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem.

Given the above analysis, the program is not correctly implemented because the function `func_2(N)` does not provide the expected values for different `N` values, which are necessary to compute the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\).

Correctness: **False**
