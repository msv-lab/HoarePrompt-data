You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a square piece of paper with a side length equal to 1 unit. In one
operation, you fold each corner of the square to the center of the paper, thus
forming another square with a side length equal to \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} units.
By taking this square as a new square, you do the operation again and repeat
this process a total of N times.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/412ebba036545f933291dce36c1d7ef46e6051c5.png)
Performing operations for N = 2 .

After performing the set of operations, you open the paper with the same side
up you started with and see some crease lines on it. Every crease line is one
of two types: a mountain or a valley. A mountain is when the paper folds
outward, and a valley is when the paper folds inward.

You calculate the sum of the length of all mountain crease lines on the paper
and call it M . Similarly, you calculate for valley crease lines and call it V
. You want to find the value of \dfrac{M}{V} .

It can be proved that this value can be represented in the form of A +
B\sqrt{2} , where A and B are rational numbers. Let this B be represented as
an irreducible fraction \dfrac{p}{q} , your task is to print p*inv(q) modulo
999\,999\,893 (note the unusual modulo), where inv(q) is the [modular
inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains an integer N (1 \leq N \leq 10^9 ),
the number of operations you perform on the square paper.

Output

For each test case, print on a new line the required answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2
    
    3

Output

    0
    1
    714285638
    
Note

The blue lines in the given figures represent mountain crease lines, and the
green lines represent valley crease lines.

    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:

    if N == 1:
        return 0
    elif N == 2:
        return 1

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
