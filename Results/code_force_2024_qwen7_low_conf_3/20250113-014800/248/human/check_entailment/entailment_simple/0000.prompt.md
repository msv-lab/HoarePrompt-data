You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have a square piece of paper with a side length equal to 1 unit. In one
operation, you fold each corner of the square to the center of the paper, thus
forming another square with a side length equal to \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} units.
By taking this square as a new square, you do the operation again and repeat
this process a total of N times.

Performing operations for N = 2 .

After performing the set of operations, you open the paper with the same side
up you started with and see some crease lines on it. Every crease line is one
of two types: a mountain or a valley. A mountain is when the paper folds
outward, and a valley is when the paper folds inward.

You calculate the sum of the length of all mountain crease lines on the paper
and call it M . Similarly, you calculate for valley crease lines and call it V
. You want to find the value of \dfrac{M}{V} .

It can be proved that this value can be represented in the form of A +
B\sqrt{2} , where A and B are rational numbers. Let this B be represented as
an irreducible fraction \dfrac{p}{q} , your task is to print p*inv(q) modulo
999\,999\,893 (note the unusual modulo), where inv(q) is the [modular
inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains an integer N (1 \leq N \leq 10^9 ),
the number of operations you perform on the square paper.

Output

For each test case, print on a new line the required answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2
    
    3

Output

    0
    1

Note

The blue lines in the given figures represent mountain crease lines, and the
green lines represent valley crease lines.

Crease lines after 1 operation (\dfrac{M}{V} = 0) .| Crease lines after 2
operations (\dfrac{M}{V} = \sqrt{2} - 1) .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

MOD = 999999893
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
results = []
for i in range(1, t + 1):
    N = int(data[i])
    results.append(func_2(N))
for result in results:
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \( \text{pow}(a, p - 2, p) \), where 'a' and 'p' are variables that must be defined with specific values for a concrete result.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_2(N):
    if (N == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        if (N == 2) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            return 714285638
            #The program returns 714285638


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
