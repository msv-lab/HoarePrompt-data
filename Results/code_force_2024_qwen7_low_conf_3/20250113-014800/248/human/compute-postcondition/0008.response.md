Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` and returns one of three possible values based on the value of `N`: 0, 1, or 714285638. Specifically, it returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other integer value of `N`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and the annotations accurately reflect the behavior of the code. The function does not have any edge cases beyond the ones explicitly handled within the code.**

**After the function concludes, the program state is such that it has returned one of the three possible values (0, 1, or 714285638) based on the input `N`. The variable `N` is no longer referenced in the postcondition since it is no longer part of the program state after the function call.**
