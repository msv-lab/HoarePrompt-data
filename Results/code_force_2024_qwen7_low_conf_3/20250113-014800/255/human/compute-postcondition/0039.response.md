`ans[i]` is assigned the value `i - ind`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4. So, `ans[4]` is set to `4 - ind`. The value of `ind` is the minimum of 3 and `ind1`. Since the value of `ind1` is not specified, it remains as `ind1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 3; `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is the minimum of 3 and `ind1`; `i` is 4; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`; `curr` is `pref[4] - 2 * arr[4]`; `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`; `ans[4]` is `4 - ind`.**
