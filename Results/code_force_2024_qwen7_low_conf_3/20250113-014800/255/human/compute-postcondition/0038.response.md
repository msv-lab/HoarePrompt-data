The code `ind = min(ind, ind1)` assigns the minimum value between `ind` and `ind1` to `ind`. Given the initial state, `ind` is 3 and `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`.

Since the exact value of `ind1` depends on the values of `curr` and the list `pref`, which are not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ind` without knowing these values. However, `ind` will be updated to the smaller of its current value (3) and `ind1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 3; `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is the minimum of 3 and `ind1`; `i` is 4; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`; `curr` is `pref[4] - 2 * arr[4]`; `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`.**
