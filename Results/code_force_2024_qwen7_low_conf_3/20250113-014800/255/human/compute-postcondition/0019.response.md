Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`; `i` is `2`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `1 - ind` and all other elements are `10`. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `0` and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`.**
