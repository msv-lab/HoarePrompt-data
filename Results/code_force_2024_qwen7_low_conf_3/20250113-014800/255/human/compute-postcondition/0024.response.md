Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is 2; `i` is 2; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `1 - ind` (which is `-1`) and all other elements are `10`. If `arr[2] < arr[1]`, then `ans[2]` becomes `1`. Otherwise, `ans[2]` remains `-1` (unchanged from the initial state).***
