To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `pref` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `arr`.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 1 and less than `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - Since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Hence, `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts from `i = 1`).

### State Adjustments:
- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` should be set to a value that ensures the loop runs at least once, i.e., `n` must be at least 2.

### Additional Considerations:
- `t`, `arr`, and `pref` do not directly affect the loop execution based on the given conditions. However, `arr` and `pref` must exist and have the correct number of elements to avoid runtime errors during the loop body.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `arr`, `i` is 1**
