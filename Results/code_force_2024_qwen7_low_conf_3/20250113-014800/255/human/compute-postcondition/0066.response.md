The code `ans[i] = 1` updates the value of `ans[i]` to 1. Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `ans[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is one less than its previous value, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` remains unchanged, `ind1` remains unchanged, `ans[i]` is 1, and `t` remains unchanged.**
