The code assigns the value of `i - ind` to `ans[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is `1` and `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`. The value of `ans` is initially a list of length `n` where each element is `10`. After the assignment, the first element of `ans` (at index `1`) will be updated to `1 - ind`.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `1 - ind` and all other elements remain `10`.
- `i` is increased by 1.

Since `i` was `1` and the code increments `i` by `1`, the new value of `i` is `2`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `1 - ind` and all other elements are `10`, `i` is `2`, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`.**
