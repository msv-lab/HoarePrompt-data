The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to the variable `ind`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `pref` is a list of integers
- `ind` is now 3 (previously it was 2)
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`
- `curr` is `pref[3] - 2 * arr[3]`
- `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`
- `ans[3]` is `1`

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list of integers, `ind` is 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`, `curr` is `pref[3] - 2 * arr[3]`, `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`, `ans[3]` is `1`.**
