Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`; `i` is `2`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `1 - ind` and all other elements are `10`.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition is determined solely by the if part. The if condition checks whether `ind` is non-negative and `curr` is greater than 0. If this condition is true, `ans` is modified such that the first element is `1 - ind` and all other elements remain `10`, and `i` is set to `2`. If the condition is false, no changes are made to `ans` and `i` remains `1`, but since the else part does not change these variables, the overall postcondition is as described above.
