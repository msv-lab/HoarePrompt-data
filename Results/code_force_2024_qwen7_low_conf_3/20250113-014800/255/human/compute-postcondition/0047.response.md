Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `pref` is a list of integers.
- `ind` is `n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `i - ind` if `ind` is non-negative and `curr` is greater than `0`, or `1` if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` and `i-1` is valid, otherwise `10`.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n - 1` and decrements until `i` reaches `-1`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n`, the first condition that needs to be checked is whether `i` (which is `n`) is within the valid range.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.
   - Therefore, when `i` becomes `0`, the loop terminates.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to `n` (the initial value), and it must be possible for `i` to decrement and eventually reach `0`.
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse from `n - 1` to `0`, `i` should be set to `n` initially.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be `n`.
- `i` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to start and continue.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `t` remains as `t` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains as `n` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers.
- `ind` is `n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is determined based on the loop iterations.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list of integers, `ind` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is determined based on the loop iterations, `i` must be `n` and greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to start and continue.**
