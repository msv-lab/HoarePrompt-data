The code assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. Since `i` is 2, `ind` is also 2. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is 2; `i` is 2; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `1 - ind` and all other elements are `10`, and `ans[2]` is `1`.**
