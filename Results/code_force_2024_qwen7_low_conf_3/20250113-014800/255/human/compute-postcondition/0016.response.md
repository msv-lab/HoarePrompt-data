Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`; `i` is `1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`; `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`. The current value of `curr` is greater than `0` and the current value of `ind` is greater than or equal to `0`**.
