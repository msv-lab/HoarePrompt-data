The code `pref[i] += pref[i - 1]` increments `pref[i]` by the value of `pref[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, this translates to `pref[3] += pref[2]`. From the initial state, we know `pref[2]` is `2 * pref[1]`. Therefore, `pref[3]` will be updated to `pref[2] + pref[2]`, which simplifies to `4 * pref[1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[1]` remains unchanged, `pref[2]` remains `2 * pref[1]`, `pref[3]` is `4 * pref[1]`, `i` is 3**
