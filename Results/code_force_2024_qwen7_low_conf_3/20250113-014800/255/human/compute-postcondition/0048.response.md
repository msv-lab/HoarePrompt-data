Output State: **`i` is `n`, `curr` is `pref[n] + arr[n] + 1`, `t` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is determined based on the loop iterations.**
