Output State: **`i` is `n`, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `t` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is the maximum index such that `pref[ind]` is the largest prefix sum up to or including `arr[0] + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is either \(-1\) (if the corresponding `ans[i]` was initially \(10^9\)) or the original value, `ind1` is the same as `ind`.**
