Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `curr` is `pref[n] + arr[n] + 1`, `t` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is determined based on the loop iterations, `ind1` is `n`, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i + 1]` (in which case `ans[i]` is 1) or there is no else part (which means the condition `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]` is false).***
