The code sets `ind` to `n`. Initially, `ind` is the minimum of `-1` and the index where `curr` would be inserted in `pref`. Since `ind` is now explicitly set to `n`, this overrides the previous condition.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is `n`; `i` is `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `i - ind` if `ind` is non-negative and `curr` is greater than `0`, or `1` if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` and `i-1` is valid, otherwise `10`.**
