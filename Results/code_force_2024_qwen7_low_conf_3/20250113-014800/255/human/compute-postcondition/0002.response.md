The code creates a new list `pref` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `arr`. This means each element in `pref` is the same as the corresponding element in `arr` up to index `n-1`. The values of `t` and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pref` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `arr`**
