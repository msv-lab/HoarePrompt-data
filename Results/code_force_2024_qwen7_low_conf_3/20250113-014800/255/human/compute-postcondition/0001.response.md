The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in a list called `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
