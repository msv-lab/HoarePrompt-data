The code `pref[i] += pref[i - 1]` updates the value of `pref[i]` by adding the value of `pref[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is initially set to 2, this operation modifies `pref[2]` to be `pref[2] + pref[1]`.

- Before the operation, `pref[2]` is equal to `pref[1]`.
- After the operation, `pref[2]` becomes `pref[1] + pref[1]`, which simplifies to `2 * pref[1]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[1]` remains unchanged, `pref[2]` is now `2 * pref[1]`, `i` is 2**
