The code assigns the value of `ind1` to `ind` if `ind1` is smaller than the current value of `ind`. Since the initial value of `ind` is `-1` and `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`, `ind1` will be a non-negative integer (since the index starts from 0). Given that the initial value of `ind` is `-1`, the assignment will update `ind` to `ind1`.

The output state after the code execution will be:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`; `i` is `1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`; `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`.**
