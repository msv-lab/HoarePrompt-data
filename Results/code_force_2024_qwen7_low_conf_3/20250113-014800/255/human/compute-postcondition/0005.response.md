According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and become 2. Therefore, `n` must still be at least 2 to allow another iteration of the loop.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- The value of `i` needs to be 2.
- `n` must remain at least 2.

The updated state will be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list such that `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[1]` is now `pref[0] + pref[1]`, `pref[2:n]` remains unchanged, `i` is 2**
