`curr` is assigned the value `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, the expression becomes `pref[4] - 2 * arr[4]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list of integers, `ind` is 3, `i` is 4, `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`, `curr` is `pref[4] - 2 * arr[4]`, and `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`.
