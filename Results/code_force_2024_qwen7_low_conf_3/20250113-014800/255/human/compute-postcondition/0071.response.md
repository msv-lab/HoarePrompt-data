The code snippet updates the value of `curr` to `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is one less than its previous value, `curr` is initially defined as `pref[i - 1] + arr[i - 1] + 1`, and now `i` has increased by 1, so the new `curr` is calculated as `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`.

Let's break it down:
- Initially, `curr = pref[i - 1] + arr[i - 1] + 1`.
- After executing `curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, the value of `curr` changes to `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `pref`, `ind`, `ind1`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is one more than its previous value, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is equal to `i - 1`, `ind1` remains unchanged, `ans[i - 1]` is 1 if `arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`, otherwise `ans[i - 1]` retains its previous value (which is the minimum of its current value and `(i - 1) - (i - 1)`) and `t` remains unchanged.**
