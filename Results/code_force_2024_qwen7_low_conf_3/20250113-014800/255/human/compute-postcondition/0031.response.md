The code snippet `ans[i] = 1` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `1`. Given that `i` is `3`, `ans[3]` is set to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 3; `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is 2; `i` is 3; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`; `curr` is `pref[3] - 2 * arr[3]`; `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`; `ans[3]` is `1`.**
