Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list of integers, `ind` is 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`, `curr` is `pref[3] - 2 * arr[3]`, `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`. If `i - 1 >= 0` and `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `ind >= 0` and `curr > 0`, then `ans[3]` is `1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
