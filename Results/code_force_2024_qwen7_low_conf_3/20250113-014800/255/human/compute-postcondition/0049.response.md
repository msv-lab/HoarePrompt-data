The code `ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)` performs a binary search on the `pref` list to find the index of the first element in `pref` that is not less than `curr`. 

- `curr` is defined as `pref[n] + arr[n] + 1`.
- `ind1` is assigned the result of `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`, which returns the index of the first element in `pref` that is not less than `curr`.

Since the exact values of `pref` and `arr` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `ind1` without knowing these lists. However, we know that `ind1` will be an index in the `pref` list such that `pref[ind1]` is the smallest element in `pref` that is not less than `curr`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `curr` is `pref[n] + arr[n] + 1`, `t` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is determined based on the loop iterations, `ind1` is the index of the first element in `pref` that is not less than `curr`.**
