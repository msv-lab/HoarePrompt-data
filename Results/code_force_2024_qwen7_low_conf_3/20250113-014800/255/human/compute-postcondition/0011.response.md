The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, each set to `10 ** 9`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `pref`, `ind`, or `i`. Therefore, the only change is in the `ans` list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list of integers where `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[i]` for \(1 \leq i < n\) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`, `pref[i]` for \(i \geq n\) is equal to `pref[n-1]`, `ind` is `-1`, `i` is `n` if the loop executes `n-1` times, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10 ** 9`**.
