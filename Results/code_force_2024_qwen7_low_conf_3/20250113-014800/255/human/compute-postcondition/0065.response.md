Postcondition: ***`i` is one less than its previous value, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` remains unchanged, `ind1` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated such that `ans[i]` is the minimum of its current value and `ind - i`, and `t` remains unchanged.***
