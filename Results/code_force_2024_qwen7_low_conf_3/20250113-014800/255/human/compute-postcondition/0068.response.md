Postcondition: ***`i` is one less than its previous value, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is equal to `i`, `ind1` remains unchanged, `ans[i]` is 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` retains its previous value (which is the minimum of its current value and `ind - i`), and `t` remains unchanged.***
