The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition (`def func_1():`). However, based on the constraints provided, it implies that the function will internally handle test cases, where for each test case, it accepts `t` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)). Additionally, it is given that the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

Since the function's output is not specified in the problem statement, we can only describe the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` internally, where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).**
