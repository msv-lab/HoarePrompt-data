The code `ans[i] = -1` sets the value of `ans[i]` to -1. Since `i` is 2, the value of `ans[2]` is set to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `t` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is the maximum index such that `pref[ind]` is the largest prefix sum up to or including `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `-1`, `ans[2]` is `-1`, and `ind1` is the same as `ind`.**
