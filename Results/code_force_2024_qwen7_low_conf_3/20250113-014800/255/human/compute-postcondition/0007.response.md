According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`
- `pref[1]` remains unchanged
- `pref[2]` is now `2 * pref[1]`
- `i` is 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.

The other states (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `pref`) do not change within the loop unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, which is omitted here.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` is now 3
- The condition for `n` remains that it is at least 2
- `arr` remains a list of integers
- `pref[0]` remains the first element of `arr`
- `pref[1]` remains unchanged
- `pref[2]` remains `2 * pref[1]`

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[1]` remains unchanged, `pref[2]` remains `2 * pref[1]`, `i` is 3**
