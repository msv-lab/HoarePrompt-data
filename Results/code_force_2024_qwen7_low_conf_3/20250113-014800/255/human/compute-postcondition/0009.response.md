Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list of integers where `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[i]` for \(1 \leq i < n\) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`, `pref[i]` for \(i \geq n\) is equal to `pref[n-1]`, `i` is `n` if the loop executes `n-1` times.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `pref` is initially a list containing the first `n` elements of `arr`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `pref[i]` is updated to `pref[i] + pref[i-1]`. This means `pref[i]` becomes the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `pref[i]` for \(1 \leq i < n\) will be the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`.
   - For \(i \geq n\), `pref[i]` will be equal to `pref[n-1]` because no further updates are made to `pref` beyond the last valid index `n-1`.

4. **Value of `i`**:
   - The loop runs `n-1` times, so `i` will be `n` when the loop exits.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is as described above.
