The code updates `pref[i]` to be the sum of `pref[i]` and `pref[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the line `pref[1] += pref[0]` will execute. Since `pref` contains the first `n` elements of `arr`, `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr` and `pref[1]` is the second element of `arr`. However, without specific values, we can denote the initial state of `pref` as `[a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`, where `a_0` is the first element of `arr`.

After executing the line of code, `pref[1]` will be updated to `pref[1] + pref[0]`. Therefore, the updated `pref` list will be `[a_0, a_0 + a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list such that `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[1]` is now `pref[0] + pref[1]`, `pref[2:n]` remains unchanged, `i` is 1**
