The code updates the variable `curr` with the value of `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`. Given the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `0`.
- `pref[0]` is the first element of the `pref` list.
- `arr[0]` is the first element of the `arr` list.

Therefore, `curr` is calculated as `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` remains a list of integers.
- `pref` remains a list of integers.
- `ind` remains `-1`.
- `i` is updated to `0 + 1 = 1`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is `-1`; `i` is `1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`; `curr` is `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]`.**
