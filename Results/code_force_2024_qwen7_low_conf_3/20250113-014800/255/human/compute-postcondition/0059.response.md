Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `curr` is `pref[n] + arr[n] + 1`, `t` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is determined based on the loop iterations, `ind1` is `n`. If `i + 1 < n` and `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i]` is 1. Otherwise, the condition `i + 1 < n` and `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` is not met.***
