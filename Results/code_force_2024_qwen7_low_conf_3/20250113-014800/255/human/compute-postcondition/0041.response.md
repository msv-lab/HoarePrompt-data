The code snippet `ans[i] = 1` changes the value of `ans[i]` from its original value to `1`. Since `i` is 4, this means `ans[4]` is updated to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 3; `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is the minimum of 3 and `ind1`; `i` is 4; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`; `curr` is `pref[4] - 2 * arr[4]`; `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`; `ans[4]` is `1`.**
