The code `ans[i] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to `ans[i]`. Given the initial state, the value of `ans[i]` is specifically \(10^9\). After this assignment, `ans[i]` will be updated to `-1`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `t` is a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is the maximum index such that `pref[ind]` is the largest prefix sum up to or including `arr[0] + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is determined based on the loop iterations, `ind1` is the same as `ind`, and `ans[i]` is \(-1**.
