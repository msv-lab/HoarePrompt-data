The code sets `ind` to the value of `i`. From the initial state, `i` is 4. Therefore, `ind` is now set to 4.

The output state will include all the initial conditions, updated for the new value of `ind`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 3; `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is 4; `i` is 4; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`; `curr` is `pref[4] - 2 * arr[4]`; `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`; `ans[4]` is `1`.**
