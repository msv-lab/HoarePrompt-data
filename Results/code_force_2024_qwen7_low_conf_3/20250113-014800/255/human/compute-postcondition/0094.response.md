Functionality: **The function processes an input list `arr` of length `n` to generate a list `ans` of the same length. The function computes the prefix sums of `arr` and then iterates through the list to determine the minimum distance to a prefix sum that meets certain conditions. Specifically:

1. It calculates the prefix sums of `arr` and stores them in the list `pref`.
2. It initializes `ans` as a list of `n` elements, each set to a very large number (`10**9`).
3. It performs two passes through the list:
   - The first pass updates `ans` based on the minimum index where a prefix sum minus twice the current element is found in `pref`.
   - The second pass updates `ans` based on the maximum index where a prefix sum plus the current element plus one is found in `pref`.
4. It replaces any remaining `10**9` values in `ans` with `-1`, indicating no valid distance was found.
5. Finally, it prints the `ans` list.

The function accepts a list `arr` and returns a list `ans`. The input `arr` is assumed to be a list of `n` positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). The function ensures that the output list `ans` contains the minimum distances to valid prefix sums under specific conditions, or `-1` if no such distance exists.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `arr` is empty, the function will behave unpredictably due to the list operations.
- If all elements in `arr` are identical, the function may not handle it correctly in the current implementation.
- If the prefix sums do not meet the specified conditions, the output list `ans` will contain `-1` for all elements.

There is no explicit handling for the parameter `t` mentioned in the annotations, which might indicate a misunderstanding or missing part of the function's intended behavior.**
