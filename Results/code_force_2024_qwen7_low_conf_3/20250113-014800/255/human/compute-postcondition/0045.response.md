Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `pref` is a list of integers where `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, and for \(1 \leq i < n\), `pref[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`. For \(i \geq n\), `pref[i]` is equal to `pref[n-1]`.
- `ind` is `-1`
- `i` is `n` initially
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(n):
    curr = pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]
    ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)
    ind = min(ind, ind1)
    if ind >= 0 and curr > 0:
        ans[i] = i - ind
    if i - 1 >= 0 and arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            ind = i
```

### Key Observations
1. **Initialization**: `ind` starts at `-1`, and `i` starts at `n`.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `curr` is calculated as `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`.
   - `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in `pref` if it were sorted.
   - `ind` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `ind1`.
   - If `ind` is non-negative and `curr` is greater than `0`, `ans[i]` is set to `i - ind`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]` and `i-1` is valid, `ans[i]` is set to `1` and `ind` is set to `i`.

### Final State After All Iterations
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- **`arr`**: Remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pref`**: Remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ind`**: The final value of `ind` depends on the values of `pref` and `arr` throughout the iterations. It is set to the minimum of `-1` and the index where `curr` would be inserted in `pref`.
- **`i`**: The final value of `i` is `n` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1` and then increments `i` to `n`.
- **`ans`**: The final state of `ans` will be determined based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `ans[i]` will be either `i - ind` if `ind` is non-negative and `curr` is greater than `0`, or `1` if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` and `i-1` is valid. Otherwise, `ans[i]` will remain `10`.

### Output State
Given the above analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is the minimum of `-1` and the index where `curr` would be inserted in `pref`; `i` is `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `i - ind` if `ind` is non-negative and `curr` is greater than `0`, or `1` if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` and `i-1` is valid, otherwise `10`.**
