`ans[i]` is assigned the value `1`. According to the initial state, `ans[i]` is updated to be `min(ans[i], ind - i)` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`. However, since `ans[i]` is explicitly set to `1`, this condition does not affect the value of `ans[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ind` is the maximum of `i - 1` and `ind1`, `i` is one more than its previous value, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind1` is the index in `pref` where `curr` should be inserted to maintain order, `ans[i - 1]` is 1 if `arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`, otherwise `ans[i - 1]` retains its previous value, `ans[i]` is `1`.
