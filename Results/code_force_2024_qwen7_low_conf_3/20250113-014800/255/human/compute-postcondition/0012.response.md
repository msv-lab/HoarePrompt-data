According to the code and the given conditions, the loop can execute if the following conditions are met:

1. The variable `i` should be within the range `[0, n-1]` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
2. The variable `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to start.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `pref` is a list of integers where `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[i]` for \(1 \leq i < n\) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`, and `pref[i]` for \(i \geq n\) is equal to `pref[n-1]`
- `ind` is `-1`
- `i` is `n` if the loop executes `n-1` times
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`

For the loop to start executing, `i` must be `0` (the smallest value it can take) and `n` must be at least `1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list of integers, `ind` is `-1`, `i` is `0`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`**
