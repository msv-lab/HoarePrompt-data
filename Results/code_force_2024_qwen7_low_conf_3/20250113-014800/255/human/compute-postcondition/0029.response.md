`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `i - ind`. Given the initial values, `i` is 3 and `ind` is 2. Therefore, `ans[3]` is set to `3 - 2`, which equals 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 3; `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is 2; `i` is 3; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`; `curr` is `pref[3] - 2 * arr[3]`; `ans[3]` is 1; `ind1` is the index where `curr` would be inserted in the sorted list `pref`.**
