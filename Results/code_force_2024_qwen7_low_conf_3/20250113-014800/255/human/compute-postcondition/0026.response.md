`curr` is assigned the value of `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`. The value of `i` is 3, so `curr` is calculated as `pref[3] - 2 * arr[3]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 3; `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is 2; `i` is 3; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`; `curr` is `pref[3] - 2 * arr[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 3; `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is 2; `i` is 3; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-1` and all other elements are `10`; `curr` is `pref[3] - 2 * arr[3]`**.
