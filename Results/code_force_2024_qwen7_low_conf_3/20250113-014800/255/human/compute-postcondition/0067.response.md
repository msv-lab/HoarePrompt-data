The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `ind` is now the same as the previous value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is one less than its previous value, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` and `pref` remain as lists of integers, `ind` is equal to `i`, `ind1` remains unchanged, `ans[i]` is 1, and `t` remains unchanged.**
