The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ind`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ind` and retains the preconditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers, `pref` is a list of integers where `pref[0]` is the first element of `arr`, `pref[i]` for \(1 \leq i < n\) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`, `pref[i]` for \(i \geq n\) is equal to `pref[n-1]`, `ind` is `-1`, `i` is `n` if the loop executes `n-1` times.**
