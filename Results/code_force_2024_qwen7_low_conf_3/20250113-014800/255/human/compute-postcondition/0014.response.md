The code `ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)` impacts the program by assigning the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)` to `ind1`. The `bisect.bisect_left` function returns the index of the first occurrence in the sorted list `pref` where the value `curr` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `pref` is a list of integers
- `ind` is `-1`
- `i` is `1`
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`
- `curr` is `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]`

The value of `curr` is specifically `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]`. Therefore, `ind1` will be assigned the index of the first occurrence of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers; `pref` is a list of integers; `ind` is `-1`; `i` is `1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `10`; `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of `pref[0] - 2 * arr[0]` in `pref`.**
