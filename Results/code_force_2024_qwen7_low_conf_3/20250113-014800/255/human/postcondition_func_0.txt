The function processes an input list `arr` of length `n` to generate a list `ans` of the same length. The function computes the prefix sums of `arr` and then iterates through the list to determine the minimum distance to a prefix sum that meets certain conditions. Specifically:

1. It calculates the prefix sums of `arr` and stores them in the list `pref`.
2. It initializes `ans` as a list of `n` elements, each set to a very large number (`10
