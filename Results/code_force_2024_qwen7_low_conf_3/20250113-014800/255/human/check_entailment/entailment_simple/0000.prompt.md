You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
