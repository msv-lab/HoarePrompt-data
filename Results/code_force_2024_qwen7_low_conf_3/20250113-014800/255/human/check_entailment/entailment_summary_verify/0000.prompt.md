You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) â€” the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

        ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)
        ind = min(ind, ind1)
        if ind >= 0 and curr > 0:
            ans[i] = i - ind
        if i - 1 >= 0 and arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:

                ind = i
    ind = n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1
        ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)
        ind = max(ind, ind1)
        if ind < n and curr <= pref[-1]:
            ans[i] = min(ans[i], ind - i)
        if i + 1 < n and arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            if arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i] = 1
                ind = i
    for i in range(n):
        if ans[i] == 10 ** 9:
            ans[i] = -1
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an input list `arr` of length `n` to generate a list `ans` of the same length. The function computes the prefix sums of `arr` and then iterates through the list to determine the minimum distance to a prefix sum that meets certain conditions. Specifically:

1. It calculates the prefix sums of `arr` and stores them in the list `pref`.
2. It initializes `ans` as a list of `n` elements, each set to a very large number (`10

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where a slime can potentially eat both of its neighbors simultaneously, nor does it properly account for the sequence of events where a slime eats one neighbor and then another slime eats it shortly after.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 2 3 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
2 1 1 1
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
2 1 2 1
```

This discrepancy arises because the program does not simulate the sequence of events correctly. In the given example, the third slime can eat the second slime in the first second, and then the first slime can eat the third slime in the next second. However, the program incorrectly calculates the time for the first slime to be eaten as 2 seconds instead of 1.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the process step-by-step and keep track of the sequence of events, rather than just calculating distances based on prefix sums.
