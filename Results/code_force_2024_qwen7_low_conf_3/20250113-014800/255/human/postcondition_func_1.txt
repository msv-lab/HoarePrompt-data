The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of `n` positive integers and an integer `n`. It first constructs two auxiliary lists `left` and `last` to store cumulative sums and indices of the last occurrence of each slime size, respectively. Then, it iterates through the list `a` to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce the size of each slime to a value strictly less than its predecessor (if any). For each slime, it calculates the cumulative sum up to the current index and uses binary search (via `func_1`) to find the last occurrence of a smaller or equal size. If the found index is valid and meets certain conditions, it updates the answer list `ans` with the count of operations needed. The function returns a list `ans` containing the counts of operations for each slime from index 1 to n-1.
