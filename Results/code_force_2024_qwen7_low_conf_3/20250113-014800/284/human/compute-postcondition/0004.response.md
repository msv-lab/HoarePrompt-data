Postcondition: ***`data` is a list of strings, where the first element is the integer value of the original string `n` and the remaining elements are the even integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` as strings; `a` is a list of integers, where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]`. There exists at least one element `ai` in `a` such that `ai` is greater than twice the value of `n` minus one.***
