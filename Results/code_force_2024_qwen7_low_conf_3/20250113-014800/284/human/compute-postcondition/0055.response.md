The code `dist = abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])` calculates the Manhattan distance between two points in a 2D space. The variables `houses[i][0]` and `houses[i][1]` represent the coordinates of one point, while `houses[j][0]` and `houses[j][1]` represent the coordinates of another point. The value of `dist` is the sum of the absolute differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of these two points.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, the value of `dist` is the Manhattan distance between the points `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[j][0], houses[j][1])`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dist` is the Manhattan distance between the points `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[j][0], houses[j][1])`**
