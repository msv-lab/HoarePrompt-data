The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code, the execution effectively ends here. Therefore, the variables `i`, `j`, `dist`, `visits[i]`, and the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`, `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, `dist` is the absolute difference in x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in y-coordinates between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `i != j` is satisfied, and `dist` equals `a[i]`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`.**
