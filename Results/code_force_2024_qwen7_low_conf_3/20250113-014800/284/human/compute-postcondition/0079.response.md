The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block of code. In this case, it does not affect any variables but indicates that the execution has broken out of the loop or block. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j+1` are not equal; `visits[i]` is now `j + 1`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. We break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
