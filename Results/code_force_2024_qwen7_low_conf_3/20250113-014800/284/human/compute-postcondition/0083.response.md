The code calculates the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j][0]` and assigns it to `dist`. However, the condition to update `visits[i]` is not included in the given code snippet. Therefore, only the value of `dist` is updated based on the provided code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j+1` are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j][0]`, and `visits[i]` remains unchanged.**
