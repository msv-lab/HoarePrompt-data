Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States Given:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements.
   - Each element in `data[1:]` is a string representing an even integer and is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]` and each element in `a` is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`.
   - `houses` is a list of length `n` containing the tuples `(x, y)` where `x` is `i + 1` and `y` is `i % n + 1` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `visits` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (which is already given).
   - The loop will iterate `n` times, starting with `j = 0` and ending with `j = n-1`.

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will execute `n` times, we need to ensure that `j` starts at `0` and ends at `n-1`.
   - No additional adjustments are needed for the other variables since their initial states do not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as `n` is a positive integer.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `j` must be 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be a positive integer (already given).

Therefore, the required adjustment is to set `j` to 0.

**State:**
**`j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
