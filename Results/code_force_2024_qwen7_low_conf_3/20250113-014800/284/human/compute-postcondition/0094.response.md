Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements. The first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]` and each element in `a` is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`.
- `houses` is a list of length `n` containing the tuples `(x, y)` where `x` is `i + 1` and `y` is `i % n + 1` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is a positive integer if there exists a `j` such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise, `visits[i]` is `-1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `houses`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the initial conditions and how they impact the loop's execution.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `n` must be a positive integer.
   - `data` must contain at least `n + 1` elements.
   - The first element of `data` should be the integer value of `n`.
   - The remaining elements of `data` must be even integers as strings.

2. **List `a`:**
   - Each element in `a` is an integer derived from the strings in `data[1:]`.
   - Each element in `a` must be less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`.

3. **List `houses`:**
   - `houses` is a list of length `n`.
   - Each element in `houses` is a tuple `(x, y)` where `x = i + 1` and `y = i % n + 1`.

4. **List `visits`:**
   - `visits` is a list of length `n`.
   - Each element in `visits` is determined based on the Manhattan distance between pairs of houses in `houses`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the primary requirement is that `houses` must be a valid list of tuples as described. Given that the loop iterates over each tuple in `houses`, we need to ensure that `houses` is properly initialized and contains the correct tuples.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings, `a` is a list of integers where each element is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`, `houses` is a list of length `n` containing the tuples `(x, y)` where `x = i + 1` and `y = i % n + 1` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `visits` is a list of length `n`**.

This ensures that the loop can proceed and iterate over all the tuples in `houses`.
