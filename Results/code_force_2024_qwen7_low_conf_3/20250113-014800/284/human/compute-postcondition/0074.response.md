Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j` are such that they are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`; if `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`. There is no change in the other variables' states since there is no else part in the code.***
