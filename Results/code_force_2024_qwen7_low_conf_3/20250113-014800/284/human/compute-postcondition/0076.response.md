According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold true:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` and `j` are such that they are not equal.
- `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`.
- If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must increase by 1. Since `j` was previously a valid index (not equal to `i`), it can now take the value `j+1`.

Given that the loop condition is `j < n`, the loop will continue as long as `j+1 < n`.

Since no other variables change within the loop body and the loop only increments `j`, the key adjustments needed are to update `j` to `j+1`. The other conditions remain the same.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and j+1 are such that they are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and houses[j+1]; if `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to (j+1) + 1.**
