Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings; `a` is a list of integers where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]` and each element in `a` is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`, `houses` is a list of length `n` containing the tuples `(x, y)` where `x` is `i + 1` and `y` is `i % n + 1` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is a positive integer if there exists a `j` such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise, `visits[i]` is `-1`. If `-1` is found in `visits`, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints the string representation of the list `visits` separated by spaces.***
