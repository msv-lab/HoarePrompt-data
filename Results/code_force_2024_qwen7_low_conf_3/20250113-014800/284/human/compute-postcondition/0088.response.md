Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n-1`, `visits[i+2]` contains the index `j + 1` where the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`, or `-1` if no such `j` exists; `houses` and `a` remain unchanged, and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`, but excludes the current `i` (`if i != j`).
   - The loop will execute as long as there are valid `j` values that do not equal `i`.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - For each `j`, the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` is calculated.
   - If this distance matches `a[i]`, `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`, and the loop breaks.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - After the loop completes, for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`:
     - `visits[i+2]` will contain the index `j + 1` where the Manhattan distance condition is satisfied, or `-1` if no such `j` exists.
   - The values of `i`, `j`, `dist`, `visits[i]`, and `houses` and `a` remain unchanged outside the loop, except that `visits[i]` is updated if the condition is met.

4. **Special Case: No Valid `j`**:
   - If no valid `j` is found for any `i`, `visits[i+2]` will remain `-1`.

Thus, the final output state reflects the state of all variables after the loop has executed for all valid `i` values.
