The code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points represented by `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but `dist` is assigned the value of the calculated distance.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`**
