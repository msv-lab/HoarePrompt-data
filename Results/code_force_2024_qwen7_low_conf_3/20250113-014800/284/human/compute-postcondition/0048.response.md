The code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` in a 2D space and assigns it to the variable `dist`. Since `i` and `j` are indices into the `houses` list and both points are different (`i != j`), `dist` is assigned the absolute difference in their x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in their y-coordinates.

However, the specific values of `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` are not provided, so we can only say that `dist` is computed based on these coordinates. The variables `i` and `j` remain within their specified ranges, and the condition `i != j` is still satisfied.

Output State: **`i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`, `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, `dist` is the absolute difference in x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in y-coordinates between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, and `i != j` is satisfied.**
