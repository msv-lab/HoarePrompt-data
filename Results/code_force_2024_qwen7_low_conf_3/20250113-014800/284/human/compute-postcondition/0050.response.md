`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given that `i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2` and `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, the value of `visits[i]` will be `j + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`, `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, `dist` is the absolute difference in x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in y-coordinates between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `i != j` is satisfied, and `dist` equals `a[i]`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`.**
