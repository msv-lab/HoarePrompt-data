The code `houses = []` creates an empty list named `houses`. This does not affect the values of `data` or `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `houses` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where the first element is the integer value of the original string `n` and the remaining elements are the even integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` as strings; `a` is a list of integers, where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]`; all elements `ai` in `a` are less than or equal to 2 * (n - 1); `houses` is an empty list**.
