The code calculates the Manhattan distance between two points `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[j][0], houses[j][1])` using the formula `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[i][1])`. Given that `j` is `n`, the distance `dist` is now calculated based on the coordinates of `houses[i]` and `houses[n]`.

The initial state is:
- `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[j][0], houses[j][1])`
- `visits[i]` is unchanged
- `i` is unchanged
- `j` is `n`

After executing the code, `dist` is updated to the new Manhattan distance value.

Output State: **`dist` is the Manhattan distance between `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[n][0], houses[n][1])`, `visits[i]` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `n`**
