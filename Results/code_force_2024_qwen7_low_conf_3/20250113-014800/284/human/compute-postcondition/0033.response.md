`dist` is assigned the value of the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. The Manhattan distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two houses. Since the exact coordinates of `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` are not specified, we use the general form of the calculation. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they must be unequal.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, which is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`, and `i` and `j` must be unequal.**
