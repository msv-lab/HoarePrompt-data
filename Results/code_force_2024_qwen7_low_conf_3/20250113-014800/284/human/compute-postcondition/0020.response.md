The code `houses.append((x, y))` appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `houses`. From the initial state, we know:

- `i` is `x`
- `n` is unchanged
- `data` is unchanged
- `a` is unchanged
- `houses` is updated such that the last tuple is now (`i`, (`i + 1`) % `n` + 1)
- `y` is `x % n + 1`

Since `houses` already had its last tuple updated to (`i`, (`i + 1`) % `n` + 1), appending `(x, y)` will add this new tuple to `houses`.

Given that `i` is `x` and `y` is `x % n + 1`, the new tuple added to `houses` will be `(x, x % n + 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `x`, `n` is unchanged, `data` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `houses` is updated such that the last tuple is now (`i`, (`i + 1`) % `n` + 1) and it also contains (`x`, `x % n + 1`); `y` is `x % n + 1`**
