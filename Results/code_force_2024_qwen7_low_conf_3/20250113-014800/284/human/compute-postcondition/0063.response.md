The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or control structure we are currently inside. However, the given code snippet does not show which loop or structure we are breaking from. Since no changes are made to any variables and the `break` statement itself does not affect any variables, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` is the Manhattan distance between `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[n][0], houses[n][1])`, `visits[i]` is `n + 1`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or control structure.**
