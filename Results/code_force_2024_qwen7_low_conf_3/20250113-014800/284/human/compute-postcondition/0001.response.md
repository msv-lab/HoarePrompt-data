`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`. This means that the input from `sys.stdin.read` is split into a list of strings based on whitespace. The initial integer `n` and the list of even integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` are no longer directly accessible as separate entities but are combined into the `data` list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where the first element is `n` (as a string) and the remaining elements are the even integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` as strings**
