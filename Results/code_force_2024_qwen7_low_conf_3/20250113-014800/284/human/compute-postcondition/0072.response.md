The code assigns the value of `j + 1` to `visits[i]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `dist` remains the same (equal to `a[i]`). The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `j`, and `dist` are preserved.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j` are such that they are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`.**
