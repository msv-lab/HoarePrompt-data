The code `houses.append((x, y))` appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `houses`. From the initial state, we know that `x` is `i - 1` and `y` is `i % n + 1`. Since no new values for `x` and `y` are defined within the code snippet, their values remain unchanged. 

Given this, the last added tuple to `houses` will be `(i - 1, i % n + 1)`. All other variables and lists retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings; `a` is a list of integers where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]` and each element in `a` is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`; `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` where the last added tuple is `(i - 1, i % n + 1); `x` is `i - 1`; `y` is `i % n + 1`.**
