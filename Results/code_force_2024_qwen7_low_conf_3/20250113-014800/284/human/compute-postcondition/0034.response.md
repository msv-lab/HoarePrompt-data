`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is an integer, `j` is set to `j + 1`, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. The code does not affect the value of `dist` or the initial value of `j` (which was `j + 1`). Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `visits[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `visits[i]` is `j + 1`**
