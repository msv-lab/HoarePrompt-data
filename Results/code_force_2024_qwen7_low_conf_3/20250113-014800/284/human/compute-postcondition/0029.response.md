The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but rather exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block containing this `break` statement in the given code snippet, the only change is that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block it was in.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `break` statement is executed, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the implication that the program exits the current loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`; the distance `dist` is equal to `a[i]`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
