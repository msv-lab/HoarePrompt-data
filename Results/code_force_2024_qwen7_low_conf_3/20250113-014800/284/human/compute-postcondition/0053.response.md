Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`, `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, `dist` is the absolute difference in x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in y-coordinates between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. If `i != j` and `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`. If `i != j` is satisfied but `dist` does not equal `a[i]`, the value of `visits[i]` remains unchanged.***
