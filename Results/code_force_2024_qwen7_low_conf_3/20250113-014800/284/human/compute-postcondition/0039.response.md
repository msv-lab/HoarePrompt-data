The code calculates the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` and assigns it to the variable `dist`. The Manhattan distance is computed as the sum of the absolute differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two houses. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition that `j` is less than `n` and `i` and `j` are unequal is preserved.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is less than `n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` (which is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`), and `i` and `j` must be unequal.**
