Postcondition: ***`dist` is the Manhattan distance between the points `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[j][0], houses[j][1])`. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `i != j` is false (meaning `i == j`), no changes occur.***
