The code `a = list(map(int, data[1:]))` takes the list `data` starting from the second element (since `data[1:]` skips the first element) and converts each string element to an integer using the `map` function, then converts the map object to a list.

- `data` is a list where the first element is the integer value of the original string `n`, and the remaining elements are the even integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` as strings.
- After applying `map(int, data[1:])`, the list `a` will contain the integers converted from the strings in `data[1:]`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `data` remains unchanged: the first element is the integer value of the original string `n`, and the remaining elements are the even integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` as strings.
- A new list `a` is created, where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where the first element is the integer value of the original string `n` and the remaining elements are the even integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` as strings; `a` is a list of integers, where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]`.**
