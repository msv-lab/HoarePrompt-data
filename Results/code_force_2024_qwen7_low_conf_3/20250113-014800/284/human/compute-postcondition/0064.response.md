Postcondition: ***`dist` is the Manhattan distance between `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[n][0], houses[n][1])`, `visits[i]` is either unchanged or `n + 1`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `n`. If `dist == a[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or control structure. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
