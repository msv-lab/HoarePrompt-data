Postcondition: **`i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`, `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, `dist` is the absolute difference in x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in y-coordinates between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, and `i != j` is satisfied. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`.**
