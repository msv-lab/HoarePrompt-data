Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j+1` are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `j + 2`. Otherwise, the values of `visits[i]` and `dist` remain unchanged.***

This postcondition captures the behavior of both the if and else parts, ensuring that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition and accurately reflects the possible outcomes after the execution of the if-else block.
