The code assigns the value of `j + 1` to `visits[i]`. This changes the value of `visits[i]` from its original unspecified but constant value (since `visits[i]` remains unchanged in the precondition) to `j + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `dist`, and `houses`) remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j+1` are not equal; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j][0]`**
