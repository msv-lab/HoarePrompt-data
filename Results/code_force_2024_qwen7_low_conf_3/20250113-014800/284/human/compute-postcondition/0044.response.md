Output State: **`i` is an integer ranging from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is an integer ranging from 0 to `n-1` excluding `i`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1` if there exists a `j` such that `dist` equals `a[i]`, otherwise, `visits[i]` remains `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each index `j` from `0` to `n-1` while ensuring `i` and `j` are not equal.
- For each `i`, it checks if the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`.
- If the condition is met, `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`, and the loop exits.
- After all iterations, `visits[i]` will be `j + 1` if a matching `j` was found for each `i`, otherwise, it will remain `-1`.

Since the loop will iterate over all possible `j` values for each `i`, the final state will reflect whether a valid `j` was found for each `i` based on the given conditions.
