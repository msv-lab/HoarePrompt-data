Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is less than `n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, and `i` and `j` must be unequal. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is `j + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `dist`, and `visits` remain as they were before the if statement.***
