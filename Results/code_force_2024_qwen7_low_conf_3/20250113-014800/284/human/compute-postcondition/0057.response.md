The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables but rather exits the loop or the most internal loop or structure we are inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional structure directly mentioned in the code snippet, the only thing affected is that we exit the most internal loop or structure.

Output State: **`dist` is the Manhattan distance between the points `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[j][0], houses[j][1])`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
