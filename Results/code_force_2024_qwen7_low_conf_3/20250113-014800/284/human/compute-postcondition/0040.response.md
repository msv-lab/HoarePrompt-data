`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. The value of `j` is less than `n`, so `j + 1` is assigned to `visits[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is less than `n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `i` and `j` must be unequal, and `visits[i]` is `j + 1`.**
