The code updates the value of `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. The previous values of `i` and `j+1` are not directly used in this operation, but it's stated that `i` and `j+1` are not equal. The value of `dist` is not affected by this line of code, and it is updated separately to `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`.

Given the code snippet, the only change is in the `visits` list where the element at index `i` is now `j + 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j+1` are not equal; `visits[i]` is now `j + 1`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`.**
