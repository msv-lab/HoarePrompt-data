The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal if-structure. In this case, since there is no loop or if-structure present in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the state of any variables. The preconditions remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is less than `n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `i` and `j` must be unequal, and `visits[i]` is `j + 1`.**
