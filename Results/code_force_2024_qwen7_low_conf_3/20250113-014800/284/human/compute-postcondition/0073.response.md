The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Given that no such loop or if statement is mentioned in the provided code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j` are such that they are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
