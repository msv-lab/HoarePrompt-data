Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings, `a` is a list of integers where each element is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`, `houses` is a list of length `n` containing the tuples `(x, y)` where `x = i + 1` and `y = i % n + 1` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is a positive integer if there exists a `j` such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise, `visits[i]` is `-1`. The values of `x` and `y` for all tuples in `houses` are printed.**
