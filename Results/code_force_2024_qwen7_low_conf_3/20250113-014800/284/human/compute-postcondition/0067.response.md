According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the range from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and `visits[i+1]` is either `-1` or `j + 1` where `j` is the index that satisfies the condition `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1]) == a[i]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Incrementing `i`:** Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, after the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the previous value of `i` was `k` (where `k` is in the range `0` to `n-2`), then the new value of `i` will be `k+1`.

2. **Updating `visits`:** The value of `visits[i+1]` will be updated based on the condition `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1]) == a[i]`. This means that `visits[i+1]` will either remain `-1` or be updated to `j + 1` depending on the value of `j` that satisfies the condition.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is now `k+1` and `visits[k+2]` is either `-1` or `j + 1` where `j` is the index that satisfies the condition for the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2` (new value is `i+1`), `visits[i+2]` is either `-1` or `j + 1` where `j` is the index that satisfies the condition `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1]) == a[i]`, `houses` and `a` remain unchanged, and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`.**
