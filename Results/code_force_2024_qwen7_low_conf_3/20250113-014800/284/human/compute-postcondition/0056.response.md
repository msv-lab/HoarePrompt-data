`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. The value of `dist` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `dist` is the Manhattan distance between the points `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[j][0], houses[j][1])`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`.

Output State: **`dist` is the Manhattan distance between the points `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[j][0], houses[j][1])`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`**
