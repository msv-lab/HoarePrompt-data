Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Its Range:**
   - The loop variable is `j`, which ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine Initial Values for the Loop:**
   - Before the loop starts, `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`.

3. **Loop Body Consideration:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to ensure that the initial value of `j` allows the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust States:**
   - Since `j` is initialized to range from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, the loop can start as long as `j` is not equal to `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is not equal to `i` at the start of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop should be modified to reflect that `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, and `j` must not be equal to `i`.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`, `j` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`, and `j` must not be equal to `i`**
