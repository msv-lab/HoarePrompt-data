Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j+1` are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j+1]`. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the values of `visits[i]` and `dist` remain unchanged.***
