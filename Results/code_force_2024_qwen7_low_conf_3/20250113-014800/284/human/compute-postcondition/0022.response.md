The code initializes a list `visits` with `n` elements, each set to `-1`. This does not change the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings; `a` is a list of integers where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]` and each element in `a` is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`; `houses` is a list of length `n` containing the tuples `(x, y)` where `x` is `i + 1` and `y` is `i % n + 1` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `visits` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`.**
