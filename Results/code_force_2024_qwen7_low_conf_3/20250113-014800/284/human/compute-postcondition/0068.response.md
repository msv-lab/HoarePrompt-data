Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The variables involved in the for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Initial Values and Constraints**:
   - `i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`.
   - `visits[i+2]` is either `-1` or `j + 1` where `j` is the index that satisfies the condition `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1]) == a[i]`.
   - `houses` and `a` remain unchanged.
   - `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`.

4. **Determine the Initial State for the Loop**:
   - Since `j` iterates from `0` to `n-1`, the loop can execute as long as `n > 0`.
   - `i` is already defined as an integer within its range.
   - `visits[i+2]` is already set based on the given conditions.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 so that the loop can start iterating over `j`.
   - There is no initial value for `j`, but it will be initialized to `0` at the start of the loop.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
