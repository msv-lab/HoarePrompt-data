`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given that `j` is `n`, the value of `visits[i]` becomes `n + 1`. The values of `dist`, `visits[i]` (now updated), `i`, and `j` are now known.

Output State: **`dist` is the Manhattan distance between `(houses[i][0], houses[i][1])` and `(houses[n][0], houses[n][1])`, `visits[i]` is `n + 1`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `n`**
