The code `print(x, y)` simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since no variables are modified or reassigned within this code snippet, the only impact is the printing of `x` and `y`. The values of `n`, `data`, `a`, `visits`, and the structure of `houses` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, the remaining elements of `data` are even integers as strings, `a` is a list of integers where each element is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`, `visits` is a list of length `n`, the next tuple in `houses` is `(i + 2, (i + 1) % n + 1)` for some index `i` between `0` and `n-1`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
