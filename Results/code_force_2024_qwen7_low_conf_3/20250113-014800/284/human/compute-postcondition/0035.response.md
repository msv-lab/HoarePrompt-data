The code `break` is executed, which does not change the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `dist`, and `visits[i]`. It simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement, but since no such structure is present in the given snippet, it effectively ends the execution of the current context.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `visits[i]` is `j + 1`**
