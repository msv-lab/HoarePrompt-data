Output State: **`i` is an integer ranging from `0` to `n-2`, `visits[i+1]` is either `-1` or `j + 1` where `j` is the index that satisfies the condition `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1]) == a[i]`, `houses` and `a` remain unchanged, and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` excluding `i`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible `j` values (ranging from `0` to `n-1`) except for `i`.
- For each `j`, the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` is calculated.
- If this distance equals `a[i]`, `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`.
- The loop continues to check other `j` values until it finds one that satisfies the condition or until it has checked all possible `j` values.
- If no such `j` is found, `visits[i]` remains `-1`.

Since the loop checks every possible `j` for each `i`, after all iterations of the outer loop (`i` from `0` to `n-2`), the final state of `visits` will reflect whether any valid `j` was found for each `i`. The values of `i` and `houses` remain unchanged, and the values of `visits` will be either `-1` (if no valid `j` was found) or `j + 1` (where `j` is the index that satisfies the condition).
