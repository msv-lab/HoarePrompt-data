The code calculates the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` and assigns it to the variable `dist`. The Manhattan distance is computed as the sum of the absolute differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points.

The previous states of the variables are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` and `j+1` are not equal.
- `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j+1]`.
- If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `(j+1) + 1`.

After executing the code, the new state is:
- `dist` is updated to `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j+1` are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`; if `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `(j+1) + 1`. `dist` is updated to `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`.**
