The given code snippet only contains two print statements. These statements do not modify any variables but rather output the values of `x` and `y`. Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified, they remain unchanged after the print statements. The rest of the variables also remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, the remaining elements of `data` are even integers as strings, `a` is a list of integers where each element is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`, `visits` is a list of length `n`, the next tuple in `houses` is `(i + 2, (i + 1) % n + 1)` for some index `i` where `i + 1 < n`, and `x` and `y` are printed.**
