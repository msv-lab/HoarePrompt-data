The code `x = i + 1` increments the value of `i` by 1 and assigns the result to `x`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we only know that it will be incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings; `a` is a list of integers where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]` and each element in `a` is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`; `houses` is an empty list; `x` is `i + 1`.**
