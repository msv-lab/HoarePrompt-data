The code snippet appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `houses`. Based on the initial state:

- `x` is `i + 1`
- `y` is `i % n + 1`

The list `houses` is initially empty, so after appending the tuple `(x, y)`, `houses` will contain this single tuple.

The values of `n`, `data`, `a`, and `houses` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings; `a` is a list of integers where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]` and each element in `a` is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`; `houses` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)` where `x` is `i + 1` and `y` is `i % n + 1`; `x` is `i + 1`; `y` is `i % n + 1`.**
