The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes a list of integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` where each integer `a_i` is even, within the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. The function does not return any value but prints 'NO'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a list of integers and print 'NO' without returning any value.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers and prints 'NO' without returning any value.**
