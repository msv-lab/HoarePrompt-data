Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 1` elements, the first element of `data` is the integer value of `n`, and the remaining elements are even integers as strings; `a` is a list of integers where each element is an integer converted from the corresponding string in `data[1:]` and each element in `a` is less than or equal to `2 * (n - 1)`, `houses` is a list of length `n` containing the tuples `(x, y)` where `x` is `i + 1` and `y` is `i % n + 1` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1` if there exists a `j` such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise, `visits[i]` remains `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` range from `0` to `n-1` and `i != j`.
- For each pair `(i, j)`, the loop calculates the Manhattan distance `dist` between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`.
- If `dist` equals `a[i]`, the loop sets `visits[i]` to `j + 1` and breaks out of the inner loop.
- Since the loop runs for all possible pairs of `i` and `j`, after the loop completes, `visits[i]` will contain `j + 1` if there exists a `j` such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`, and `-1` otherwise.
- The variables `houses` and `a` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
