The code calculates the Manhattan distance between two points in a 2D space, given by `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. The Manhattan distance is defined as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates. 

- `houses[i][0]` and `houses[i][1]` represent the x and y coordinates of the first point.
- `houses[j][0]` and `houses[j][1]` represent the x and y coordinates of the second point.

The variable `dist` is assigned the value of the Manhattan distance between these two points. 

Since the initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` and `j` are not equal, these conditions remain unchanged. However, the value of `dist` is now calculated based on the given coordinates.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` and `j` are such that they are not equal; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`**
