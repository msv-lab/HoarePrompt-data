The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This does not affect the values of the variables `n` or the list `a_1, \ldots, a_n`. Therefore, the only change is that the `input` function is now using `sys.stdin.read` instead of the default behavior. However, since no specific action is taken with this reassignment in the provided snippet, the values of `n` and the list `a_1, \ldots, a_n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, \ldots, a_n is given, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n and all a_i are even; the built-in `input` function is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`**
