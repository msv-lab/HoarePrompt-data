Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers representing distances and checks if these distances can be satisfied by placing `n` houses in a circular manner such that the Manhattan distance between certain pairs of houses matches the given distances. If it is possible to satisfy all distances, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the houses and the indices of the houses they visit. If it is not possible, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function includes a check to ensure that no distance in the list exceeds `2 * (n - 1)`. If any distance exceeds this limit, the function immediately prints 'NO' and exits, which is correctly annotated.
- The function ensures that all elements in the list `a` are even and within the specified range, but it does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is 1 or 2, although this is implied by the range constraints.
- The function uses a nested loop to check all pairs of houses for the Manhattan distance match, which is computationally expensive for large `n`. However, the function logic correctly handles all cases where a valid assignment of visits is possible.
- The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and that all elements in the list `a` are valid integers. It does not handle cases where the input is malformed or contains non-integer values, although this is checked implicitly by the input processing steps.
- After determining the visits, the function prints the coordinates of the houses and their visiting indices, but it does not explicitly validate whether the visiting indices form a valid sequence of visits. This means that if the visits are valid but the sequence is not cyclic or does not form a proper visiting order, the function may still print 'YES' incorrectly. However, the function correctly prints 'NO' if any visit index is `-1`.
