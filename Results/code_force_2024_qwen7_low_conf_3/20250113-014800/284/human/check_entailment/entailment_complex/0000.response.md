Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and checks if any given distance `a_i` is greater than `2 * (n - 1)`. If so, it immediately prints "NO" and returns, which is correct because the maximum possible Manhattan distance between any two houses in an `n x n` grid is `2 * (n - 1)`.
2. The program then attempts to place the houses in a grid such that the distance constraints are met. Specifically, it places the houses in a spiral pattern (or a close approximation), ensuring that no two houses share the same column. This ensures that each wizard has a unique column, satisfying the view requirement.
3. After placing the houses, the program iterates through each house to find a house that meets the required distance `a_i`. It does this by checking the Manhattan distance between each pair of houses and setting the corresponding `visits[i]` to the index of the visiting house if the distance matches `a_i`.
4. Finally, the program checks if any house was not visited (`visits` contains `-1`). If any house is unvisited, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the houses and the indices of the houses they visit.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the program, it appears that the program correctly addresses the problem constraints and requirements. It checks the feasibility of placing the houses and verifies the distance requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
