Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input as a single line and splits it into tokens. It then converts the first token to an integer `n` and the subsequent tokens to a list of integers `a`.
   - It checks if any `a_i` is greater than `2 * (n - 1)`. If so, it prints "NO" and returns immediately. This handles the requirement that the distance `a_i` must be within the allowed range.

2. **House Placement:**
   - The program places the houses in a specific pattern. For each wizard `i`, it assigns coordinates `(i + 1, i % n + 1)`. This ensures that each house is placed in a unique column.
   - This placement guarantees that no two houses share the same column, satisfying the requirement that each column can have only one house.

3. **Distance Check:**
   - The program then iterates over each wizard `i` and checks if there exists another house `j` such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`.
   - If such a house is found, the index `j + 1` is stored in `visits[i]`.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - If the check finds that there is no valid placement (i.e., `-1` is found in `visits`), the program prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of each house and the indices indicating the house each wizard should visit.

### Key Points:
- **Column Uniqueness:** The placement ensures that no two houses share the same column, which directly satisfies the requirement.
- **Distance Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the Manhattan distance and checks if it matches the required distances `a_i`.
- **Output Format:** The program outputs the correct format as specified in the problem description, including both the "YES" or "NO" decision and the coordinates and visit information.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for placing the houses and checking the distances as per the problem statement, it meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
