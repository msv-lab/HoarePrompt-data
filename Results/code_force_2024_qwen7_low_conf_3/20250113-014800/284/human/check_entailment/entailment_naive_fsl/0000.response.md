Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the requirement that no two houses can share the same column. Specifically, the code generates houses along a diagonal pattern (i.e., \( (i+1, i \% n + 1) \)), which does not ensure that no two houses share the same column. For example, if \( n = 4 \) and the input is \( a = [0, 4, 2, 4] \), the generated house positions would be:

- House 1: (1, 1)
- House 2: (2, 2)
- House 3: (3, 3)
- House 4: (4, 4)

In this case, all houses are placed on the main diagonal, meaning they all share the same column (the first column). This violates the requirement that no two houses can be in the same column.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the generated house positions are unique in terms of columns. One possible approach could involve generating houses such that each house is placed in a different column, ensuring that the distance constraints and column uniqueness are maintained.
