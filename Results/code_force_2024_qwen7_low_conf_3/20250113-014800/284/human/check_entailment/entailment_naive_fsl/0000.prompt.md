You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between this and the hard version is that all a_{i} are
even.

After some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of
the Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses
will be situated on a picturesque n\times n square field. Each wizard will
have their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house
will take up the space of one square.

However, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the
weekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0
\leq a_{i} \leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are
built horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},
y_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -
y_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit
another wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built
will be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.

Apart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle
in the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other
wizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each
column of the n\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i
-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \neq x_{j} for all i
\neq j .

The Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses
in such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n
wizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.

If it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard
there is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard
is the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each
wizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the
weekends.

If it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.

Input

The first line contains n (2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses
to be built.

The second line contains n integers a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} (0 \leq a_{i} \leq n)
. All a_{i} are even.

Output

If there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,
output NO.

If the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.

The next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \leq x_{i},
y_{i} \leq n for each wizard.

The i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the
house of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If
there are multiple such wizards, you can output any.

If there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.

Example

Input

    4
    0 4 2 4

Output

    YES
    4 4
    1 3
    2 4
    3 1
    1 1 1 3

Note

For the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd
at (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .

The distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .

The distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .

The distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .

The distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard
is |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .

The view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the
placement is correct.

                    visits[i] = j + 1
                    break
    if -1 in visits:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        for (x, y) in houses:
            print(x, y)
        print(' '.join(map(str, visits)))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
