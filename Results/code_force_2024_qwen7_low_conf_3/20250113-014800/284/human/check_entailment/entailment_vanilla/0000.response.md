Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program checks if any `a_i` is greater than `2 * (n - 1)`. Since `a_i` are guaranteed to be even and within the range `[0, n]`, this check is sufficient to ensure that the Manhattan distance condition is met.
2. **Placement of Houses**: The program places the houses in a specific pattern where the `x` coordinate corresponds to the index of the wizard plus 1, and the `y` coordinate is determined by the wizard's index modulo `n` plus 1. This ensures that no two houses share the same column.
3. **Visit Assignment**: For each wizard, the program attempts to find another wizard whose house is exactly `a_i` units away using the pre-placed houses. This check is done by iterating through all other wizards' positions.
4. **Output**: If a valid assignment is found for all wizards, the program prints "YES" followed by the positions of the houses and the corresponding indices. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the constraints and the logic of the program, it correctly handles the problem requirements. It validates the input, places the houses in a way that satisfies the column restriction, and assigns visits while ensuring all distances match the specified `a_i`.

Correctness: **True**
