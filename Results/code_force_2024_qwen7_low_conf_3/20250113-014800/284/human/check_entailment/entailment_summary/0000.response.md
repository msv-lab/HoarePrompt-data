Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if it's possible to place \( n \) houses in an \( n \times n \) grid such that each wizard can visit another house at a specific distance \( a_i \), and no two houses share the same column.
2. The provided program attempts to solve this by:
   - Reading the input values.
   - Ensuring no distance \( a_i \) exceeds \( 2 \times (n - 1) \).
   - Placing the houses in a circular manner (each house at position \( (i+1, i \% n + 1) \)).
   - For each wizard, finding another house that is exactly \( a_i \) away.
   - Printing 'YES' and the positions along with the visiting information if all distances are satisfied, otherwise printing 'NO'.
3. The program logic seems to handle the constraints and requirements correctly:
   - It ensures no house is placed in the same column (achieved by using distinct \( y \)-coordinates).
   - It checks and satisfies the distance requirement for each wizard.
   - It handles the case where a valid placement is not found.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to meet the requirements and constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
