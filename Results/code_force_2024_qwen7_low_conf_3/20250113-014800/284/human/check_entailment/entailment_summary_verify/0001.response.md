### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program checks if any `a_i` is greater than `2 * (n - 1)`. This check is indeed necessary because the maximum possible Manhattan distance between any two houses in an `n x n` grid is `2 * (n - 1)`. However, since all `a_i` are even and within the range `[0, n]`, this check is sufficient to ensure that the distance condition is met.

2. **Placement of Houses**:
   - The program places the houses in a circular manner where the `x` coordinate corresponds to the index of the wizard plus 1, and the `y` coordinate is determined by the wizard's index modulo `n` plus 1. This ensures that no two houses share the same column, which aligns with the requirement that no house can be in the same column as another.

3. **Visit Assignment**:
   - The program attempts to find another wizard whose house is exactly `a_i` units away by iterating through all other wizards' positions. This approach works because the houses are placed in a specific pattern that allows the Manhattan distance to be calculated easily. The loop ensures that each wizard can find a valid visit.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid assignment is found for all wizards, the program prints "YES" followed by the positions of the houses and the corresponding indices. Otherwise, it prints "NO". This output format matches the problem requirements.

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly implements the input validation, house placement, and visit assignment steps as described in the original assessment.
- The logic is sound and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description.
- The program does not return any value but instead prints directly, which is appropriate given the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
