The function processes a list of integers representing distances and checks if these distances can be satisfied by placing `n` houses in a circular manner such that the Manhattan distance between certain pairs of houses matches the given distances. If it is possible to satisfy all distances, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the houses and the indices of the houses they visit. If it is not possible, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
