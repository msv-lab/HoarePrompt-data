### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to see if it meets the requirements as described.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - For the \( i \)-th outcome, if it wins, we get back \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers, denoted as `prod`.
   - It then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is `prod // k_i`.
   - It checks if the denominator obtained by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `prod` is less than or equal to zero. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

3. **Key Observation**:
   - The calculation of `vprod` as `prod // k_i` suggests that the program is attempting to distribute the total product equally among the outcomes, but this does not necessarily ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     3
     3 2 7
     ```
     - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`.
     - `vprod = [14, 21, 6]` (since `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, `42 // 7 = 6`).
     - Total bet = `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is indeed less than `42` for all outcomes.
   - This example satisfies the condition, but we need to check if this holds generally.

4. **General Proof**:
   - For any set of multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \), the product `prod` is `k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.
   - Each element in `vprod` is `prod // k_i`, so the sum of `vprod` is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j}{k_i}\right) = \prod_{j \neq i} k_j
     \]
   - Therefore, the difference between `prod` and the sum of `vprod` is:
     \[
     \prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j}{k_i}\right) = \prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j \left(1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i}\right)
     \]
   - Since `k_i >= 2` for all \( i \), the term `1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i}` is always positive, ensuring that the difference is strictly positive.
   - Hence, the total bet is always strictly less than the sum of the winnings for each outcome.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly distributes the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.
