The code `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. 

- The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- The variable `N` remains unchanged and holds an integer.
- The variable `input()` now expects a line of space-separated integers, which are then converted and stored in the list `vals`.

Since the exact input is not specified, the output state will describe the current conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, N is an input integer, and vals is a list of integers obtained from the input line.**
