The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. From the initial state, we know that `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`. However, since `i` is already `i + 1`, the current value of `i` is effectively `i + 1`, which means `a[i]` does not refer to the original `a[i]` but rather the next element in the list, `a[i + 1]`. Also, `prod` remains unchanged, and `sumo` will be updated in this iteration.

Given these points, we can update the value of `sumo` as follows:
- `sumo` is updated by adding the integer value of `a[i + 1]` to its current value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `prod` is unchanged, and `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[i + 1])`.

Output State: **`a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `prod` is unchanged, and `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[i + 1])**.
