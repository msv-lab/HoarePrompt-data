Output State: **`i` is `bets`, `ans` is the concatenation of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for \(0 \leq i < \text{bets}\), `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
