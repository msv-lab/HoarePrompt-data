The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` increments the `ans` string by appending `str(a[i])` followed by a space. The value of `i` is in the range `[0, bets-1]`, meaning `i` is incremented by `1` and must still be within this range. However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, so we can only say that `ans` is updated with the string representation of `a[i]` plus a space. The value of `i` is incremented by `1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` and within the range `[0, bets-1]`, `ans` is updated with `ans += str(a[i-1]) + ' '`**
