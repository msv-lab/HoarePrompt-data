`sumo` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, which is `a[1]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `a[i]` is `a[1]`. Since `sumo` was previously `sumo + prod // a[1]`, the new value of `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `a[1]`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is `a[1]`, `sumo` is `sumo + prod // a[1] + a[1]`**
