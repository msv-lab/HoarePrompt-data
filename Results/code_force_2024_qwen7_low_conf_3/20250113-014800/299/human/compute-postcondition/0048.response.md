Output State: **`bets` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the LCM of all integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is `len(a)`, `T` is `t`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using `i` as the index.
- Initially, `g` is set to `l[0]`.
- On each iteration, `g` is updated by multiplying `g` with `l[i]` and dividing by the GCD of `g` and `l[i]`.
- After the loop completes, `g` will hold the product of all elements in `l` divided by their GCD, which is the LCM of all elements in the list `a`.

Since the loop iterates through all elements in `a`, `i` will eventually become `len(a)`, and `g` will hold the LCM of all elements in `a`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `a` is an empty list), then `g` remains its initial value of `1`. However, the problem specifies that `l` is a non-empty list, so `g` will be correctly updated to the LCM of all elements in `a` after the loop completes.
