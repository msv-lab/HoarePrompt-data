`sumo` is incremented by the integer value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` is `bets`, so `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `i` is `bets`; `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`; `t` is `T`; `a` is unchanged; `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[i])`; `g` is unchanged**
