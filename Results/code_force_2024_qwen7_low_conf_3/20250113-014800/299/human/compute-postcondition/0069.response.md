The line `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of an empty string to `ans`.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is `T`, `a` is unchanged, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `g` is unchanged, `ans` is an empty string.**
