According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(l)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `bets` is an integer input
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a list of integers
- `prod` is the LCM of all integers in `a`
- `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `l` is a non-empty list
- `i` is 1 (initial value)
- `T` is `t`
- `g` is `g0 * l1 // gcd(g0, l1)`

Since `i` is 1 and the loop iterates over the indices of `l`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.

Given that `i` starts at 1 and needs to be incremented to the next index, the new state will have `i` as 2. Since `l` is a non-empty list, it must have at least one element, but the exact length of `l` is not specified beyond that. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`bets` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the LCM of all integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `T` is `t`, `g` is `g0 * l1 // gcd(g0, l1)`**
