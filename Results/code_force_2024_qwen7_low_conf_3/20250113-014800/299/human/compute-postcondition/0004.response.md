`prod` is assigned the value of `prod` multiplied by `r`. The value of `prod` is initially 1, so after the multiplication, `prod` becomes `prod * r`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `N`, and `vals`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `prod` is `prod * r`.**
