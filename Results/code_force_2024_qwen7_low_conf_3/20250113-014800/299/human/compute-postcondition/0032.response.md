The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `i`, `a`, or the current value of `ans`, the exact output cannot be determined without knowing these values. However, we can express the general impact on the variables involved.

Initially, `ans` is an empty string. After executing the line `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, `ans` will contain the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 'str(a[i]) ', `i` must be in the range [0, bets-1], `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for \(0 \leq i < \text{bets}\), `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
