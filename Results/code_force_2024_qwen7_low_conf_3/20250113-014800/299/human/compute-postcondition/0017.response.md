The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, â€¦, k_n`. The function ensures that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^4\), and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and each `k_i` is an integer within the range of 2 to 20. Additionally, the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\). The function does not modify any variables and prints -1 to the console. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a series of test cases without modifying any variables and print -1 to the console.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, processes a series of test cases without modifying any variables, and prints -1 to the console.**
