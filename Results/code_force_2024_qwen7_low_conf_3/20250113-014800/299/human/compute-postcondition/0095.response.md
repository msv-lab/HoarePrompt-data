Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `bets` is the user's input (converted to an integer).
- `i` is either `0` or `bets - 1`.
- `a[i]` is `lcm(a) // a[i]`.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `a` is now `input_list`.
- `sumo` is `0`.
- `g` is unchanged.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition
The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < bets`.

### Analysis
1. **`bets`**: This is the number of iterations the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `bets` must be a positive integer.
2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `0` or `bets - 1`. Since the loop runs from `0` to `bets - 1`, `i` must start at `0` to allow the loop to iterate correctly.
3. **`a[i]`**: The value of `a[i]` is already defined as `lcm(a) // a[i]`. This does not affect the loop execution directly but ensures that `a[i]` is valid for the loop to use.
4. **`t`**: This variable is unchanged, so it doesn't affect the loop execution.
5. **`a`**: The variable `a` is now set to `input_list`, ensuring that the correct list is used in the loop.
6. **`sumo`**: This variable is `0` and is not used in the loop condition, so its value doesn't impact the loop execution.
7. **`g`**: This variable is unchanged, so it doesn't affect the loop execution.
8. **`l`**: The list `l` remains unchanged, so it doesn't impact the loop execution.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to ensure that `bets` is a positive integer and that `i` starts at `0`.

### Final State Adjustment
State: **`bets` must be a positive integer, `i` must start at 0`**
