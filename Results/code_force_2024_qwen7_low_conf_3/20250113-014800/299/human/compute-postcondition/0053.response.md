The input `.split()` function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. Each string is then converted to an integer using `int()`. This means `a` is updated to be a list of integers based on the input.

Given the initial state:
- `bets` is an input integer
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a list of integers
- `prod` is the LCM of all integers in `a`
- `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `i` is `bets`
- `T` is `t`
- `g` remains unchanged

After running the code snippet:
- `a` is updated to be a list of integers based on the input.
- The values of `bets`, `t`, `prod`, `sumo`, `i`, `T`, and `g` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the LCM of all integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is `bets`, `T` is `t`, and `g` remains unchanged.**
