`ans` is initially set to `"prod // a[i]"`. After executing the line `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, the value of `ans` is updated to concatenate the string representation of `a[i]` (which is `prod // a[i]`) with a space. Therefore, `ans` now contains both parts separated by a space.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is `T`, `a` is unchanged, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `g` is unchanged, `ans` is `"prod // a[i] prod // a[i]"`**
