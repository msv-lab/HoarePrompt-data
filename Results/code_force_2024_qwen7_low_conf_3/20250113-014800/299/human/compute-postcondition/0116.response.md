The code `print(ans)` prints the value of the variable `ans`, which is a concatenated string. This does not change the value of `ans` or any other variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[bets - 1]`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` and is still less than `prod`, `ans` is the concatenated string representation of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, each followed by a space.**
