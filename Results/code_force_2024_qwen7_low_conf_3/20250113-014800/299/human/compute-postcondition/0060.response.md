The code `a[i] = prod // a[i]` updates the value of `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`. Given the initial state, we know that `a[i]` was originally `prod // a[i]`, so updating it with itself does not change its value.

Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. 

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `i` is `bets - 1`; `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`; `t` is `T`; `a` is unchanged; `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[i])`; `g` is unchanged**
