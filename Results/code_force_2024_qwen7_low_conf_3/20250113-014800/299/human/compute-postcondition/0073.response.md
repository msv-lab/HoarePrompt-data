The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to `ans`. Given the initial state:

- `bets` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 0
- `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`
- `t` is `T`
- `a` is unchanged
- `sumo` is less than `prod`
- `g` is unchanged
- `ans` is an empty string followed by the string representation of `a[i]` and a space

After executing the line `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, the value of `ans` changes to include the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. Since `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, we can express `ans` as `ans` is now "prod // a[i] ".

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is `T`, `a` is unchanged, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `g` is unchanged, `ans` is "prod // a[i] "**
