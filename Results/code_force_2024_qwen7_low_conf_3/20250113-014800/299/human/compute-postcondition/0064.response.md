`sumo` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, the value added to `sumo` is `prod // a[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is `bets`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is unchanged, `sumo` is `sumo + prod // a[i]`, `g` is unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is `bets`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is unchanged, `sumo` is `sumo + prod // a[i]`, `g` is unchanged**
