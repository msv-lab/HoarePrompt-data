`ans` is assigned the value of itself plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is the string representation of `prod // a[0]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` and is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of `prod // a[0]` followed by a space**
