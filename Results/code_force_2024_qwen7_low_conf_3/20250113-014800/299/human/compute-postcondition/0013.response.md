The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The only change is the output to the console.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is an empty list, `prod` is 1, `vprod` is an empty list, `den` is 1, and the value `-1` is printed to the console.**
