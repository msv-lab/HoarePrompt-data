`ans` is assigned the value of itself plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. Since `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, the updated `ans` will include this value in string format followed by a space. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is `T`, `a` is unchanged, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `g` is unchanged, `ans` is an empty string followed by the string representation of `a[i]` and a space**
