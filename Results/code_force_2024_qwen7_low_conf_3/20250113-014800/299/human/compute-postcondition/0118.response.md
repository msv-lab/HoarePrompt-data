Output State: **`bets` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for \(0 \leq i < \text{bets}\), `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and if `sumo >= prod`, the output is `-1`; otherwise, `ans` is the concatenation of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces and `ans` is printed.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `bets` is the number of inputs for the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `prod` is initially set to the LCM of the elements in `a`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The outer `for T in range(t)` loop runs `t` times, but its effect is to process each `bets` input independently.
   - Inside the loop, the function `lcm(l)` calculates the LCM of the list `a`.
   - For each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`.
   - If `sumo >= prod`, the output is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is constructed as a string of the updated elements in `a`, each followed by a space, and this string is printed.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - After all iterations, `bets` remains as the number of inputs.
   - `t` retains its original value.
   - `a` contains the updated values `prod // a[i]` for all `0 \leq i < \text{bets}`.
   - `prod` is the LCM of the updated list `a`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`.
   - If `sumo >= prod`, the output is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is the concatenated string representation of the updated list `a`, each element followed by a space.

Thus, the final output state captures the transformation of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.
