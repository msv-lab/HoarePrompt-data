The code `prod = lcm(a)` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in the list `a`. The LCM of a set of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the integers in the set.

Given the initial state:
- `bets` is the user's input (converted to an integer)
- `i` is either `0` or `bets - 1`
- `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`
- `t` is unchanged
- `a` is now `input_list`
- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each element in `a`
- `g` is unchanged
- The list `l` remains unchanged

After executing the line `prod = lcm(a)`, the value of `prod` is updated to the LCM of the elements in the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is the user's input (converted to an integer), `i` is either `0` or `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is `lcm(a) // a[i]`, `t` is unchanged, `a` is now `input_list`, `sumo` is the sum of `lcm(a) // a[i]` for each element in `a`, `g` is unchanged, and the list `l` remains unchanged.**
