The code `sumo = 0` sets the variable `sumo` to 0. The value of `sumo` was previously the sum of `lcm(a) // a[i]` for each element in `a`, but now it is explicitly set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is the user's input (converted to an integer), `i` is either `0` or `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is `lcm(a) // a[i]`, `t` is unchanged, `a` is now `input_list`, `sumo` is 0, `g` is unchanged, and the list `l` remains unchanged.**
