`sumo` is assigned the value of `int(a[i])`. The value of `a[i]` was previously updated to `prod // a[i]`, so now `sumo` is the integer value of `a[i]`, which is `prod // a[i]`. The value of `i` and `prod` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is modified to have `a[i]` as `prod // a[i]`.

Output State: **`a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `i` is unchanged, `prod` is unchanged, `sumo` is `int(a[i])` (which is `prod // a[i]`)**
