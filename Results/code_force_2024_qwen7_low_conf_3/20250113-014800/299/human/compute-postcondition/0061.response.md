The code `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the variable `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `bets` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `bets - 1`
- `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`
- `t` is `T`
- `a` is unchanged
- `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[i])`
- `g` is unchanged

The value of `a[i]` is already calculated as `prod // a[i]`, so when we add `int(a[i])` to `sumo`, `sumo` gets updated to `sumo + (prod // a[i]) + (prod // a[i])`, which simplifies to `sumo + 2 * (prod // a[i])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `bets` must be greater than 0; `i` is `bets - 1`; `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`; `t` is `T`; `a` is unchanged; `sumo` is `sumo + 2 * (prod // a[i])`; `g` is unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `i` is `bets - 1`; `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`; `t` is `T`; `a` is unchanged; `sumo` is `sumo + 2 * (prod // a[i])`; `g` is unchanged**
