The code snippet `prod = lcm(a)` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `prod`. Since the LCM of all integers in `a` is being calculated and stored in `prod`, the value of `prod` will be updated based on the new list `a`.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the LCM of all integers in the updated `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is `bets`, `T` is `t`, and `g` remains unchanged.**
