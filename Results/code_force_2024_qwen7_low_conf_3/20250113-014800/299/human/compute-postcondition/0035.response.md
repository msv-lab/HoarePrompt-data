Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - The loop variable `i` is set to `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration and is within the range `[0, bets-1]`.
   - The variable `ans` is updated with `ans += str(a[i-1]) + ' '`.

2. **Loop Range**:
   - The for loop iterates over `range(bets)`, meaning it runs from `0` to `bets-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` (so if `i` was `0` before, now it is `1`, etc.).
   - `ans` contains the concatenated string from the previous iterations.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range `[0, bets-1]`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, we need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration.

5. **Determining the Next Value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `k + 1` must still be within the range `[0, bets-1]`.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` needs to be `i + 1` again for the next iteration.
   - `ans` should be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the current value of `i` as `k`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `(i + 1) + 1 = i + 2`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `i + 2` and within the range `[0, bets-1]`.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `ans` is updated with `ans += str(a[i-1]) + ' '`**
