`a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`. Initially, `a[i]` was `prod // a[1]`. So, after the assignment, `a[i]` becomes `prod // (prod // a[1])`, which simplifies to `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`, `sumo` is `sumo + prod // a[1]`**
