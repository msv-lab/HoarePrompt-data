Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer \(N\) followed by a list of \(N\) integers. It calculates the product of all integers in the list and then computes a list of values where each element is the product of all elements divided by the corresponding element in the original list. If the denominator obtained from subtracting the sum of the computed list from the total product is less than or equal to zero, it prints -1 to the console. Otherwise, it prints the list of computed values. The function does not modify any input variables and relies on input provided through standard input.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If any integer in the list is zero, the division operation would result in a runtime error. However, the code does not handle this case, which could lead to a division by zero error.
- If the list is empty, the product `prod` remains 1, and the list `vprod` will also be empty, leading to no output.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not provide any handling for invalid inputs such as non-positive integers for \(N\) or \(k_i\) values outside the specified range. This could result in unexpected behavior or errors during execution.
