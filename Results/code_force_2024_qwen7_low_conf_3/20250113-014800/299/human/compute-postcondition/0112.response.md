The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` to the existing string in `ans` followed by a space. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value being appended is `str(a[1])`. 

The initial state is:
- `bets` is a positive integer
- `i` is 1
- `a[i]` is `prod // a[1]`
- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` including `prod // a[1]` and is still less than `prod`
- `ans` is the string representation of `prod // a[0]` followed by a space and then `prod // a[1]`

After executing the line `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, the updated `ans` will include the string representation of `a[1]` appended to the existing string. Therefore, `ans` will now be the string representation of `prod // a[0]` followed by a space, then `prod // a[1]` followed by another space, and then the string representation of `a[1]`.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `prod // a[1]`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` including `prod // a[1]` and is still less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of `prod // a[0]` followed by a space, `prod // a[1]`, followed by a space, and then the string representation of `a[1]`**
