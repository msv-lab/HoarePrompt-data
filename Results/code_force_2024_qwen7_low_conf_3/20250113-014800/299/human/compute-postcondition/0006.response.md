The code multiplies `prod` by `r`. The previous value of `prod` is `prod * r`, and the value of `r` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `prod` is the product of its previous value and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one remaining element, and `prod` is equal to its previous value multiplied by `r`.**
