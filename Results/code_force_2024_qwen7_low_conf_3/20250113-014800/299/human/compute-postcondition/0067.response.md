The code snippet `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is `0`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is `T`, `a` is unchanged, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each element in `a` and currently satisfies `sumo >= prod`, `g` is unchanged, print output is -1**
