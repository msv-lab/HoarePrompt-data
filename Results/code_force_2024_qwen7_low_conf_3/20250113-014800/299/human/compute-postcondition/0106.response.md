The code `print(-1)` does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. It only prints `-1` to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and -1 is printed to the console.**
