Postcondition: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then -1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, `ans` is the concatenated string representation of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, each followed by a space.**
