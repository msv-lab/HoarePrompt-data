The variable `g` is assigned the value `1`. This does not affect any other variables. The initial conditions of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is either `0` or `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is `t`, `a` is unchanged, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each element in `a`, `g` is `1`, `ans` is not yet determined based on the condition `if sumo >= prod`.**
