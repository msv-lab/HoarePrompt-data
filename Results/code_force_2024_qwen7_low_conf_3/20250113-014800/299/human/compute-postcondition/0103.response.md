`sumo` is incremented by the value of `int(a[i])`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[2])`.

Output State: **`bets` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is `a[1]`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`, `sumo` is `sumo + prod // a[1] + a[1] + int(a[2])`**
