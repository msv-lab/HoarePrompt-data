The function `lcm` accepts a parameter `l`. `l` is a list of integers. The functionality of the function `lcm` is to return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `l`.

However, based on the provided constraints and output description, it seems there might be some confusion. The output description suggests the function should return the product of all elements in the list `l`, but the constraints and the function name `lcm` (Least Common Multiple) do not align with this. Given the provided information:

- The function returns `g`, which is the product of all elements in list `l`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `lcm` is to accept a list `l` and return the product of all elements in the list `l`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers, and returns the product of all elements in the list `l`.**
