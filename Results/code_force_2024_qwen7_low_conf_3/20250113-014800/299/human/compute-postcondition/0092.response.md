The code snippet `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns this new list to `a`. The initial values of `bets`, `i`, `a[i]`, `t`, `a`, `sumo`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The user inputs a series of space-separated integers.
2. These integers are split and converted to integers, forming a new list.
3. This new list is assigned to `a`.

Since the exact input values are not specified, let's denote the user input as a list of integers `input_list`. After executing the code, `a` will be equal to `input_list`.

Output State: **`bets` is assigned the value of the user's input (converted to an integer), `i` is either `0` or `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `t` is `t`, `a` is now `input_list`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each element in `a`, `g` is unchanged, and the list `l` remains unchanged.**
