According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `bets`. The loop will only execute if `bets` is at least 1. Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `bets` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to `bets`.
- `t` remains as `T` (which is the original value of `t`).
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `prod` remains unchanged.
- `sumo` remains 0.
- `g` remains unchanged.

State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is `bets`, `t` is `T`, `a` is unchanged, `prod` is unchanged, `sumo` is 0, `g` is unchanged**
