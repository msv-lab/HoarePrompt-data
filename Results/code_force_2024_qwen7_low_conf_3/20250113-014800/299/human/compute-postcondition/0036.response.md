`i` is incremented by 2, and `ans` is updated with `ans += str(a[i-1]) + ' '`. Then, `ans` is further updated with `str(a[i]) + ' '`. Given these operations, the value of `i` is now `i + 2`, and `ans` includes the concatenated strings of `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` followed by spaces.

Since the exact values of `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` are not provided, the output state is expressed in terms of these values.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `ans` is `ans += str(a[i-1]) + ' ' + str(a[i]) + ' '`**
