The code snippet `prod *= r` multiplies the current value of `prod` by `r`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N` is an input integer.
- `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one remaining element.
- `prod` is equal to its previous value multiplied by `r`.

After executing `prod *= r`:

- The value of `prod` is updated to the previous value of `prod` multiplied by `r`.
- The states of `t`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one remaining element, and `prod` is equal to its previous value multiplied by `r`.**
