#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must be empty (i.e., no elements left in the list), and `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        return
        #None of the variables are modified, and -1 is printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is an empty list, `prod` is 1, `vprod` is an empty list, `den` is greater than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer \(N\) followed by a list of \(N\) integers. It calculates the product of all integers in the list and then computes a list of values where each element is the product of all elements divided by the corresponding element in the original list. If the denominator obtained from subtracting the sum of the computed list from the total product is less than or equal to zero, it prints -1 to the console. Otherwise, it prints the list of computed values. The function does not modify any input variables and relies on input provided through standard input.
