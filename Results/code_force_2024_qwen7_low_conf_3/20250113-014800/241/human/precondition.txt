grid is a 2D list representing the rectangular grid where each element is either '.', '*', or 'X'. r and c are the dimensions of the grid (1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50). i1, j1, i2, j2 are integers representing the coordinates of the pixels (1 ≤ i1, i2 ≤ r, 1 ≤ j1, j2 ≤ c) involved in a potential move. visited is a set used to keep track of visited pixels during the movement validation process.
