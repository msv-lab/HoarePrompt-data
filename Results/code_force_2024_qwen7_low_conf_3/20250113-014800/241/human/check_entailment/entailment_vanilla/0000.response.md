### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid.
- It ensures that the target cell `(i2, j2)` is within bounds, unoccupied, and connected to at least two existing cells of Amanda's body.
- This function is crucial for ensuring that the movements are valid.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position.
- It uses `func_1` to check the validity of each move.
- The BFS algorithm is used to explore all possible paths from the initial position to the final position.
- If a valid path is found, it traces back the moves using the `parent` dictionary to construct the sequence of moves.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input grid dimensions and initial and final positions.
- It identifies the initial and final positions of Amanda.
- It calls `func_2` to find the sequence of moves.
- It prints "YES" and the number of moves along with the details of each move if a valid path is found.
- If no valid path is found, it prints "NO".

### Key Points to Check for Correctness:
1. **Boundary Checks**: Ensure that the target cell is within the grid bounds.
2. **Occupancy Check**: Ensure the target cell is free.
3. **Connection Check**: Ensure the target cell is connected to at least two existing cells of Amanda's body.
4. **Path Validity**: Ensure that the path found is valid and connects the initial and final positions.
5. **Output Format**: Ensure the output format matches the problem requirements.

### Analysis:
- **Boundary and Occupancy Checks**: The function `func_1` correctly handles boundary conditions and checks for occupied cells.
- **Connection Check**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the target cell is connected to at least two existing cells.
- **Path Validity**: The BFS implementation in `func_2` correctly explores all possible paths and uses `func_1` to ensure each move is valid.
- **Output Format**: The output format is correctly implemented to match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Amanda can move from the initial position to the final position and outputs the sequence of valid moves if possible.

### Correctness:
**True**
