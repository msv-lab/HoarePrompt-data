### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid.
- It ensures that the target cell `(i2, j2)` is within bounds, unoccupied, and connected to at least two existing cells of Amanda's body.
- This function is crucial for ensuring that the movements are valid.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position.
- It uses `func_1` to check the validity of each move.
- The BFS algorithm is used to explore all possible paths from the initial position to the final position.
- If a valid path is found, it traces back the moves using the `parent` dictionary to construct the sequence of moves.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input grid dimensions and initial and final positions.
- It identifies the initial and final positions of Amanda.
- It calls `func_2` to find the sequence of moves.
- It prints "YES" and the number of moves along with the details of each move if a valid path is found.
- If no valid path is found, it prints "NO".

### Key Points to Check for Correctness:
1. **Boundary Checks**: Ensure that the target cell is within the grid bounds.
2. **Occupancy Check**: Ensure the target cell is free.
3. **Connection Check**: Ensure the target cell is connected to at least two existing cells of Amanda's body.
4. **Path Validity**: Ensure that the path found is valid and connects the initial and final positions.
5. **Output Format**: Ensure the output format matches the problem requirements.

### Analysis:
- **Boundary and Occupancy Checks**: The function `func_1` correctly handles boundary conditions and checks for occupied cells.
- **Connection Check**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the target cell is connected to at least two existing cells.
- **Path Validity**: The BFS implementation in `func_2` correctly explores all possible paths and uses `func_1` to ensure each move is valid.
- **Output Format**: The output format is correctly implemented to match the problem requirements.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Multiple Connected Components**: The problem states that Amanda's body must remain connected during the movement. The current implementation does not explicitly handle this condition. While the `func_1` check ensures the new pixel is connected to at least two existing cells, it does not guarantee that the entire body remains connected during the movement.
2. **Optimality of Path**: The BFS approach finds a valid path but may not necessarily find the shortest path. However, since the problem allows up to 10,000 moves, this is not a critical issue.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where the initial and final positions are very close to each other, and the body is already connected in such a way that minimal moves are required.

### Conclusion:
While the current implementation appears to handle the basic requirements correctly, there is a potential oversight in ensuring the body remains connected throughout the movement. The provided solution does not explicitly verify the connectivity of the body after each move, which could lead to invalid paths.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
