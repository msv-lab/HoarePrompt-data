### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - The problem requires Amanda's body to move in a way that maintains connectivity and shrinks and grows appropriately.
   - The program needs to check if a move is valid (using `func_1`) and then perform the actual movement (using `func_2`).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid by ensuring the target pixel is not blocked or already visited and has enough connected pixels.
   - It ensures that the target pixel `(i2, j2)` is part of a connected component with at least two other pixels in the body.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find a path from the initial position to the final position.
   - For each step in the BFS, it calls `func_1` to check if the move is valid.
   - Once a valid path is found, it reconstructs the sequence of moves.

4. **Connectivity Check:**
   - `func_1` checks if the target pixel `(i2, j2)` is part of a connected component with at least two other pixels.
   - This ensures that the body remains connected after the shrink and grow operations.
   - The BFS in `func_2` ensures that only valid moves are considered, maintaining the connectivity of Amanda's body throughout the process.

5. **Movement Simulation:**
   - The BFS in `func_2` correctly simulates the movement by shrinking the body and adding new pixels while ensuring connectivity.
   - The moves are constructed based on the parent pointers in the BFS traversal.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to ensure Amanda's body remains connected during the movement. The original assessment was incorrect because it did not account for the fact that `func_1` ensures the body remains connected and `func_2` correctly simulates the movement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program correctly ensures that Amanda's body remains connected during the movement, adhering to the problem requirements.
