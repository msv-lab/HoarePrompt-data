Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a new pixel can be added to Amanda's body under the given constraints. It ensures that the new pixel is within the grid, not a blocked pixel, and has at least two adjacent pixels in Amanda's body. This function is crucial for ensuring that the body remains connected after each move.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses BFS to find a path from the final position to the initial position, considering the constraints for valid moves. It maintains a visited matrix to avoid revisiting positions and keeps track of parent nodes to reconstruct the path. This function ensures that a feasible path exists between the two positions.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, processes the initial and final grid states, and determines if Amanda can move from the initial position to the final position using the `func_2` function. It prints the appropriate output based on whether a valid sequence of moves is found.

Based on the problem description and the provided functions:
- The problem requires that Amanda's body remains connected throughout the movement, which is ensured by the `func_1` check.
- The `func_2` function uses BFS to find a valid path from the final position to the initial position, ensuring that each move is valid according to the rules.
- `func_3` correctly reads the input, processes it, and prints the appropriate output.

Since all the functions work together to ensure that Amanda can move from the initial position to the final position while maintaining the constraints, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
