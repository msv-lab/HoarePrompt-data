Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem but does not fully meet the requirements. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if a move is valid, but it does not ensure that the resulting body remains connected. This is a critical requirement as per the problem statement. Additionally, the function `func_2` does not correctly simulate the amoeboid movement because it only checks if a pixel can be added to the body but does not actually perform the shrinking and growing process correctly. Therefore, the program cannot guarantee that Amanda's body will remain connected during the movement, and thus, it may fail for certain inputs.
