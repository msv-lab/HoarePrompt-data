You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This problem has an attachment. You can use it to simulate and visualize the
movements of the amoeba.

Amoeba Amanda lives inside a rectangular grid of square pixels. Her body
occupies some of these pixels. Other pixels may be either free or blocked.
Amanda moves across the grid using the so-called amoeboid movement. In each
step of such a movement, her body first shrinks by one pixel (one pixel of the
body is removed and becomes free), and then grows at a different place (one
previously-free pixel is added to the body).

To prevent structural damage, Amanda's body always occupies a connected region
of pixels, which means that any pair of pixels forming the body can be
connected by a sequence of adjacent pixels without ever leaving the body. Two
pixels are considered adjacent if they share a common side (each pixel has at
most 4 neighbours). The body remains connected even during the movement,
including the moment after removing a pixel and before adding another one.

Your task is to help Amanda find her way around. Given her initial position
and desired final position, suggest a sequence of valid moves leading from the
former to the latter.

Illustration of sample 1 : The filled shape is the initial position, the
dotted region is the final position.

Input

The first line contains two integers r and c (1\le r,c \le 50 ) — the size of
the rectangular grid in pixels.

The next r lines contain c characters each, describing the initial position of
Amanda. Each of those characters is either a dot \texttt{.} denoting a free
pixel, an asterisk \texttt{*} denoting Amanda's body, or an \texttt{X}
denoting a blocked pixel which may never be occupied.

The next line is empty.

The next r lines describe the desired final position in the same format as the
initial position.

It is guaranteed that:

  * The number of pixels forming Amanda's body is the same in both positions, and it is at least 2. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the initial position. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the final position. 
  * The blocked pixels do not change between the descriptions of the initial and final position, their placement is exactly the same in both positions. 

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible for Amanda to go from the initial
position to the final one. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

If it is possible, on the next line print one integer m (0\le m\le 10\,000 ) —
the number of moves to execute.

The following m lines must contain four integer coordinates each: i_1 , j_1 ,
i_2 , j_2 (1\le i_1,i_2\le r , 1\le j_1,j_2\le c ). These four coordinates
specify one move, meaning that the pixel at i_1 -th row and j_1 -th column is
first removed from the body. Then, (i_2,j_2) must designate a different
location where one pixel is added.

The sequence should consist only of valid moves and after the last move,
Amanda's body should occupy the desired final position.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Under the assumptions of this problem, it can be proven that if it is possible
for Amanda to go from the initial position to the desired final one, then it
is possible to do it with at most 10\,000 moves.

    5 8
    
    .******.

Note

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a grid represented as a 2D list (`grid`), its dimensions `r` and `c`, a visited status 2D list (`visited`), and specific indices for removing and adding pixels (`i1`, `j1`, `i2`, `j2`). The function checks several conditions to determine if a new pixel can be added at position `(i2, j2)`:

1. It first checks if the new position `(i2, j2)` is within the grid boundaries. If not, it returns `False`.
2. It then checks if the new position contains a star ('*') or if it has already been visited. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
3. It counts the number of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to `(i2, j2)` that are marked with '*'. If fewer than 2 such adjacent cells exist, it returns `False`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `True`.

The function returns `True` only when the new pixel can be added according to the specified rules and conditions, and it returns `False` otherwise. This includes edge cases where the new position is out of bounds, contains a '*', or is already visited, or when there are fewer than 2 adjacent stars.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `grid`, positive integers `r` and `c` representing the dimensions of the grid, and tuples `initial_position` and `final_position` indicating the starting and ending coordinates. The function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from `final_position` to `initial_position` if one exists. If no path is found, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns a list of tuples representing the reversed sequence of coordinates forming the path from `final_position` to `initial_position`.

''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads the dimensions and contents of two grids (initial_grid and final_grid) from standard input, along with the starting and ending positions of a character represented by '*'. It then calls another function `func_2` to determine if there is a sequence of moves that transforms `initial_grid` into `final_grid` while moving the character from `initial_position` to `final_position`. If such a sequence exists, it prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the moves themselves. If no valid sequence is found, it prints "NO". The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and within the specified constraints. Edge cases include scenarios where the starting and ending positions are invalid or do not exist in the grids. If `func_2` fails to find a solution, the function will incorrectly print "NO" without any further indication.
