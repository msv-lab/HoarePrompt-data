Reasoning:
- The program consists of three main functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
- `func_1` checks if a pixel can be added to Amanda's body under certain conditions.
- `func_2` uses BFS to find a sequence of moves to transform Amanda's body from the initial position to the final position.
- `func_3` reads the input, calls `func_2` to determine if the transformation is possible, and prints the result accordingly.

To verify the correctness of the program:
1. **Initial and Final Position Check**: Both `func_2` and `func_3` correctly identify the initial and final positions of Amanda's body.
2. **Connectedness Check**: `func_1` ensures that Amanda's body remains connected after each move, which is crucial for maintaining the structure of her body.
3. **Pathfinding**: `func_2` uses BFS to explore all possible moves and ensure that the transformation from initial to final positions is valid and possible.
4. **Output Validation**: `func_3` correctly prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the moves themselves if a valid sequence is found. If no valid sequence is found, it prints "NO".

Given the provided information, all functions work together to meet the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
