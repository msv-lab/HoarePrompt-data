#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a grid represented as a 2D list (`grid`), its dimensions `r` and `c`, a visited status 2D list (`visited`), and specific indices for removing and adding pixels (`i1`, `j1`, `i2`, `j2`). The function checks several conditions to determine if a new pixel can be added at position `(i2, j2)`:

1. It first checks if the new position `(i2, j2)` is within the grid boundaries. If not, it returns `False`.
2. It then checks if the new position contains a star ('*') or if it has already been visited. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
3. It counts the number of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to `(i2, j2)` that are marked with '*'. If fewer than 2 such adjacent cells exist, it returns `False`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `True`.

The function returns `True` only when the new pixel can be added according to the specified rules and conditions, and it returns `False` otherwise. This includes edge cases where the new position is out of bounds, contains a '*', or is already visited, or when there are fewer than 2 adjacent stars.

Otherwise, it returns a list of tuples representing the reversed sequence of coordinates forming the path from `final_position` to `initial_position`.

If `moves` is a non-empty list, then `print(*move)` has been executed for each element in the original `moves` list, and all elements of `moves` have been printed. If `moves` is falsy (e.g., an empty list), the string 'NO' is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the dimensions and contents of two grids (initial_grid and final_grid) from standard input, along with the starting and ending positions of a character represented by '*'. It then calls another function `func_2` to determine if there is a sequence of moves that transforms `initial_grid` into `final_grid` while moving the character from `initial_position` to `final_position`. If such a sequence exists, it prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the moves themselves. If no valid sequence is found, it prints "NO". The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and within the specified constraints. Edge cases include scenarios where the starting and ending positions are invalid or do not exist in the grids. If `func_2` fails to find a solution, the function will incorrectly print "NO" without any further indication.
