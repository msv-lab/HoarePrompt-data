grid is a 2D list representing the rectangular grid, where each element is a string of length c containing characters '.', '*', or 'X'. r and c are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid. i1 and j1 are the row and column indices of the pixel to be removed from Amanda's body, and i2 and j2 are the row and column indices of the new pixel to be added to Amanda's body. visited is a 2D boolean list of the same dimensions as grid, indicating whether each pixel has been visited during the movement process.
