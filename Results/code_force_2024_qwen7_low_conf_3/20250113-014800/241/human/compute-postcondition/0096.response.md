The code `parent_position = parent[current_position]` updates the value of `parent_position` to the parent position of `current_position`. Given the initial states and the context, this means that `parent_position` is now the parent of `current_position`.

Since the initial states indicate that `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, and `current_position` was previously updated to `parent_position`, the new value of `parent_position` will be the parent of the previous `current_position`.

Therefore, the updated state is that `parent_position` is now the parent of the previous `current_position`.

Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates, `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions, `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, `parent_position` is the parent of the previous `current_position`, and `moves` is a list containing one additional tuple `((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))**.
