Postcondition: ***`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `c`, `initial_position` is `(i, j)`, `final_position` is `(r - 1, c)`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, and `c` must be greater than 0. If `final_grid[i][j]` equals '*', the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` remains '*'. Since there is no else part, the state of `initial_grid[i][j]` does not change in any other case.***
