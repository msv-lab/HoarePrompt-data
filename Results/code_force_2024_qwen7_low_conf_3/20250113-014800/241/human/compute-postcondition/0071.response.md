The code `print(*moves)` will print the elements of the list `moves` separated by spaces. However, the value of `moves` itself does not change. The output of the print statement will be the elements of the list, but this does not alter the state of the `moves` list.

Output State: **`moves` is a list with at least one more element remaining**
