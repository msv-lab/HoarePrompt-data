The code `initial_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `initial_position`. Given the initial state, `i` is `r - 1` and `j` is `0`. Therefore, `initial_position` is set to `(r - 1, 0)`. The values of `i`, `j`, `c`, and `final_position` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, `final_position` is `(r - 1, -1)`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`**
