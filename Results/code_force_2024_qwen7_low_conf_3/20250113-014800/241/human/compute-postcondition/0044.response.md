According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `r-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `r - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `r`.

Given that `i` is currently `r - 1`, the loop will not execute again because it will stop at `i = r - 1`.

However, if we consider the scenario where the loop does not execute (i.e., the condition `i < r` fails), then the states should reflect that the loop did not proceed further.

So, the states remain as they are:

State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `-1`, `initial_position` is undefined, `final_position` is undefined, `c` is `0`**
