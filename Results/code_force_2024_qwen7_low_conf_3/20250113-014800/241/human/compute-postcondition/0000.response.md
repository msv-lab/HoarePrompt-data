`r` and `c` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `r` and `c` will now hold the integer values entered by the user, and the initial values of `initial_grid`, `final_grid`, `initial_position`, and `final_position` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_grid` and `final_grid` are 2D lists of strings, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively; `r` and `c` are the integer values entered by the user.**
