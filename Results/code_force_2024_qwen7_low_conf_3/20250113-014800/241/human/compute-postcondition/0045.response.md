Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial value**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(c)`, which means the loop variable `j` will take values from 0 to `c-1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `c` is at least 1 (since `range(c)` will generate values from 0 to `c-1`). If `c` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `i` is `r - 1`: This is the current value of `i`.
   - `j` is `-1`: This is the current value of `j`.
   - `initial_position` is undefined: We don't need to change this since it's not related to the loop condition.
   - `final_position` is undefined: Similarly, we don't need to change this either.
   - `c` is `0`: This is the value of `c`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `c` is currently `0`, the loop will not execute because `range(0)` generates no values.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `c` must be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **State the final adjusted state**:
   - `i` is `r - 1`
   - `j` is `-1`
   - `c` must be greater than or equal to 1

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
**`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `-1`, `c` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
