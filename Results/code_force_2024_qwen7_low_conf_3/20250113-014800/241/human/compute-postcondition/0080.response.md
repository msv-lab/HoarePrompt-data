Output State: **`i` is its original value, `j` is its original value, `q` contains all tuples `(ni, nj)` for which `func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i, j, ni, nj)` returned `True`, `visited[ni][nj]` is `True` for all such tuples, `parent[ni, nj]` is set to `(i, j)` for all such tuples, and no other elements of `visited` or `parent` are changed.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over four possible directions: right, left, down, and up.
2. **Condition Check**: For each direction, it checks if `func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i, j, ni, nj)` returns `True`.
3. **Action if True**: If the condition is true, it updates `visited[ni][nj]` to `True`, adds `(ni, nj)` to `q`, and sets `parent[ni, nj]` to `(i, j)`.
4. **No Change if False**: If the condition is false, no changes are made to `visited[ni][nj]`, `q`, or `parent`.

After all iterations, `q` will contain all the valid tuples `(ni, nj)` that satisfied the condition `func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i, j, ni, nj)`. `visited[ni][nj]` will be `True` for these tuples, and `parent[ni, nj]` will be set to `(i, j)` for these tuples. No other changes are made to `visited` or `parent` outside of these conditions.

If the loop does not execute even once, `q` remains unchanged, and `visited[ni][nj]` and `parent[ni, nj]` remain unchanged.
