The code assigns the value of `i, j` to `initial_position`. The variables `i` and `j` are part of the tuple `initial_position`, but their individual values do not change. Therefore, the only change is that `initial_position` now holds the coordinates `i, j`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `initial_grid[0][j]` is '*', `initial_position` is (0, j)**
