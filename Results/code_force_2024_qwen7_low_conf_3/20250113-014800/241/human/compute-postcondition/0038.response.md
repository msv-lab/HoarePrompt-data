Let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is `r - 1`
  - `j` is `c`
  - `initial_position` is `(i, j)`
  - `final_position` is `(r - 1, c)`
  - `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows
  - `c` must be greater than 0
  - The condition for `initial_grid[i][j]` is that if `final_grid[i][j]` equals '*', then `initial_grid[i][j]` remains '*'. Otherwise, the state of `initial_grid[i][j]` does not change.

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `c-1`.
2. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `r - 1`
   - `j` is `c`
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `0` (assuming `c > 0`).

### Adjusting States
- `i` remains `r - 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `j` changes from `c` to `0` in the next iteration.
- `initial_position` becomes `(r - 1, 0)` because `i` remains `r - 1` and `j` changes to `0`.
- `final_position` remains `(r - 1, c)` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `initial_grid` remains unchanged because the condition for changing its value (`final_grid[i][j] == '*'`) has not been met yet (since `j` was `c` in the previous iteration and now changes to `0`).

### Final State
State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`, `final_position` is `(r - 1, c)`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, and `c` must be greater than 0.**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`, `final_position` is `(r - 1, c)`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, and `c` must be greater than 0.**
