The line `initial_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `initial_position`. Given the initial state, `i` is `r - 1` and `j` is `0`. Therefore, `initial_position` is updated to `(r - 1, 0)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`, `final_position` is `(r - 1, c)`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, and `c` must be greater than 0.**
