The code `final_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `final_position`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `initial_position` is set based on the condition in `initial_grid`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `j` is also unchanged because it is not specified how `j` is determined in the initial state. Therefore, `final_position` is set to `(0, j)`, where `j` is the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 0, `initial_position` is (0, j), the current value of `final_grid[0][j]` is '*', and `final_position` is (0, j)**
