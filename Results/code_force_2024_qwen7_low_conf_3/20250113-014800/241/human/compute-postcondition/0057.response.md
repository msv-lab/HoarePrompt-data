According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, and `final_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from `0` to `1` (assuming `c` is at least `2`). Therefore, the new state will be:

State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `1`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, and `final_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`**
