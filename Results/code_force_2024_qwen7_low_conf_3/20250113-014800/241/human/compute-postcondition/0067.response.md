The code `print(len(moves))` prints the length of the `moves` list. Since `moves` is the result of calling `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)` and is truthy, it means `moves` is a non-empty list. The initial state does not provide the exact number of elements in `moves`, but it is known that `moves` is non-empty. Therefore, the length of `moves` is at least 1.

Output State: **`i` is `r`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is either undefined or the position of the last `'*'` found in `initial_grid`, `final_position` is either undefined or the position of the last `'*'` found in `final_grid`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` is a non-negative integer, `moves` is a non-empty list, print statement outputs 'YES', length of `moves` is at least 1.**
