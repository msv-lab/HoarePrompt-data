Postcondition: ***`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, c - 1)`, `final_position` is `(r - 1, c - 1)`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, and `c` must be greater than 0. The value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', and after the execution, the value of `final_grid[i][j]` remains '*', indicating no change.***
