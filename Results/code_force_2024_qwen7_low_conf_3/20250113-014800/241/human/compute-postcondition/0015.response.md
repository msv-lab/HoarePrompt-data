The code `initial_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(0, j)` to the variable `initial_position`. Here, `i` is 0 from the initial state, so `initial_position` becomes `(0, j)`. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as it is. The other variables `initial_grid`, `final_grid`, and `final_position` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows; `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows; `c` must be greater than 1; if `final_grid[0][1]` is '*', then `initial_position` and `final_position` are both (0, 1), otherwise `initial_position` is (0, `j`).**
