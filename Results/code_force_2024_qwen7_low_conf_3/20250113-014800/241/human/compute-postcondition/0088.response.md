The code `parent_position = parent[current_position]` assigns the value of the `parent` dictionary at the key `current_position` to the variable `parent_position`. This means that `parent_position` now holds the value of the parent position of `current_position`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates, `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions, `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, all positions reachable from `final_position` and all positions that can reach `initial_position` are marked in `visited` and `parent`, `current_position` is one of the keys in the `parent` dictionary but not equal to `initial_position`, `parent_position` is the parent position of `current_position`, and `moves` is an empty list.**
