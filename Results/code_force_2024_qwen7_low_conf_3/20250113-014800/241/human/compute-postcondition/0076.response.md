The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not change the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `initial_position`, `final_position`, `initial_grid`, `final_grid`, `c`, or `moves`. Therefore, the only change is the output of the string 'NO'.

Output State: **`i` is `r`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is either undefined or the position of the last `'*'` found in `initial_grid`, `final_position` is either undefined or the position of the last `'*'` found in `final_grid`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` is a non-negative integer, `moves` is the result of calling `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)`, and the `moves` variable is falsy; the string 'NO' is printed to the console.**
