Functionality: **The function reads the dimensions and contents of two grids (initial_grid and final_grid) from standard input, along with the starting and ending positions of a character represented by '*'. It then calls another function `func_2` to determine if there is a sequence of moves that transforms `initial_grid` into `final_grid` while moving the character from `initial_position` to `final_position`. If such a sequence exists, it prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the moves themselves. If no valid sequence is found, it prints "NO". The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and within the specified constraints. Edge cases include scenarios where the starting and ending positions are invalid or do not exist in the grids. If `func_2` fails to find a solution, the function will incorrectly print "NO" without any further indication.**
