According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `c-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values are as follows:
- `i` is `r - 1`
- `j` is `-1`
- `c` is greater than or equal to 1
- `final_position` is `(r - 1, -1)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will become `0`.

Since the loop condition depends on `j` being within the range `[0, c-1]`, if `j` becomes `0`, the loop will execute again.

The state does not change for `i`, `c`, and `final_position` based on the given conditions. Therefore, the only state that changes is `j`.

State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, and `final_position` is `(r - 1, -1)`**
