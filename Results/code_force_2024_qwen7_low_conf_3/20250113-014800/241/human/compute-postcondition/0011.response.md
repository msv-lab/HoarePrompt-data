Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 0, and if `initial_grid[0][j]` is '*', then `initial_position` is (0, j), and the current value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', and `i` remains 0**
