The code snippet `final_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `final_position`. According to the initial state, `i` is `r - 1` and `j` is `c`. Therefore, `final_position` is updated to `(r - 1, c)`.

The other variables (`initial_position`, `initial_grid`, `r`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `c`, `initial_position` is `(i, j)`, `final_position` is `(r - 1, c)`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 0, and the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` remains '*'**
