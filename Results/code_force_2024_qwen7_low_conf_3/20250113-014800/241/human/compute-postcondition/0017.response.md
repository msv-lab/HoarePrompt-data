The code sets `final_position` to the tuple `(i, j)`. This means that the value of `final_position` is updated to `(i, j)` from its previous value. The initial values of `i` and `j` are 0 and 1 respectively since `initial_position` is set to (0, 1) when `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 1, `initial_position` is (0, 1), `final_position` is (0, 1)**
