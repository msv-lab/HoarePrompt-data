The code sets `final_position` to `None`. This means that the value of `final_position` is now explicitly set to `None`, without changing the values of any other variables.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings obtained from user input for r rows; `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings obtained from user input for r rows; `initial_position` is `None`; `final_position` is `None`; `r` and `c` are unchanged.**
