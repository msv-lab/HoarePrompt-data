To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions for the `while` loop:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `current_position != initial_position`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid.
   - `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid.
   - `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates.
   - `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions.
   - `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`.
   - `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position.
   - All positions reachable from `final_position` and all positions that can reach `initial_position` are marked in `visited` and `parent`.
   - `current_position` is now equal to `parent_position`.
   - `parent_position` is updated to the parent position of `current_position`.
   - `moves` is a list containing one additional tuple `((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))`.

For the loop to continue, `current_position` must still not be equal to `initial_position`. This means we need to ensure that the condition `current_position != initial_position` remains true.

Given that `current_position` is set to `parent_position` and `parent_position` is updated to the parent position of `current_position`, we need to ensure that `parent_position` is not yet `initial_position`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `parent_position` is not yet equal to `initial_position`.

**State**: **`grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates, `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions, `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, `parent_position` must not be equal to `initial_position`, and `moves` is a list containing one additional tuple `((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))**.
