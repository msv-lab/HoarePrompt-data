Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 1. If `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', then `initial_position` and `final_position` are both (0, 1). Otherwise, `initial_position` is (0, `j`).***
