The code `initial_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `initial_position`. The values of `i` and `j` are known: `i` is `r - 1` and `j` is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `1`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, `final_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, 1)`**
