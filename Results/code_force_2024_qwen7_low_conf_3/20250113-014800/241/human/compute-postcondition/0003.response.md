The code assigns a new value to `final_grid` by taking input for `r` rows. Each row is taken as input and stored in `final_grid`. The other variables (`initial_grid`, `initial_position`, `final_position`, `r`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings obtained from user input for r rows; `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings obtained from user input for r rows; `initial_position` is unchanged, `final_position` is unchanged, `r` and `c` are unchanged.**
