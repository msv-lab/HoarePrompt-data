The code appends a new tuple to the `moves` list, where the tuple contains four elements: `parent_position[0] + 1`, `parent_position[1] + 1`, `current_position[0] + 1`, and `current_position[1] + 1`. These are calculated using the values of `parent_position` and `current_position` at the time of execution. The `moves` list now includes this new tuple.

Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates, `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions, `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, `parent_position` is the parent of the previous `current_position`, and `moves` is a list containing one additional tuple `((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1), (parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))**
