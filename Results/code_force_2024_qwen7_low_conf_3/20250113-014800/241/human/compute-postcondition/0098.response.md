The code sets `current_position` to `parent_position`. This means that the value of `current_position` will be updated to whatever the value of `parent_position` was before this line of code. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates, `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions, `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, `parent_position` is the parent of the previous `current_position`, and `current_position` is now equal to `parent_position`.**
