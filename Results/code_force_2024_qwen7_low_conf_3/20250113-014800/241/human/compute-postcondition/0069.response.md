The code snippet `print(*move)` simply prints the elements in the list `move` using the unpacking operator. It does not change the values of any variables, it only outputs them. The initial state of `move` is not provided, but the code will print whatever is currently in `move`. Since no new assignment or modification is done, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`print(*move)` is executed and the elements of `move` are printed. The values of `move` and other variables remain the same.**
