The `input()` function is called without any argument, which means it will take user input but does not assign it to any variable. Since no assignment is made, the variables `initial_grid`, `final_grid`, `initial_position`, `final_position`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings obtained from user input for r rows; `final_grid` is unchanged, `initial_position` is unchanged, `final_position` is unchanged, `r` and `c` are unchanged.**
