The code `final_position = i, j` updates the value of `final_position` to be the tuple `(i, j)`. Given the initial state where `i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, and `c` is greater than or equal to 1, the value of `final_position` is updated to `(r - 1, 0)`.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, and `final_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`**
