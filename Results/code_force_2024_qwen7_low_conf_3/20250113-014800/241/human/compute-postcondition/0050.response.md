The code `final_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `final_position`. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are known (`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `-1`). Therefore, `final_position` will be set to the tuple `(r - 1, -1)`. The states of the other variables (`c` and `final_grid[i][j]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `-1`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, `final_position` is `(r - 1, -1)`, and the value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'**
