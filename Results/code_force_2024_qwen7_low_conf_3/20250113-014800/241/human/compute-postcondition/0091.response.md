Let's break down the given information and the requirements of the `while` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid.
- `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid.
- `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates.
- `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions.
- `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`.
- `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position.
- All positions reachable from `final_position` and all positions that can reach `initial_position` are marked in `visited` and `parent`.
- `current_position` is now equal to `parent_position`.
- `parent_position` is the parent position of `current_position`.
- `moves` is a list containing one tuple `((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while current_position != initial_position:`. This means the loop continues as long as `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`.

### Analysis:
To proceed to the next iteration, we need `current_position` to be different from `initial_position`. 

Given that `current_position` is set to `parent_position` at the start of the loop, the loop will continue as long as `parent_position` is not equal to `initial_position`. Therefore, we don't need to adjust `current_position` or `parent_position` directly. Instead, we need to ensure that the conditions leading up to the current state allow for `parent_position` to be different from `initial_position`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot know the exact changes made inside the loop, but the essential requirement is that the next `current_position` should still be different from `initial_position`.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed to the given states since the loop condition is already satisfied by the current state where `current_position` is different from `initial_position`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates, `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions, `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, all positions reachable from `final_position` and all positions that can reach `initial_position` are marked in `visited` and `parent`, `current_position` is now equal to `parent_position`, `parent_position` is the parent position of `current_position`, and `moves` is a list containing one tuple `((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))**
