The line `initial_position = None` assigns the value `None` to the variable `initial_position`. This overwrites the previous value of `initial_position`, which was unchanged in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings obtained from user input for r rows; `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings obtained from user input for r rows; `initial_position` is `None`; `final_position` is unchanged, `r` and `c` are unchanged.**
