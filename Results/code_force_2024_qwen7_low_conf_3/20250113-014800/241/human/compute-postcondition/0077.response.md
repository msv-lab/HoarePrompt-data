Postcondition: ***`i` is `r`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is either undefined or the position of the last `'*'` found in `initial_grid`, `final_position` is either undefined or the position of the last `'*'` found in `final_grid`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` is a non-negative integer, and `moves` is the result of calling `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)`. If `moves` is a non-empty list, then `print(*move)` has been executed for each element in the original `moves` list, and all elements of `moves` have been printed. If `moves` is falsy (e.g., an empty list), the string 'NO' is printed to the console.***
