The code `print(*moves)` prints the elements of the list `moves` using the unpacking operator `*`. This operation does not modify the list `moves` itself; it only outputs its contents. The output of the print statement will be the elements of the list `moves`, separated by spaces.

Output State: **`moves` is a list with at least two more elements remaining; the elements of `moves` have been printed**
