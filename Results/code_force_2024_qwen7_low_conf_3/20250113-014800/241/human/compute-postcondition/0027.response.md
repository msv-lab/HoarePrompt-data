Postcondition: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is either undefined or (0, c - 1), `final_position` is either undefined or (0, c - 1), `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 0, and the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', meaning the cell at position `(i, j)` in the `initial_grid` contains a '*' character**
