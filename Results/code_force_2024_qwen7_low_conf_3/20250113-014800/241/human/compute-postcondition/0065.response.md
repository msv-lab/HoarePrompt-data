Postcondition: **`i` is `r`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is either undefined or the position of the last `'*'` found in `initial_grid`, `final_position` is either undefined or the position of the last `'*'` found in `final_grid`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` is a non-negative integer, `moves` is the result of calling `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)`, and `moves` is truthy**
