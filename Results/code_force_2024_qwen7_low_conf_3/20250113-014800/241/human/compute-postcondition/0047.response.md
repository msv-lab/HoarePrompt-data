The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variable `initial_position`. This means that `initial_position` will store a tuple containing the values of `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition that `c` must be greater than or equal to 1 also remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `-1`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, -1)`**
