Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 0. If `final_grid[0][j]` is '*', then `initial_position` and `final_position` are both (0, j). Otherwise, the position of `initial_position` remains unchanged.***
