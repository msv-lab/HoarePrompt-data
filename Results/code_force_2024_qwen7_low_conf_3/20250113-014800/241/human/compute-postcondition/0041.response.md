The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `final_position`. Initially, `i` is `r - 1`, and `j` is `0`. After the assignment, `final_position` will hold these values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `0`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`, `final_position` is `(r - 1, 0)`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, and `c` must be greater than 0.**
