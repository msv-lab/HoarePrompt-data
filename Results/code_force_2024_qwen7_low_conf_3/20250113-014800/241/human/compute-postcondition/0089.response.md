The code appends a tuple to the `moves` list. The tuple contains the coordinates of `parent_position` shifted by `(1, 1)` and the coordinates of `current_position` shifted by `(1, 1)`. The values of `parent_position` and `current_position` are already known through their respective definitions. The `moves` list was initially empty, so after appending the new tuple, it now contains one element.

- `parent_position` is the parent position of `current_position`.
- `current_position` is a key in the `parent` dictionary.
- `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position.
- `moves` is updated to contain one tuple: `((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates, `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions, `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, all positions reachable from `final_position` and all positions that can reach `initial_position` are marked in `visited` and `parent`, `current_position` is one of the keys in the `parent` dictionary but not equal to `initial_position`, `parent_position` is the parent position of `current_position`, and `moves` is a list containing one tuple `((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1), (current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))**.
