The code `final_position = i, j` updates the `final_position` variable to be a tuple containing the values of `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` are `r - 1` and `1`, respectively. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `1`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, and `final_position` is `(r - 1, 1)`**
