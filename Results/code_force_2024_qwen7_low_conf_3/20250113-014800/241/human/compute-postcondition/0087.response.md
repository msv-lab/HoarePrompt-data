To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop and the given state.

The loop condition is:
```python
while current_position != initial_position:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current state before the loop:
- `grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid.
- `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid.
- `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates.
- `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions.
- `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`.
- `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position.
- All positions reachable from `final_position` and all positions that can reach `initial_position` are marked in `visited` and `parent`.
- `current_position` is `final_position`.
- `moves` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `current_position != initial_position` must be true. Since `current_position` is currently set to `final_position`, we need to change `current_position` to something other than `initial_position`.

Let's assume the algorithm has found a path from `final_position` to `initial_position`. The next step would be to move `current_position` to one of its parent positions. Therefore, we need to adjust `current_position` to be one of the keys in the `parent` dictionary, ensuring it is not equal to `initial_position`.

Thus, the adjustment needed is to ensure `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`.

State: **`grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid, `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples indicating the starting and ending coordinates, `visited` is a 2D list marking the visited positions, `q` is a deque containing all positions that can be reached from `final_position` based on the movement directions specified by `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, `parent` is a dictionary mapping each position in `q` to its parent position, all positions reachable from `final_position` and all positions that can reach `initial_position` are marked in `visited` and `parent`, and `current_position` is one of the keys in the `parent` dictionary but not equal to `initial_position`; `moves` is an empty list.**

This ensures that the loop can execute at least once more by changing `current_position` to a valid position in the `parent` dictionary that is not equal to `initial_position`.
