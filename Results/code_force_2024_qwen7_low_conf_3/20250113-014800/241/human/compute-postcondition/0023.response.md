Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `initial_position` is (0, `j + 1`), `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, and `c` must be greater than 1. If `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', then `final_position` is (0, `j + 1`). Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `initial_position`, `initial_grid`, and `final_grid` remain unchanged.***
