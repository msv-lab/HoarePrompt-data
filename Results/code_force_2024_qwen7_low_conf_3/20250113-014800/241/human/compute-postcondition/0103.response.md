Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `grid`, positive integers `r` and `c` representing the dimensions of the grid, and tuples `initial_position` and `final_position` indicating the starting and ending coordinates. The function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from `final_position` to `initial_position` if one exists. If no path is found, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns a list of tuples representing the reversed sequence of coordinates forming the path from `final_position` to `initial_position`.**

- The function first initializes a `visited` list to keep track of visited positions and a deque `q` to store positions to be explored. It then starts the BFS from `initial_position`.
- During the BFS, it checks if the current position is the `final_position`. If so, the loop breaks.
- For each position, it explores all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and marks new positions as visited if they are within bounds and not blocked.
- After the BFS loop, if the `final_position` is not found in the `parent` dictionary, the function returns `None`.
- If a path is found, it reconstructs the path using the `parent` dictionary and returns the reversed path as a list of tuples.
- Potential edge cases include scenarios where the `final_position` is not reachable from the `initial_position` due to blocked pixels or the grid's boundaries. In such cases, the function correctly returns `None`.
