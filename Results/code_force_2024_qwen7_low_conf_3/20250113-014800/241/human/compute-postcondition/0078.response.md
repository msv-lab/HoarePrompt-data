The function `func_3` accepts the following parameters:
- `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50.
- `initial_grid` and `final_grid` are 2D lists of strings, where each string represents a row of the grid and contains characters '.', '*', and 'X'.
- `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively. The coordinates are zero-based indices, with (0, 0) being the top-left corner of the grid.

Based on the provided cases, the function returns a specific value or message depending on the input parameters. However, since no specific return values or conditions are explicitly stated, we can only describe the parameters accepted by the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r` and `c` (both integers within the range 1 to 50), `initial_grid` and `final_grid` (2D lists of strings containing '.', '*', and 'X'), and `initial_position` and `final_position` (tuples representing coordinates).**
