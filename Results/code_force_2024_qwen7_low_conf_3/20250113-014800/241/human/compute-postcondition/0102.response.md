The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `grid`, `r`, `c`, `initial_position`, and `final_position`. 

- `grid` is a 2D list of strings representing a rectangular grid, where each string represents a row of the grid and contains '.', '*', or 'X'.
- `r` and `c` are positive integers indicating the dimensions of the grid.
- `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples of two positive integers indicating the starting and ending coordinates of Amanda's body as (row_index, column_index).

Based on the given cases:

- Case_1: The program returns `None`.
- Case_2: The program returns `moves`, which is a list containing a reversed sequence of tuples representing the path from `final_position` to `initial_position`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a grid represented as a 2D list of strings, along with its dimensions and the positions of Amanda's initial and final positions, and either return `None` or return a list of tuples representing the path from `final_position` to `initial_position` in reverse order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `grid`, positive integers `r` and `c`, and tuples `initial_position` and `final_position`. It returns `None` or a list of tuples representing the reversed path from `final_position` to `initial_position`.**
