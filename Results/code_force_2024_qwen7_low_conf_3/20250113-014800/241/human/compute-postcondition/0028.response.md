The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variable `initial_position`. Before this assignment, `initial_position` is either undefined or `(0, c - 1)`. After the assignment, `initial_position` will be updated to `(i, j)`.

- `i` is `r - 1`
- `j` is `c - 1`

Therefore, `initial_position` will be `(r - 1, c - 1)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, c - 1)`, `final_position` is either undefined or (0, c - 1), `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 0, and the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'**
