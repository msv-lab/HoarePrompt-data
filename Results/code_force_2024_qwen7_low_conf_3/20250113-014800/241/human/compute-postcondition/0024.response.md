Output State: **`i` is `r`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is either undefined or (0, c - 1), `final_position` is either undefined or (0, c - 1), `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, and `c` is a non-negative integer.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column `j` from 0 to `c-1`.
- For each column `j`, the loop checks if `initial_grid[i][j]` or `final_grid[i][j]` is `'*'`.
- After the loop completes all iterations, `j` will be `c-1` because the loop increments `j` from 0 to `c-1`.
- `i` starts at 0 and remains 0 throughout the loop since the loop only increments `j`.
- `initial_position` and `final_position` will be updated to (0, j) if `'*'` is found in `initial_grid` or `final_grid` respectively for any `j`. If no `'*'` is found in either grid for all `j`, then these positions will remain undefined.
- The conditions for the loop to execute `c` times are met when `c` is a non-negative integer.
- The values of `initial_grid` and `final_grid` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
