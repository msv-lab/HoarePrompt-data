The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `final_position`. Given that `i` is `r - 1` and `j` is `c - 1`, `final_position` is now explicitly set to `(r - 1, c - 1)`.

The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `initial_position` is still `(r - 1, c - 1)`
- `initial_grid` remains a 2D list of strings with `r` rows
- `final_grid` remains a 2D list of strings with `r` rows
- The value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is still '*'
- The current value of `final_grid[i][j]` is still '*'

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `r - 1`, `j` is `c - 1`, `initial_position` is `(r - 1, c - 1)`, `final_position` is `(r - 1, c - 1)`, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings with `r` rows, `c` must be greater than 0, the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', and the current value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'**
