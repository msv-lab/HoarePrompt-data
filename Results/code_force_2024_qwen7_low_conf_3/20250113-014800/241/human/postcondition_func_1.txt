The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `grid`, positive integers `r` and `c` representing the dimensions of the grid, and tuples `initial_position` and `final_position` indicating the starting and ending coordinates. The function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from `final_position` to `initial_position` if one exists. If no path is found, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns a list of tuples representing the reversed sequence of coordinates forming the path from `final_position` to `initial_position`.
