Precondition: **r and c are integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50. initial_grid and final_grid are 2D lists of strings, where each string represents a row of the grid and contains characters '.', '*', and 'X'. initial_position and final_position are tuples representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively. The coordinates are zero-based indices, with (0, 0) being the top-left corner of the grid.**
