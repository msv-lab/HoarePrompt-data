The code `min_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` to `min_idx`. Given that `i` is 4, `min_idx` will be updated to 4. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is `a[4]`, `min_idx` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, `k` is either decreased by `2 * (a[2] - min_)` or reduced to `k % 2`, `trg` is `4 * (a[4] - min_), `k` is `k - 4 * (a[4] - min_)**
