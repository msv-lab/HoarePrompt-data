The code appends `remaining_coins` to the `remaining_cards` list. Given the initial state, `remaining_cards` is either a list with the third element as `3` or a list excluding the third element and all `3`s. In both cases, `remaining_coins` is added to this list.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The initial state is:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers
   - `coins` is a non-negative integer
   - `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `num_cards * n`
   - `score` is `num_cards * n`
   - `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`
   - `remaining_cards` is `[a, b, d, e, ...]` if `3` is the third element, or the original list excluding the third element and all 3s
   - `num_cards` is the second element of `cards`

2. The code appends `remaining_coins` to `remaining_cards`. Since `remaining_coins` is a specific value derived from `coins` and `n`, and `remaining_cards` is a list, appending `remaining_coins` will add this specific value to the list.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `num_cards * n`, `score` is `num_cards * n`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `remaining_cards` is `[a, b, d, e, ..., remaining_coins]` if `3` is the third element, or the original list excluding the third element and all 3s with `remaining_coins` appended, `num_cards` is the second element of `cards`**
