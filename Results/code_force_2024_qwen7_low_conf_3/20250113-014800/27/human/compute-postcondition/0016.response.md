The code updates the value of `remaining_coins` by subtracting `(n - num_cards)` from the current value of `coins`. Given the initial state, we know that `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `num_cards` is `cards[1]`. Therefore, `remaining_coins` is updated to `coins - (n - num_cards)`.

Let's denote the initial value of `coins` as `C`, `n` as `N`, and `num_cards` as `NC`. The updated value of `remaining_coins` is:

\[ \text{remaining\_coins} = C - (N - NC) = C - N + NC \]

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `score` remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC`, and `remaining_cards` remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`.**
