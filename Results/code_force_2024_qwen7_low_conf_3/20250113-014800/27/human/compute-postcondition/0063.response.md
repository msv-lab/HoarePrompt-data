Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is greater than 0
   - `outs` is now `[tot]`
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers
   - `min_` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0] + k`
   - `min_idx` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is 0 or `k` is greater than or equal to `trg`
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `trg` is `second_min_a - min_a`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration and needs to be incremented to 2, `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Remaining States:**
   - `total` remains greater than 0.
   - `outs` remains `[tot]`.
   - `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
   - `min_` remains the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0] + k`.
   - `min_idx` remains either 0 or 1.
   - `trg` remains `second_min_a - min_a`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0] + k`, `min_idx` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `trg` is `second_min_a - min_a`.**
