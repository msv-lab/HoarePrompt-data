According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values are as follows:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `score`
- `score` is `cards[1] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains `C - N + NC`
- `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`

For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 and checked against `n + 1`. Since `i` was 2, it will become 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 3 and `n` must still be greater than 0.

The other states (`cards`, `coins`, `max_score`, `score`, `remaining_coins`, and `remaining_cards`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `score`, `score` is `cards[1] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains `C - N + NC`, `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`.**
