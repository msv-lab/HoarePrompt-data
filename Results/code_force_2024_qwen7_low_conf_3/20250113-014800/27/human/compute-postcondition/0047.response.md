`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which converts them to integers. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`, `min_` is the smallest value in the list `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the last update, and `n` and `k` are input integers.**
