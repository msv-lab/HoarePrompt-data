The code `max_score = max(max_score, score)` updates `max_score` to be the maximum value between the current `max_score` and `score`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state includes that `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `num_cards * n`, and `score` is `score + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, these relationships still hold true, but their exact values are not specified. However, `max_score` is now updated to reflect the maximum of its previous value and `score`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `num_cards * n`, `score` is `score + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `remaining_cards` is `[a, b, d, e, ..., remaining_coins]` if `3` is the third element, or the original list excluding the third element and all 3s with `remaining_coins` appended, `num_cards` is the second element of `cards`, `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `score`**.
