The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `min_`. Since `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. The value of `min_` changes to `a[1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is `a[1]`, `min_idx` is 0 or `-1`, `k` is `k - (a[1] - min_)`, `trg` is `a[1] - min_`**
