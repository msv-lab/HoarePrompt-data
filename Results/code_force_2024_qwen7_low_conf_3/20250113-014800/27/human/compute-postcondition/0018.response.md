The code snippet filters out the integer `i` from the list `cards`. Given that `i` is 2, `remaining_cards` will be a list of all integers in `cards` except for 2.

- The initial state of `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `remaining_cards` is updated to exclude the integer 2 from `cards`.

Since the exact contents of `cards` are not specified, let's denote the list as `cards = [a1, a2, ..., an]` where `a2` (the second element) is 2. After removing 2 from the list, the updated list `remaining_cards` will be `[a1, a3, ..., an]` assuming no other elements are 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `score` is `cards[1] * n`, `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC`, `remaining_cards` is a list of `cards` excluding 2.**
