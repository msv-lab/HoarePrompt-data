`k` is decremented by the value of `trg`. The value of `trg` is defined as `a[1] - min_`. Since `k` is reset to its initial value in the initial state, we need to subtract `a[1] - min_` from `k`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is unchanged, `min_idx` is 0 or `-1`, `k` is `k - (a[1] - min_)`, `trg` is `a[1] - min_`**
