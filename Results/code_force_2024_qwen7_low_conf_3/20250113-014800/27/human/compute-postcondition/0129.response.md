The code `min_ += k // n` updates the value of `min_` by adding the integer division of `k` by `n` to its current value. Given the initial state, `min_` is the smallest element in `a` that can be reduced as much as possible, `min_idx` is the index of `min_`, `k` is greater than 0, and `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1`.

Let's denote `k // n` as `k_n`. Since `k` is greater than 0, `k_n` is a non-negative integer. After the operation, `min_` will be updated to `min_ + k_n`.

The output state is:
- `outs` remains `[a[0], a[0]]`.
- `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // n`.
- `min_idx` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `min_` is `min_ + k // n`, `min_idx` is `n - 1`**
