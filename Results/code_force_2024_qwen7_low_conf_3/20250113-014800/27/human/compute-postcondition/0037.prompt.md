You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cards is a list of n integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, and coins is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards. Each integer in cards is between 1 and 10^12, inclusive, and n is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(cards, coins):
    n = len(cards)
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        num_cards = cards[i - 1]
        
        if num_cards > 0:
            remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
            if remaining_coins >= 0:
                score = num_cards * n
                remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]
                remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)
                score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)
                max_score = max(max_score, score)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `cards` is a list of \( n \) integers representing the initial number of cards of each type.
    #- `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards.
    #- `max_score` is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for i in range(1, n + 1):
    #    num_cards = cards[i - 1]
    #    if num_cards > 0:
    #        remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
    #        if remaining_coins >= 0:
    #            score = num_cards * n
    #            remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]
    #            remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)
    #            score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)
    #            max_score = max(max_score, score)
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **Understanding the Loop Logic:**
    #   - The loop iterates over each index \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
    #   - For each iteration, it checks if the number of cards of the current type (`num_cards`) is greater than 0.
    #   - If `num_cards` is greater than 0, it calculates the remaining coins after buying \( n - num_cards \) more cards.
    #   - If the remaining coins are non-negative, it calculates the score based on the current number of cards and the function `func_1`.
    #   - It updates `max_score` with the maximum of the current `max_score` and the calculated `score`.
    #
    #2. **Final State After All Iterations:**
    #   - After all iterations, the loop will have considered each type of card (from 1 to \( n \)) where the number of cards is greater than 0.
    #   - The `max_score` will be the highest score achieved across all iterations where the conditions were met.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #
    #- `i` will be \( n \) because the loop will iterate up to \( n \) if all conditions are met.
    #- `n` must be greater than 0.
    #- `cards` will remain the same as the initial list since no modifications are made to the original list inside the loop.
    #- `coins` will remain the same as the initial value since no modifications are made to the original value inside the loop.
    #- `max_score` will be the highest score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met.
    return max_score
    #max_score is the maximum score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `cards` of `n` integers and a non-negative integer `coins`. It returns `max_score`, the maximum score obtained under the given conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: max_score is the maximum score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
