You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string, 'str' has 3 or more characters
```
eturn str
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns string 'str' that has 3 or more characters **


Example2:
Initial State: `numbers` is an empty list, `total` is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `average` is equal to `total / count`
```
return A
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns average whuih is equal to total/count , where total is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list**

Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
return n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the program returns either 4 or 6.
Output State: **The program returns 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is  greater than 3 , `z` is 0
```
retrun y+x
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`y' is 0 and 'x' is one so the program returns  0+1=1.
Output State: **`The program returns y that is greater than 3 plus 1**

Example4:
Initial State: `count' contains the number of numbers greater than 1 in the list `numbers`, 'numbers' is a list of integers, 'total' is 0
```
retrun count
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
Output State: **`The program returns the number of integers greater than 1 in list 'numbers' **


Your Task:
Initial State: Let's analyze the given loop and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `cards` is a list of \( n \) integers representing the initial number of cards of each type.
- `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards.
- `max_score` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    num_cards = cards[i - 1]
    if num_cards > 0:
        remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
        if remaining_coins >= 0:
            score = num_cards * n
            remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]
            remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)
            score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)
            max_score = max(max_score, score)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over each index \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each iteration, it checks if the number of cards of the current type (`num_cards`) is greater than 0.
   - If `num_cards` is greater than 0, it calculates the remaining coins after buying \( n - num_cards \) more cards.
   - If the remaining coins are non-negative, it calculates the score based on the current number of cards and the function `func_1`.
   - It updates `max_score` with the maximum of the current `max_score` and the calculated `score`.

2. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - After all iterations, the loop will have considered each type of card (from 1 to \( n \)) where the number of cards is greater than 0.
   - The `max_score` will be the highest score achieved across all iterations where the conditions were met.

### Final Output State:

- `i` will be \( n \) because the loop will iterate up to \( n \) if all conditions are met.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `cards` will remain the same as the initial list since no modifications are made to the original list inside the loop.
- `coins` will remain the same as the initial value since no modifications are made to the original value inside the loop.
- `max_score` will be the highest score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State:**
- `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met.
```
return max_score

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. Any variable or value that is included in the return, describe all the information we have for it.
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
