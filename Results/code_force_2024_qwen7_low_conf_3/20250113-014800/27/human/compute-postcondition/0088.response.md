First, let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state:

- Initial State: 
  - `t` is a positive integer greater than 1
  - `outs` is `[tot]`
  - `a` is a sorted list of integers
  - `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations
  - `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value
  - `n` is an integer greater than 1
  - `i` is \( n-1 \)
  - `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \)

The code snippet updates `tot` based on the following expression:
```python
tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k
```

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1)`: This part calculates a term related to `min_`.
   - `(n - 1 - min_idx)`: This subtracts the index difference from \( n-1 \).
   - `+ k`: Adds the value of `k` to the total.

2. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `tot` is updated based on the above expression.
   - `min_`, `min_idx`, `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are not used in the expression and their values are not altered by the given code snippet.

Since the only variable being updated is `tot`, and it is updated based on the given formula using the existing values of `min_`, `n`, `min_idx`, and `k`, the new value of `tot` can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{new\_tot} = \min_ + (\min_ - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1 - \min_idx) + k \]

Given that `i` is \( n-1 \) and `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \), these values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `outs` is `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations, `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is \( n-1 \), `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \), and `tot` is updated to `min_ + (\min_ - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1 - \min_idx) + k`.**
