The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement affecting the variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is updated by adding its initial value of `k` to itself, `min_idx` is 0, `k` is 0, `trg` is `a[1] - min_`.**
