The code `min_, min_idx = a[0], 0` assigns `a[0]` to `min_` and 0 to `min_idx`. The initial state of `outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. After executing the code, the values of `min_` and `min_idx` are updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.**
