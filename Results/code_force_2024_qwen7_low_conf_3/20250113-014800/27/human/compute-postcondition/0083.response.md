Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to \( n \), updating the `min_` and `min_idx` based on the condition involving `k` and `trg`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t > 1`
   - `outs = [tot]`
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers
   - `min_` is the smallest value in `a`
   - `min_idx` is 0
   - `n` and `k` are input integers

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \):
     - Calculate `trg = i * (a[i] - min_)`
     - If `k >= trg`:
       - Update `k` by subtracting `trg`
       - Set `min_` to `a[i]`
       - Set `min_idx` to `i`
     - Otherwise:
       - Update `min_` by adding `k // i`
       - Set `min_idx` to `i - 1`
       - Update `k` to `k % i`
       - Break the loop

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**

   - **Condition for Loop Execution:**
     - The loop will execute at least once if \( n > 1 \).
     - The loop will execute \( n-1 \) times in total if \( n > 1 \).

   - **Variables After the Loop:**
     - `t`: Remains unchanged unless explicitly modified outside the loop, so it is still \( t > 1 \).
     - `outs`: Remains `[tot]` unless modified outside the loop.
     - `a`: Remains a sorted list of integers.
     - `min_`: Final value of `min_` will be the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations.
     - `min_idx`: Final value of `min_idx` will be the index corresponding to the final `min_` value.
     - `n`: Remains unchanged as the loop only depends on its value.
     - `i`: The last value of `i` after the loop finishes, which is \( n-1 \).
     - `k`: Final value of `k` after the loop finishes, which could be any non-negative integer less than \( n \).

### Output State

Given the analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

**Output State:**
`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `outs` is `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations, `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is \( n-1 \), and `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \).
