Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `num_cards * n`, and `score` is updated as follows: if `num_cards` is greater than 0, `score` is incremented by `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `remaining_coins` is non-negative, and `remaining_cards` and `remaining_coins` are adjusted accordingly. If `num_cards` is 0, the conditions and adjustments remain unchanged from the precondition.***
