The code appends `remaining_coins` to the list `remaining_cards`. Initially, `remaining_cards` is a list of `cards` excluding `1`, and `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`.

Let's update the variables:

- `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is 1.
- `n` remains unchanged, so `n` must be greater than 0.
- `cards` remains unchanged.
- `coins` remains unchanged.
- `max_score` remains unchanged, so `max_score` is 0.
- `num_cards` remains unchanged, so `num_cards` is `cards[0]`.
- `remaining_coins` remains unchanged, so `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`.
- `score` remains unchanged, so `score` is `cards[0] * n`.
- `remaining_cards` is updated to include `remaining_coins`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `cards` is a list of n integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `max_score` is 0; `num_cards` is `cards[0]`; `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`; `score` is `cards[0] * n`; `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `cards` is a list of n integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `max_score` is 0; `num_cards` is `cards[0]`; `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`; `score` is `cards[0] * n`; `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`.**
