Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is updated, `min_idx` is either 0 or 1, `k` is reset to 0, `trg` is `a[1] - min_`. If `k >= trg`, then `min_` is `a[1]` and `min_idx` is 1, otherwise `min_` is updated by adding its initial value of `k` to itself and `min_idx` is 0.***
