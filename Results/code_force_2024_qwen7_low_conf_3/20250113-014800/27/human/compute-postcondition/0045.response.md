`outs` is an empty list before the code execution. The code appends `tot` to `outs`. Since `tot` is defined as `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`, and this value does not change during the execution of the code, `tot` remains as it was before appending. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`, `min_` is the smallest value in the list `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the last update, and `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`.**
