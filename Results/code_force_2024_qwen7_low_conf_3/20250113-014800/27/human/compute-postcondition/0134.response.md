Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `outs` is an empty list.

#### Loop Iteration:
The loop runs `t` times. For each iteration `tt` (from 0 to `t-1`):

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `n, k` are read from input.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input and sorted in ascending order.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `min_` is set to the first element of `a`.
   - `min_idx` is set to 0.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop iterates over the elements of `a` starting from the second element (index 1).
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `trg = i * (a[i] - min_)`.
   - If `k >= trg`, it updates `k`, `min_`, and `min_idx`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `min_` and `k`, and breaks the loop.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - If `min_idx` is `n - 1` and `k > 0`, it adjusts `min_` and `k`.
   - It calculates `tot` based on `min_`, `min_idx`, `n`, and `k`.

5. **Appending to `outs`**:
   - `tot` is appended to `outs`.

### Final Output State After All Iterations

After the outer loop completes all `t` iterations, the following conditions will hold:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `outs` is a list containing the result of the calculations for each iteration.
- For each iteration `tt`:
  - `n` and `k` are the values read from input.
  - `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers.
  - `min_` is the final minimum value calculated for the iteration.
  - `min_idx` is the index of the last update to `min_`.
  - `k` is the remaining value of `k` after the final adjustments.

### Detailed Output State

Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **``t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `outs` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k` for each iteration, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations for each `tt`, `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value for each `tt`, and `k` is the remaining value of `k` after the final adjustments for each `tt`.**
