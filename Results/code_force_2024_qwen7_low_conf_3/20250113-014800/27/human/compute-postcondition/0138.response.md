`out` is printed to the console. The value of `out` comes from the next element in the list `outs`. Since the list `outs` is non-empty, `out` is the first element of the list `outs`. After printing `out`, the value of `out` itself does not change, but it is no longer the next value in the list since the print function consumes the value from the list.

Output State: **`outs` is a non-empty list without its first element, `out` is the value that was printed**
