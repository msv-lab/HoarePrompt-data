`min_` is incremented by `k // n`. Since `min_` was initially the smallest value in the list `a` and `min_idx` is the index of the last update, which is `n - 1`, the smallest value in the list `a` hasn't changed yet (as no updates have occurred). The value of `min_` will be updated to the smallest value in the list `a` plus `k // n`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `k` is greater than 0, `min_` is the smallest value in the list `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the last update, and `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1**
