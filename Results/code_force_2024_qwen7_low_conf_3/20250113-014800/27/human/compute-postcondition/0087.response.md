Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `outs` is `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations, `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is \( n-1 \), and `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \). If `min_idx == n - 1` and `k > 0`, then `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // n` and `k` is updated to `k % n`. Otherwise, `min_` remains unchanged and `k` remains unchanged.***
