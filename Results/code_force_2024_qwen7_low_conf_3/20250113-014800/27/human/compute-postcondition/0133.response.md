`outs` is a list initialized with `[a[0], a[0]]`. The `append` method adds `tot` to the end of the list `outs`. The value of `tot` is given as `min_ * n - (n - 1) + k`. After appending, the new value of `outs` will be `[a[0], a[0], tot]`.

Output State: **`outs` is `[a[0], a[0], tot]`, `min_` is `min_`, `min_idx` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k % n`, and `tot` is `min_ * n - (n - 1) + k`.**
