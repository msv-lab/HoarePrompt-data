`min_idx` is reassigned the value of `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 4, `min_idx` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is either `a[2] + k // 4` or `(min_initial + k // 2) + k // 4`, `min_idx` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, `k` is either decreased by `2 * (a[2] - min_)` or reduced to `k % 2`, `trg` is `4 * (a[4] - min_)`**
