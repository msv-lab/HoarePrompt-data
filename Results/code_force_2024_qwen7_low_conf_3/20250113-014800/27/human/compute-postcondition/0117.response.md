Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`
   - `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`
   - `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // n` if `k >= trg`, otherwise `min_` remains `min_ + k // i`
   - `min_idx` is `n` if `k >= trg`, otherwise `min_idx` is `i - 1`
   - `k` is `k % i`

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the current value of `i` is the upper limit of the loop.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to 1 (the lower limit of the loop).

4. **Updating Other States:**
   - Since `i` is being reset to 1, we need to consider how the other variables might change.
   - `outs[0]` and `outs[1]` remain as they were because they are not affected by the loop itself.
   - `min_` and `min_idx` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is 1).
   - `k` will be reset to its initial value (since `k` is `k % i` and `i` is now 1, `k` will be `k % 1`, but typically `k` would be reset to its initial value before entering the loop).

5. **Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`
   - `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`
   - `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // 1` if `k >= trg`, otherwise `min_` remains `min_ + k`
   - `min_idx` is 0 if `k >= trg`, otherwise `min_idx` is `-1` (though typically, `min_idx` is adjusted based on the loop body logic)
   - `k` is reset to its initial value

Given the above analysis, the final states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is updated to `min_ + k` if `k >= trg`, otherwise `min_` remains `min_ + k`, `min_idx` is 0 if `k >= trg`, otherwise `min_idx` is `-1`, `k` is reset to its initial value**.
