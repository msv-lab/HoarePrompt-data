The value of `min_idx` is updated to `i - 1`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 2, `min_idx` becomes `2 - 1`, which is `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is `min_initial + k // 2`, `min_idx` is `1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `trg` is `2 * (a[2] - min_)`.

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is `min_initial + k // 2`, `min_idx` is `1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `trg` is `2 * (a[2] - min_)**.
