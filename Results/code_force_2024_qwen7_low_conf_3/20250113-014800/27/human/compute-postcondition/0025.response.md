`num_cards` is assigned the value of `cards[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `num_cards` becomes `cards[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `score`, `score` is `cards[1] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains `C - N + NC`, `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`**
