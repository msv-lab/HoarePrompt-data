Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `max_score` is calculated as follows:
  - If `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, then `max_score = cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
  - Otherwise, `max_score` remains 0
- `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
- `score` is calculated similarly to `max_score`
- `remaining_coins` is calculated as follows:
  - If `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, then `remaining_coins = coins - n + num_cards`
  - Otherwise, `remaining_coins` remains `coins - n + num_cards`
- `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`

### Loop Statement
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.

### Adjusted States
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- Since `i` was 1, we need to ensure that `i` is now 2.
- The values of `n`, `cards`, `coins`, `max_score`, `num_cards`, `score`, `remaining_coins`, and `remaining_cards` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but there is no indication of such modifications in the provided information.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains `coins - n + num_cards`, and `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`**

This ensures that the loop can continue its execution with `i` incremented to 2.
