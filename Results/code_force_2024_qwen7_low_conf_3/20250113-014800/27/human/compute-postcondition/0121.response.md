The code `min_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` to `min_idx`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `min_idx` will now be 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is `a[1]`, `min_idx` is 1, `k` is `k - (a[1] - min_)`, `trg` is `a[1] - min_`**
