The code sets `min_` to the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is `n`, `min_` will be assigned the value of `a[n]`.

- The value of `i` remains `n`.
- The value of `outs[0]` remains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`.
- The value of `outs[1]` remains either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, depending on the condition.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - (n * (a[n] - min_))`. Since `min_` is now `a[n]`, the term `(a[n] - min_)` becomes `0`, making `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`i` is `n`, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is `a[n]`, `k` is unchanged.**
