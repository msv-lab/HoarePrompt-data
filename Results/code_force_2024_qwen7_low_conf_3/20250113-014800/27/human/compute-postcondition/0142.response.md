The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it implies that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, and a list `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\).
- `a` is a list containing `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{12}\).

The output cases are not specified in the problem statement, so we will focus only on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and \(10^{12}\).**
