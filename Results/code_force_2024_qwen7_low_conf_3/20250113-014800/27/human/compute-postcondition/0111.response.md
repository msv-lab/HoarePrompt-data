The code assigns the value of `i` to `min_idx`. Since `i` is `n`, `min_idx` is assigned the value of `n`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `outs[0]` remains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`.
- `outs[1]` remains either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `min_` remains equal to `a[n]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`i` is `n`, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is `a[n]`, `k` is unchanged, `min_idx` is `n`.**
