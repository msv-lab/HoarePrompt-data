The code snippet `outs.append(tot)` appends the current value of `tot` to the list `outs`. From the initial state, we know that `outs` is initially `[tot]`. The value of `tot` is given by the expression `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`.

Let's substitute the known values into the expression for `tot`:
- `tot` is updated to `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`.
- `outs` is initially `[tot]`, so appending `tot` to `outs` changes it to `[tot, tot]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables after executing the code is:
- `outs` is now `[tot, tot]` (where `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`).
- `t` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations.
- `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is \( n-1 \).
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \).

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot, tot]` where `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations, `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is \( n-1 \), `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \)**.
