`min_` is incremented by `k // i`. The value of `i` is 1, so `k // i` is simply `k`. The value of `k` is reset to its initial value, which means `k` remains unchanged from its initial state. Therefore, `min_` is updated by adding the initial value of `k` to itself.

The other variables (`outs[0]`, `outs[1]`, `min_idx`, `k`, and `trg`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is updated by adding its initial value of `k` to itself, `min_idx` is 0 or `-1`, `k` is reset to its initial value, `trg` is `a[1] - min_`.**
