The code `min_ += k // n` updates the value of `min_` by adding `k // n` to its current value. Given the precondition, we know that `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, and `min_idx == n - 1`. This means that `min_` was previously the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations, and its index was `n - 1`.

Since `k` is greater than 0, `k // n` will be at least 0 (if `k` is less than `n`) and at most `k - 1` (if `k` is equal to `n`). However, the exact value of `k // n` depends on the specific value of `k`. Regardless, the value of `min_` will increase by `k // n`.

Therefore, the updated value of `min_` is its previous value plus `k // n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `outs` is `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is its previous value plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is \( n-1 \), and `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \)**
