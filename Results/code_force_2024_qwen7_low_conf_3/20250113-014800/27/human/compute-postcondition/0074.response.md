`trg` is assigned the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 4,
- `a` is a sorted list of integers,
- `min_` is either `a[2]` or `min_initial + k // 2`,
- `min_idx` is either 3 or 1.

We substitute the values:
- `trg = 4 * (a[4] - min_)`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is either `a[2]` or `min_initial + k // 2`, `min_idx` is either 3 or 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, `k` is either decreased by `2 * (a[2] - min_)` or reduced to `k % 2`, `trg` is `4 * (a[4] - min_)**, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
