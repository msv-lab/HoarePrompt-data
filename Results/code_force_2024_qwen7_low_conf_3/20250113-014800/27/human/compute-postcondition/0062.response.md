Postcondition: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0] + k`, `min_idx` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is 0 or `k` is greater than or equal to `trg`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `trg` is `second_min_a - min_a`.**
