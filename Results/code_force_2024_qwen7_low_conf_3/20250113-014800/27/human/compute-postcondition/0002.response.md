According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. The loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and will continue as long as `i` does not exceed `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of cards of each type.
- `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards.
- `max_score` is 0.

The key variables here are `i` and `n`. The loop will start with `i` being 1 and will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to 1 and ensure that `n` is at least 1. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, there are no other variables directly affected by the loop initialization that need adjustment.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards, `max_score` is 0**
