The code `remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]` creates a new list `remaining_cards` containing elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`. Given that `i` is 1 and `cards` is a list of `n` integers, we need to filter out the element `1` from `cards`.

The initial state provides us with:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `max_score` is 0
- `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`
- `score` is `cards[0] * n`

After executing the code, `remaining_cards` will be a list of all elements in `cards` except for `1`. 

Let's denote the initial `cards` as `[c1, c2, ..., cn]` where `c1` could be 1 or any other integer.

If `c1` (which is `cards[0]`) is 1, then `remaining_cards` will be `[c2, c3, ..., cn]`.

If `c1` is not 1, then `remaining_cards` will be `[c1, c2, ..., cn]`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `cards` except that `cards[0]` is `i` which is 1, the updated state will be:
- `remaining_cards` is a list of `cards` excluding `1`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of n integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`, `score` is `cards[0] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of `cards` excluding `1`**
