`min_idx` is assigned the value of `i - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `min_idx` becomes 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the smallest value in the list `a` plus `k`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `trg` is `second_min_a - min_a`, `k` is less than `second_min_a - min_a**
