The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the loop or block we are in. Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`; `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`; `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]` depending on the condition; `trg` is `n * (a[i] - min_)`; `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // i`; `min_idx` is `i - 1`; `k` is `k % i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
