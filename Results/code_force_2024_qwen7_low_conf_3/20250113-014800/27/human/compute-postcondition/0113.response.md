The code `min_idx = i - 1` assigns the value of `i - 1` to the variable `min_idx`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

- `i` is `n`.
- `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`.
- `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]` depending on the condition.
- `trg` is `n * (a[i] - min_)`.
- `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // i`.

After executing the code, the only change is that `min_idx` is now set to `i - 1`. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is `n`; `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`; `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]` depending on the condition; `trg` is `n * (a[i] - min_)`; `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // i`; `min_idx` is `i - 1`.**
