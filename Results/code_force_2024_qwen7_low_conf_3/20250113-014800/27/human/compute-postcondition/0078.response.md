The code `min_ += k // i` updates the value of `min_` by adding `k // i` to its current value. Given the initial conditions:

- `min_` is either `a[2]` or `min_initial + k // 2`
- `i` is 4

We need to calculate `k // i` and add it to `min_`. However, the exact value of `k` is not specified, so we'll keep it as `k`.

Therefore, the updated value of `min_` will be `min_ + k // 4`.

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is either `a[2] + k // 4` or `(min_initial + k // 2) + k // 4`, `min_idx` is either 3 or 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, `k` is either decreased by `2 * (a[2] - min_)` or reduced to `k % 2`, `trg` is `4 * (a[4] - min_)`**
