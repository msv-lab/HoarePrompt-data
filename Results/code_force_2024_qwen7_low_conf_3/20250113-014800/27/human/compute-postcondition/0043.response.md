Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`, `min_` is the smallest value in the list `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the last update. If `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is updated as the remainder of `k` divided by `n` and `min_` is updated to the smallest value in the list `a` plus `k // n`.***
