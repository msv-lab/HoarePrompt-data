`min_idx` is assigned the value `i - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `min_idx` becomes `1 - 1`, which is 0. The value of `i` does not change, and the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is updated by adding its initial value of `k` to itself, `min_idx` is 0, `k` is reset to its initial value, `trg` is `a[1] - min_`.**
