The code `min_ = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to the variable `min_`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 4. Therefore, `min_` will be updated to the value of `a[4]`.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `min_` is updated to `a[4]`.
- The value of `i` remains 4.

The other variables remain unchanged in their initial states. 

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is `a[4]`, `min_idx` is either 3 or 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, `k` is either decreased by `2 * (a[2] - min_)` or reduced to `k % 2`, `trg` is `4 * (a[4] - min_), `k` is `k - 4 * (a[4] - min_)**
