To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the changes that occur within the loop and how they affect the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `outs` is a list of two integers, where `outs[0]` is the minimum element in the list `a` up to the current index `i`, and `outs[1]` is the difference between the first two elements in `a`.
   - Depending on the value of `k` compared to `trg`, either:
     - `outs[0]` is set to `a[1]` and `outs[1]` is updated to `a[1] - a[0]`, or
     - `outs[0]` remains as `a[0]` and `outs[1]` is adjusted to `a[0] + k` if `k` becomes 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, so at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.

3. **Variables Involved:**
   - `i`: Will be incremented to `n` in the next iteration.
   - `outs`: Depending on the conditions inside the loop, `outs[0]` and `outs[1]` might change.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `n` (since it was `n-1` before).

5. **Adjusting `outs` Based on Conditions:**
   - We need to consider the possible values of `outs[0]` and `outs[1]` based on the given conditions:
     - If `k` is not zero, `outs[0]` will remain `a[0]` and `outs[1]` will be updated to `a[0] + k`.
     - If `k` becomes zero, `outs[0]` will be set to `a[1]` and `outs[1]` will be updated to `a[1] - a[0]`.

Given these points, let's summarize the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- `i` will be incremented to `n`.
- Depending on the conditions inside the loop, `outs[0]` and `outs[1]` will be adjusted accordingly.

Since the exact values of `a`, `k`, and `trg` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical values for `outs`. However, we know the general conditions under which `outs` might change.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is `n`, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, and `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]` depending on the condition.**

In summary, the specific values of `outs` will depend on the internal logic of the loop, but the key adjustments are:

- `i` is incremented to `n`.
- `outs` is adjusted based on the conditions specified.
