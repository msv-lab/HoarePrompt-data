The code `min_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` to `min_idx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `min_idx` will be updated to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is `a[1]`, `min_idx` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `trg` is `second_min_a - min_a`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0**
