The code updates the value of `score` to be `num_cards * n`. The previous definition of `score` was `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`. However, since the code simply reassigns `score` to `num_cards * n`, this new value overrides the previous one.

Given that `num_cards` is `cards[1]` and `n` is greater than 0, the updated `score` is `cards[1] * n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `score` is `cards[1] * n`, `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC`, and `remaining_cards` remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`.**
