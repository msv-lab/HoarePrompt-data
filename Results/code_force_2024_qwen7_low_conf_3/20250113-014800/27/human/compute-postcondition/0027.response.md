Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers
   - `coins` is a non-negative integer
   - `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `score`
   - `score` is `cards[1] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
   - `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`
   - `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`
   - `num_cards` is `cards[2]`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code sets `score = num_cards * n`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3 (unchanged)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers (unchanged)
- `coins` is a non-negative integer (unchanged)
- `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `score` (unchanged until the new `score` is computed)
- `num_cards` is `cards[2]` (unchanged until the new `score` is computed)

The only change is in the `score` variable. The new value of `score` is calculated as `num_cards * n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `num_cards * n`, `score` is `num_cards * n`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`**.
