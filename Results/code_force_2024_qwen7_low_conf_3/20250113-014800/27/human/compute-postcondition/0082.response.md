Postcondition: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is either `a[4]` or `a[2] + k // 4` or `(min_initial + k // 2) + k // 4`, `min_idx` is either 4 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, `k` is either `k - 4 * (a[4] - min_)` or `k % 4`, `trg` is `4 * (a[4] - min_)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
