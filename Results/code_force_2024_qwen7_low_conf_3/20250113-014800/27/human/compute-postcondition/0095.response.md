Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`
- `t` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
- `min_` is `a[0]`
- `min_idx` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer

### For Loop
The for loop is defined as follows:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Range of the For Loop**: The for loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.
2. **Variable `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 1 (the starting point of the loop).

### States to Adjust
- Ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to allow the loop to start.
- Set `i` to 1 to match the starting value of the loop.

### Modified States
- `total` (not mentioned in the initial states but part of the format) remains unchanged since it is not involved in this specific loop.
- `outs` remains `[a[0], a[0]]`.
- `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `min_` remains `a[0]`.
- `min_idx` remains 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute.
- `i` must be 1 to match the starting value of the loop.

### Final Answer
State: **`outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
