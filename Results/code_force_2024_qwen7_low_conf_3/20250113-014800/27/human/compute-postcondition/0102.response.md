The value of `min_` is incremented by `k // i`. The initial value of `min_` is `a[0]`, and since `i` is 1, `k // i` is simply `k`. Therefore, the new value of `min_` is `a[0] + k`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `k` is less than `a[1] - a[0]`**
