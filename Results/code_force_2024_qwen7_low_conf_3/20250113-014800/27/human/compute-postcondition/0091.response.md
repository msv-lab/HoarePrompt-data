`n` and `k` are assigned the values of the integers input from the user using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of the other variables (`outs`, `t`, `a`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot, tot]`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop iterations, `min_idx` is the index corresponding to the final `min_` value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is \( n-1 \), `k` is a non-negative integer less than \( n \), `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.**
