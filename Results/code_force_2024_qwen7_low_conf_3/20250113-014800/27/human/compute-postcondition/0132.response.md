Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`
   - `min_` is `min_ + k // n` if `min_idx` is `n - 1` and `k > 0`, otherwise the values of `outs`, `min_`, `min_idx`, and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `min_idx` is `n - 1`
   - `k` is `k % n`

2. **Code Snippet**: 
   ```python
   tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The code calculates the value of `tot` using the formula provided. We need to determine the exact value of `tot` based on the initial conditions.

4. **Substitute Initial Values**:
   - Since `min_` is `min_ + k // n` if `min_idx` is `n - 1` and `k > 0`, and given that `min_idx` is `n - 1` and `k` is `k % n`, `min_` will be updated to `min_ + k // n`.
   - Given that `k` is `k % n`, and assuming `k` is less than `n` (since `k` is the remainder when divided by `n`), the value of `min_` will be `min_ + k // n`, which simplifies to `min_ + 0` because `k` is less than `n`.

5. **Calculate `tot`**:
   - Substitute the values into the formula:
     \[
     tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1 - (n - 1)) + k
     \]
     Simplify the expression:
     \[
     tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) \times (n - 1) + 0 + k
     \]
     Further simplify:
     \[
     tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) \times (n - 1) + k
     \]
     \[
     tot = min_ + min_ \times (n - 1) - (n - 1) + k
     \]
     \[
     tot = min_ \times n - (n - 1) + k
     \]

6. **Final Output State**:
   - `outs` remains `[a[0], a[0]]` because no changes were made to this list.
   - `min_` is `min_ + k // n`, which simplifies to `min_ + 0` or simply `min_`.
   - `min_idx` remains `n - 1`.
   - `k` remains `k % n`.
   - `tot` is calculated as `min_ \times n - (n - 1) + k`.

Output State: **`outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `min_` is `min_`, `min_idx` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k % n`, and `tot` is `min_ \times n - (n - 1) + k`.**
