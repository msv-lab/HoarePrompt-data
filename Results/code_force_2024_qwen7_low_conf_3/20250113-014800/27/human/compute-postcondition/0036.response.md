The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cards`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, and `coins`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards. The length of `cards` is `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each integer in `cards` is between 1 and 10^12, inclusive. The function returns `max_score`, which is the maximum score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `cards` of `n` integers and a non-negative integer `coins`. It returns `max_score`, the maximum score obtained under the given conditions.**
