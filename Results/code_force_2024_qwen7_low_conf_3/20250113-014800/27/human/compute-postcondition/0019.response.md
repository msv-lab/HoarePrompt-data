The code appends `remaining_coins` to `remaining_cards`. The value of `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC`. The `append` method adds this value to the end of the `remaining_cards` list. 

Therefore, the updated value of `remaining_cards` will include the original elements plus the new element `remaining_coins`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `score` is `cards[1] * n`, `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC`, `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]`**
