The code `print(out)` simply prints the value of the variable `out`. It does not assign any new value to `out` or modify any other variables. The initial state of `outs` being a non-empty list is not directly affected by this code snippet. The output of the program will be the value of `out`, but the variable `outs` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is a non-empty list, `out` is printed value**
