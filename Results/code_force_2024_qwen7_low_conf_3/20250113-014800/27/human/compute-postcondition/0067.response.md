The line `min_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` to `min_idx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `min_idx` will be set to 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is `a[2]`, `min_idx` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - min_)`.**
