Let's analyze the given code step by step:

- Initial State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `num_cards * n`, `score` is `num_cards * n`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`.

- Code: `remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]`

This code creates a new list `remaining_cards` that contains only the elements from the original `cards` list where each element is not equal to `i`. Since `i` is 3, `remaining_cards` will contain all elements from `cards` except those that are equal to 3.

Given that `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, and without knowing the exact values of the `cards` list, we can infer that `remaining_cards` will be the original `cards` list excluding the element at index 2 (which is `num_cards`) and also excluding all occurrences of 3.

Since the exact values of the `cards` list are not specified, let's denote the original `cards` list as `[a, b, 3, d, e, ...]` (assuming there are at least 3 elements).

After applying the condition, `remaining_cards` will be `[a, b, d, e, ...]` if `3` is the third element (`cards[2]`), otherwise it will exclude the third element and all 3s from the list.

The other variables remain unchanged: `i` is still 3, `n` is greater than 0, `coins`, `max_score`, `score`, `remaining_coins`, and `num_cards` are unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `num_cards * n`, `score` is `num_cards * n`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `remaining_cards` is `[a, b, d, e, ...]` if `3` is the third element, or the original list excluding the third element and all 3s, `num_cards` is the second element of `cards`.**
