Postcondition: **`outs` is a list of two integers, where `outs[0]` is the minimum element in the list `a` up to the current index `i`, and `outs[1]` is the difference between the first two elements in `a`. Depending on the value of `k` compared to `trg`, either `outs[0]` is set to `a[1]` and `outs[1]` is updated to `a[1] - a[0]`, or `outs[0]` remains as `a[0]` and `outs[1]` is adjusted to `a[0] + k` if `k` becomes 0.**
