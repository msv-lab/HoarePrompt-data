`min_idx` is assigned the value `i - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `min_idx` becomes `1 - 1`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `k` is less than `a[1] - a[0]`**
