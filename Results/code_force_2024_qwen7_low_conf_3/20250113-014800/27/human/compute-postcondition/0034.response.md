Let's analyze the given loop and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `cards` is a list of \( n \) integers representing the initial number of cards of each type.
- `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards.
- `max_score` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    num_cards = cards[i - 1]
    if num_cards > 0:
        remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
        if remaining_coins >= 0:
            score = num_cards * n
            remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]
            remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)
            score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)
            max_score = max(max_score, score)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over each index \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each iteration, it checks if the number of cards of the current type (`num_cards`) is greater than 0.
   - If `num_cards` is greater than 0, it calculates the remaining coins after buying \( n - num_cards \) more cards.
   - If the remaining coins are non-negative, it calculates the score based on the current number of cards and the function `func_1`.
   - It updates `max_score` with the maximum of the current `max_score` and the calculated `score`.

2. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - After all iterations, the loop will have considered each type of card (from 1 to \( n \)) where the number of cards is greater than 0.
   - The `max_score` will be the highest score achieved across all iterations where the conditions were met.

### Final Output State:

- `i` will be \( n \) because the loop will iterate up to \( n \) if all conditions are met.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `cards` will remain the same as the initial list since no modifications are made to the original list inside the loop.
- `coins` will remain the same as the initial value since no modifications are made to the original value inside the loop.
- `max_score` will be the highest score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State:**
- `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum score obtained from all valid iterations where the conditions were met.
