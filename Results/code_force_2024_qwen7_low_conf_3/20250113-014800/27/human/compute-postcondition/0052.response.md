`trg` is assigned the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the smallest value in the list `a`, and `a[i]` would be the second smallest element in the list since `a` is sorted and `min_` is the smallest. 

Since `a` is a sorted list and `min_` is the smallest value, `a[i]` is the next smallest value in the list. Let's denote the smallest value in `a` as `min_a` and the second smallest value as `second_min_a`. Therefore, `trg` is calculated as `1 * (second_min_a - min_a)`, which simplifies to `second_min_a - min_a`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the smallest value in the list `a`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `trg` is `second_min_a - min_a`.

Output State: **`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is the smallest value in the list `a`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `trg` is `second_min_a - min_a`**.
