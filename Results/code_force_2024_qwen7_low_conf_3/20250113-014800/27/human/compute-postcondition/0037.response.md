Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `cards` containing `n` integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, and a non-negative integer `coins` representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards. The function recursively calculates the maximum score possible by considering each type of card individually. For each type of card, it checks if buying more cards of that type is feasible with the current coins. If so, it calculates a score and recursively calls itself with the updated state (reduced coins and modified card count). The function keeps track of the maximum score achieved and returns this value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 0, the function will immediately return 0 because the loop will not execute.
- If all card counts in `cards` are 0, the function will also return 0 as no score can be achieved.
- If `coins` is less than the cost to buy any additional card (i.e., `n - num_cards`), the function will skip the recursive call for that card type.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that the function should update `cards` and `coins` within the loop, but the actual code does not modify these variables. This means the function maintains the original `cards` and `coins` throughout its execution, only calculating scores based on the original inputs.
