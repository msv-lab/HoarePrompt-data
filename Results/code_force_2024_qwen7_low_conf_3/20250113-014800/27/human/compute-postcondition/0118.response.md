First, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
trg = i * (a[i] - min_)
```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`
- `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`
- `min_` is updated to `min_ + k` if `k >= trg`, otherwise `min_` remains `min_ + k`
- `min_idx` is 0 if `k >= trg`, otherwise `min_idx` is `-1`
- `k` is reset to its initial value

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Calculate `trg`**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`.
   - We need the value of `min_`. The exact value of `min_` is not specified in the initial state, so let's denote it as `min_`.

2. **Update `trg`**:
   - `trg` is calculated as `1 * (a[1] - min_)`, which simplifies to `a[1] - min_`.

### Impact on Variables

- `trg` is now set to `a[1] - min_`.
- None of the other variables (`outs[0]`, `outs[1]`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `k`) are directly affected by this line of code.

### Output State

- `i` remains 1.
- `outs[0]` remains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`.
- `outs[1]` remains either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`.
- `min_` remains unchanged unless `k >= trg` and `min_` would be updated to `min_ + k`, but since `k` is reset to its initial value, this condition does not apply here.
- `min_idx` remains 0 or `-1` unless `k >= trg` and the conditions would be re-evaluated, but again, `k` being reset means no changes.
- `k` is reset to its initial value.

Thus, the only variable that has a new value is `trg`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `outs[0]` is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `outs[1]` is either `a[0] + k` or `a[1] - a[0]`, `min_` is unchanged, `min_idx` is 0 or `-1`, `k` is reset to its initial value, `trg` is `a[1] - min_`.**
