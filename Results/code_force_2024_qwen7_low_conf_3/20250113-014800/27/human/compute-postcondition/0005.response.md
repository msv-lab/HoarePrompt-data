The code subtracts `(n - num_cards)` from `coins` to assign the result to `remaining_coins`. Here, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is the initial value of `cards[0]` and is greater than 0. The value of `coins` is a non-negative integer.

After the operation, the value of `remaining_coins` is calculated as `coins - (n - num_cards)`, which simplifies to `coins - n + num_cards`.

The other variables (`i`, `cards`, `coins`, `max_score`, and `num_cards`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards, `max_score` is 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, and `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`.**
