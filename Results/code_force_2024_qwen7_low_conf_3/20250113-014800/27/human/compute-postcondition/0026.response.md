Let's go through the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers
   - `coins` is a non-negative integer
   - `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `score`
   - `score` is `cards[1] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
   - `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains `C - N + NC`
   - `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`
   - `num_cards` is `cards[2]`

2. The code snippet:
   ```python
   remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
   ```

3. Analyzing the code:
   - `remaining_coins` is updated to `coins - (n - num_cards)`.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, `cards`, `coins`, `max_score`, `score`, and `func_1` remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, we can determine the updated state:

- `i` remains 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `cards` remains a list of `n` integers.
- `coins` remains a non-negative integer.
- `max_score` remains the maximum of `max_score` and `score`.
- `score` remains `cards[1] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
- `remaining_coins` is now `coins - (n - num_cards)`.
- `remaining_cards` remains `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`.
- `num_cards` remains `cards[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is the maximum of `max_score` and `score`, `score` is `cards[1] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]` if `C - N + NC >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`.**
