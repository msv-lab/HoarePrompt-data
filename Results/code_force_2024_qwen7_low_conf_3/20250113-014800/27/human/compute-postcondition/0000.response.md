The code `n = len(cards)` calculates the length of the list `cards` and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the value of `cards` or `coins`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cards` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, and coins is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards; `n` is the length of the list `cards`.**
