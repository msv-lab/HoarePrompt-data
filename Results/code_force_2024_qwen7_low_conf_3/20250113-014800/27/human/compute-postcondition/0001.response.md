The line of code `max_score = 0` initializes the variable `max_score` to 0. This assignment does not affect the list `cards` or the variable `coins`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `max_score` with the value 0.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, and `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards; `max_score` is 0.**
