`trg` is assigned the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Given that `i` is 1, `min_` is `a[0]`, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the value of `trg` is calculated as `1 * (a[1] - a[0])`, which simplifies to `a[1] - a[0]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`**
