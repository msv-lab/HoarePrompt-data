The code `score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` impacts the `score` variable by adding the return value of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to the current value of `score`. The `remaining_cards` and `remaining_coins` variables are passed as arguments to the function `func_1`, but their values remain unchanged in the current scope. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `max_score` is 0
- `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`
- `score` is `cards[0] * n`
- `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`

After executing the code, `score` is updated to `score + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `max_score` is 0; `num_cards` is `cards[0]`; `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`; `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`; `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`.**
