`num_cards` is assigned the value of `cards[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `num_cards` is assigned the value of `cards[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `cards` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of cards of each type; `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards; `max_score` is 0; `num_cards` is `cards[0]`.
