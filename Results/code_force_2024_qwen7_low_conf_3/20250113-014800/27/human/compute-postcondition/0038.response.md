Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `i + 1`. If `k >= trg`, then `min_` is `a[i]`, `trg` is 0, and `min_idx` is `i + 1`. Otherwise, `min_` is incremented by `k // i`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, and `k` is `k % i`. The loop or if statement is exited.***
