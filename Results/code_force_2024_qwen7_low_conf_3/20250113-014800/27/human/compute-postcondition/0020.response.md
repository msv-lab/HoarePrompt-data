The code snippet updates the `score` by adding the result of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to it. The value of `remaining_cards` and `remaining_coins` remains unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, we need to update the value of `score` accordingly.

From the initial state:
- `score` is equal to `cards[1] * n`
- `remaining_coins` is equal to `C - N + NC`
- `remaining_cards` is equal to `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]`

After the code executes:
- `score` becomes `score + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`

Since `remaining_cards` and `remaining_coins` are unchanged, the expression for `max_score` also remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `coins - n + num_cards >= 0`, or remains 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `score` is `cards[1] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_coins` is `C - N + NC`, `remaining_cards` is `[cards[2:], remaining_coins]`**
