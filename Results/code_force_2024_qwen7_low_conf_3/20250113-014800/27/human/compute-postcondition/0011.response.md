The code updates `max_score` to be the maximum of its current value and `score`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `max_score` is 0
- `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`
- `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`

The impact of the code `max_score = max(max_score, score)` is to set `max_score` to the higher value between its current value (0) and the new value of `score`.

Since `score` is defined as `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, and `max_score` was initially 0, `max_score` will now be updated to this value of `score` if `score` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `max_score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`
- `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins), `num_cards` is `cards[0], `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards, `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins), `remaining_cards` is the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins.`**
