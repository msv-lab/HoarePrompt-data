The code assigns `num_cards * n` to `score`. Here, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `score` is updated to the value of `cards[0] * n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards, `max_score` is 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - n + num_cards`, and `score` is `cards[0] * n`.**
