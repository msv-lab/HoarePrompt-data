Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `max_score` is either `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `remaining_coins >= 0`, or remains 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is either `coins - n + num_cards` if `remaining_coins >= 0`, or remains `coins - n + num_cards`, `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `remaining_coins >= 0`, or remains `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, and `remaining_cards` is either the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins` if `remaining_coins >= 0`, or remains the original list of `cards` excluding `1` plus `remaining_coins`***
