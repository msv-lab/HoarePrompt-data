Postcondition: ***`total` is greater than 0, `outs` is now `[tot]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_` is either `a[2]` or `min_initial + k // 2`, `min_idx` is either 3 or 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is either 3 or 2, `k` is either decreased by `2 * (a[2] - min_)` or reduced to `k % 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
