The function `func_1` accepts a list `cards` containing `n` integers representing the initial number of cards of each type, and a non-negative integer `coins` representing the number of coins available for buying additional cards. The function recursively calculates the maximum score possible by considering each type of card individually. For each type of card, it checks if buying more cards of that type is feasible with the current coins. If so, it calculates a score and recursively calls itself with the updated state (reduced coins and modified card count). The function keeps track of the maximum score achieved and returns this value.
