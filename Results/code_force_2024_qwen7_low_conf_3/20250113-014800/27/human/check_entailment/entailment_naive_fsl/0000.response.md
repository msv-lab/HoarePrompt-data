Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The core issue lies in the recursive approach used to calculate the maximum score. The function `func_1` attempts to incrementally build the best possible arrangement by buying more cards and recalculating the score recursively. However, this approach is overly simplistic and does not account for the complexity of arranging the cards optimally.

A key requirement is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The current implementation does not consider the detailed steps needed to achieve this goal. Instead, it tries to buy more cards and hope for the best, which is not sufficient for finding the optimal solution.

For instance, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
5 3
2 2 2 2 2

Output (Expected):
20

Output (Given Program):
0
```

In this case, the given program returns `0`, which is incorrect. The optimal solution involves buying 3 cards of any type and arranging them such that there are 20 valid subarrays of length 5. The program fails to explore the necessary permutations and combinations required to achieve this.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, making its correctness `False`.
