Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the maximum score by considering different ways to rearrange and possibly augment the initial set of cards. The function `func_1` recursively explores different scenarios by checking if buying more cards of a specific type is feasible with the remaining coins and then calculating the potential score. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Base Case Missing**: The function does not handle the base case where `coins` is zero or there are no cards left to consider. This could lead to infinite recursion in some scenarios.
2. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The score calculation is based on the assumption that buying more cards will always result in a valid permutation of the required length `n`. This is not necessarily true, as buying additional cards might not fill the gaps correctly.
3. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls do not correctly reflect the problem constraints, especially when considering the permutation requirement.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not accurately solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
