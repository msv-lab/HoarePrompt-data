Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the core issue lies in how the function attempts to maximize the score by recursively calling itself. Hereâ€™s why the program does not meet the requirements:

1. **Incorrect Recursive Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to recursively calculate the maximum score by considering each card type one by one. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't consider the optimal way to distribute the purchased cards to achieve the maximum score.
   - The function calculates the score by assuming that the number of cards of a particular type is increased, but it does not ensure that the resulting arrangement forms contiguous subarrays that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Overcomplicated Logic**:
   - The logic within the loop is overly complex and does not correctly simulate the process of rearranging cards to form the desired subarrays. The function `func_1` attempts to modify the `cards` list and `coins` variable in recursive calls, but it fails to properly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem.

3. **Missing Key Steps**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the score by strategically purchasing cards to form contiguous subarrays that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The function `func_1` does not have the necessary steps to identify and create such subarrays effectively.
   - The recursive approach should ideally involve trying different distributions of purchased cards and evaluating the resulting subarrays, but the current implementation does not capture these key steps.

To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to:
- Identify the minimum number of each card type needed to form the desired subarrays.
- Calculate the maximum score by distributing the purchased cards optimally.
- Ensure that the final arrangement of cards forms the maximum number of contiguous subarrays that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Given these issues, the provided program does not accurately solve the problem as described, hence the correctness is **False**.
