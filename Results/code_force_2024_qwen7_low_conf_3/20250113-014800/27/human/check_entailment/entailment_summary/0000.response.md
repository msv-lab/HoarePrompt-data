Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a recursive approach.
2. The function `func_1` aims to maximize the score by recursively trying to improve the card distribution.
3. However, the logic within the function is flawed:
   - The function tries to buy more cards of a specific type and then calls itself recursively. This approach might not correctly reflect the strategy to maximize the score.
   - The function does not account for the fact that the goal is to form contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Instead, it focuses on individual card types and their counts.
   - The function does not ensure that the final arrangement of cards forms such contiguous subarrays.
4. The core issue is that the function does not properly simulate the process of rearranging the cards to achieve the desired permutations and thus cannot correctly compute the maximum score.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem and does not follow the necessary logic to achieve the maximum score as required.
