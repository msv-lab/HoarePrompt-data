Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs based on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 0.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
   - `index` is `index + 2`.
   - `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - After each iteration, `k` is decremented by 1 because it is within the range of `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be `k - 1`.
   - All other variables (`r`, `c`, `index`, `additional_areas`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and these variables are not modified within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be `k - 1`, and it should still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
- `k` is greater than 0 (which means it will be `k - 1`).
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `index` is `index + 2`.
- `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

State: **`k` is greater than 0 (so k - 1 is greater than 0), `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**.
