Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, `index` is `(original index + 2 * k + 2 * k) + 3 = original index + 4 * k + 3`, `k` is 0 (since the loop executes `k` times and `k` is initialized outside the loop), `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
