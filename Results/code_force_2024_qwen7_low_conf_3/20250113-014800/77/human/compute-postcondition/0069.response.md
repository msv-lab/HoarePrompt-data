The value of `index` is incremented by 2, changing its value from `index + 2` to `index + 4`. The values of `k`, `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, and `n`, `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[(index + 2)]`; `index` is `index + 4`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[(index + 2)]`; `index` is `index + 4`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
