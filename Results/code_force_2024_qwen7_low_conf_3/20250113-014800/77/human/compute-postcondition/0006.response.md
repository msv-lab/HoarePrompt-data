Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `r` and `c` are integers such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\) and \(1 \leq c \leq m\).
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string based on whitespace.
- `index` is 2.
- `results` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations, where `t` is determined by the integer value of `data[0]`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is already set as the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `c`, `data`, `index`, and `results` are as provided.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (since the range function expects a non-negative integer).
   - There is no explicit condition within the loop that requires any other state adjustment based on the given code snippet.

4. **Ensuring Loop Execution**:
   - We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer because the range function in Python would raise an error if `t` were negative or zero.
   - Since `t` is derived from `data[0]`, and assuming `data[0]` is a valid integer, we don't need to adjust any other states.

### Final State Adjustment:

Since `t` is derived from `data[0]` and should be a positive integer for the loop to execute, we only need to ensure that `t` is positive. The other states (`n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `c`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) are already correctly set according to the problem statement.

### State Adjustment:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\), `c` is an integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq m\), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected.
