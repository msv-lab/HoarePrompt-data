The code initializes an empty list `additional_areas`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1 or more, `index` is the previous index + 5, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `m` is the integer value of `c`, `k` is `data[index + 2]`, `alpha` is `(data[index] * data[index + 1] + 1) // 2`, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `additional_areas` is an empty list**
