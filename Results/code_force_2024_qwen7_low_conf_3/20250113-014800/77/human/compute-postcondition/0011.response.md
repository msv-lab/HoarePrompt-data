`alpha` is assigned the value of `(n * m + 1) // 2`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are taken from the list `data`, specifically `data[2]`, `data[3]`, and `data[4]` respectively. The values of `r`, `c`, `data`, `index`, and `results` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `alpha` is calculated based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\), `c` is an integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq m\), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
