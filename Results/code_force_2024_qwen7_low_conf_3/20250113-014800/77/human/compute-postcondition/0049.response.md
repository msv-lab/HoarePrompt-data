The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. The previous value of `c` was the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k) + 8]`. After executing this line, the value of `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now a list containing the previous results and the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is `(original index + 2 * k) + 7`, `k` is now `k - 1` (must be at least 0), `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k) + 7]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k) + 8]`, `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
