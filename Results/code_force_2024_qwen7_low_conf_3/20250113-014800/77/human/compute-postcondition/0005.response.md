The code initializes an empty list called `results`. No changes are made to the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `c`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ c ≤ m, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string based on whitespace, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**.
