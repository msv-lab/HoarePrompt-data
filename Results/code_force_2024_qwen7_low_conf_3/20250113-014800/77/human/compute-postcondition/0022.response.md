`additional_areas` appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to itself. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 2`. The variables `r`, `c`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is the integer value of `data[index-2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index-2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 0**
