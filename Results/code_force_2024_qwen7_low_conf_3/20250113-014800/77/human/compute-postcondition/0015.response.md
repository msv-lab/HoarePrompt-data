The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. The variable `r` retains its value as the integer value of `data[index]`, and the variables `data` and `index` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` retains its previous values, `index` retains its previous value**
