The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The previous value of `index` was `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 5`. After incrementing, the new value of `index` will be `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 7`.

All other variables remain unchanged in value.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` from previous iterations and the new result, `index` is `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 7`, `k` must be at least 1, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
