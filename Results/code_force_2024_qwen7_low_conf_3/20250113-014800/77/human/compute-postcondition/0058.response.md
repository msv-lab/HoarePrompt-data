The code `index += 3` increments the value of `index` by 3. Initially, `index` was set to the previous index + 2. After the increment, `index` will be the previous index + 5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

- `t` is 1 or more.
- `index` is the previous index + 5.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `m` is the integer value of `c`.
- `k` is `data[index + 2]`.
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` where `alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is 1 or more, `index` is the previous index + 5, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `m` is the integer value of `c`, `k` is `data[index + 2]`, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` where `alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2`**
