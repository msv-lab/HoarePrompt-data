The value of `index` is increased by 2. This means that the value of `index` is now its original value plus 2. The values of `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index-2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 0**
