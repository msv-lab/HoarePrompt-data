In the given code, `alpha` and `additional_areas` are assigned the first tuple from the list `results`. The list `results` is not empty as per the initial state. Therefore, `alpha` will take the first element of the first tuple, and `additional_areas` will take the second element of the first tuple.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple, `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`**
