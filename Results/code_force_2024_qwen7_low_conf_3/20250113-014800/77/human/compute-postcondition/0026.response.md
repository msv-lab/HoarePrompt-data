The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The other variables (`r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 1**
