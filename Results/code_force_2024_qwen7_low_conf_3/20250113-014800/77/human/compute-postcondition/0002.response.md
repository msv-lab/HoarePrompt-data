The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. The value of `index` is simply set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ c ≤ m, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string based on whitespace, and `index` is 0.**
