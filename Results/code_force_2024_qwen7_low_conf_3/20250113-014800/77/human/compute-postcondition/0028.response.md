Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2 * `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop.**
