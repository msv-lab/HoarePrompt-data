The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `m`, converting it to an integer using `int`. This changes the value of `m` but does not affect the values of `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, `index`, `k`, `results`, and `n`. The value of `index` is also updated to `index + 2 * k` as part of the precondition.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times, `index` is now `original index + 2 * k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `t + 1`, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
