Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of iterations the loop should perform.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
   - `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration.
   - `index` is the original index plus 3.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
   - `alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `t` times. Each iteration updates the values of `r`, `c`, `n`, and `m` based on the current `index` and appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to `additional_areas`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `t` is the control variable for the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is reduced by 1 (assuming it was initialized as `t+1` before the loop).
   - Therefore, `t` must be 1 or more for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Updating Other Variables**:
   - `index` increases by 2 after each iteration because `r` and `c` are read from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively.
   - After each iteration, `n` and `m` are updated to the new values of `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively.
   - `k` remains 0.
   - `results` and `additional_areas` are updated with the new values but do not affect the loop condition directly.

Given this analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

- `t` must be 1 or more.
- `index` increases by 2 from its previous value.
- `r` and `c` are updated to the new values of `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the new values of `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively.
- `k` remains 0.
- `results` and `additional_areas` are updated but their exact contents are not specified in the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be 1 or more, `index` is the previous index + 2, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `k` is 0, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` where `alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2`**.
