The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was `index + 8`, so the new value of `index` is `(index + 8) + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `(index + 8) + 2`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.**
