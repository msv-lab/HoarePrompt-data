The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. This means that `additional_areas` now contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` in addition to its previous contents.

The other variables (`k`, `r`, `c`, `index`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `(index + 8) + 2`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.
