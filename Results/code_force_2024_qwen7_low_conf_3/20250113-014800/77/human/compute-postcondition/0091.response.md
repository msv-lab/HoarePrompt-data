Output State: **`results` is a list containing tuples, where each tuple contains an `alpha` and a list `additional_areas` representing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration; `alpha` is the value calculated as `(n \times m + 1) // 2` for the original values of `n` and `m` from the initial state; `additional_areas` is a list of results obtained from calling `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration; the console prints the string representation of `additional_areas` elements joined by a space for each iteration.**
