The code updates the value of `r` to the integer value of `data[index]`. The previous value of `r` was `data[index-2]`. Since `data[index]` is being converted to an integer, `r` now holds this new integer value. The other variables (`c`, `additional_areas`, `index`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 1**
