The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `r`. Since `data[index]` is an integer (as mentioned in the initial state), `r` will take the integer value of `data[index]`.

- The initial state indicates that `k > 0`, so `k - 1 > 0` remains true.
- `r` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `c` remains the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `index` is updated to `index + 2`.
- `additional_areas` remains unchanged and contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
