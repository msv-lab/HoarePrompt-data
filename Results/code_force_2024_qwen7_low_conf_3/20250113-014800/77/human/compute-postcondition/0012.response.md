The code initializes an empty list named `additional_areas`. No changes are made to any of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\), `c` is an integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq m\), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\); `additional_areas` is an empty list.**
