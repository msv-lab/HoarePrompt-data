The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `c`. Since `data[index + 1]` is not specified in the initial state, `c` will be assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is increased by 2, `k` must be greater than 0**
