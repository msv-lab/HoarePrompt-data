Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (k-1)*2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[(index - (k-1)*2) + 1]`, `index` is `index + (k*2) - 2`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended `k` times.**

Explanation:
- The loop increments `index` by 2 in each iteration and appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to `additional_areas`.
- After executing `k` times, `index` will be `index + (k*2) - 2`.
- The value of `r` will be the integer value of `data[index - (k-1)*2]` because `index` starts from the original `index` and moves forward by 2 in each iteration.
- Similarly, the value of `c` will be the integer value of `data[(index - (k-1)*2) + 1]`.
- `additional_areas` will contain the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended `k` times, assuming the loop executes at least once.

If the loop does not execute (`k` is 0):
- `index` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- `additional_areas` remains an empty list.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is as stated above.
