Let's break down the problem step by step to understand how the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- The code snippet `additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))` appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the `additional_areas` list.
- `r`, `c`, `n`, and `m` remain the same as they were before the code execution.
- The `index` is updated to `(original index + 2 * k) + 5`.
- The `additional_areas` list is modified by appending the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `additional_areas` is now a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`
- `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 5`
- `k` must be at least 0
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for __ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `k` iterations. Each iteration appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the `additional_areas` list.
2. **Updating Variables**:
   - `r`, `c`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
   - `index` is updated to `(original index + 2 * k) + 5`.
   - `k` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.
   - `alpha` remains the same since it is calculated based on `n` and `m`.

### State Adjustment for Next Iteration:
- `r` and `c` remain the same.
- `n` and `m` remain the same.
- `k` must be incremented by 1 to ensure the loop can run for one more iteration.
- `index` is updated to `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 5`.
- `results` remains the same as it is updated only when the loop completes.

### Updated States:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `additional_areas` is a list containing the results from previous iterations and the new result.
- `index` is now `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 5`
- `k` must be at least 1 (since we are considering the next iteration)
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)

### Final Answer:
State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` from previous iterations and the new result, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 5`, `k` must be at least 1, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**.
