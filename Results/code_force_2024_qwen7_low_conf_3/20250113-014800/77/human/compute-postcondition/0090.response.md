The code prints the elements of `additional_areas` as a space-separated string. This does not change the values of `results`, `alpha`, or `additional_areas`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the side effect of printing the `additional_areas`.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple; `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`; `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`; printed output is the elements of `additional_areas` as a space-separated string.**
