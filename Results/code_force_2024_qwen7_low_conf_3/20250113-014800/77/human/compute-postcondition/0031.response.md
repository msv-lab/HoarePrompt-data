`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is an integer, so `n` becomes that integer. The other variables (`r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, `index`, `k`, `results`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2 * `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `t + 1`, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**.
