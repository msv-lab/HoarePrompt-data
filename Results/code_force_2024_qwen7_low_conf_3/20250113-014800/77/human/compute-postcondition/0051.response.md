The code `additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))` appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the `additional_areas` list. 

From the initial state:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `additional_areas` is a list containing the previous results and the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`
- `index` is `(original index + 2 * k + 9)`
- `k` is now `k - 1` (must be at least 0)
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k + 9)]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k + 10)]`
- `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)

After the code runs, the `additional_areas` list will have its last element updated to the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is a list containing the previous results and the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is `(original index + 2 * k + 9)`, `k` is now `k - 1` (must be at least 0), `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k + 9)]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k + 10)]`, `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
