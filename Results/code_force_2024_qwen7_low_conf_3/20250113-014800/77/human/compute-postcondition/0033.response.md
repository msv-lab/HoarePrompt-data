The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to the variable `k`. Given that `data[index + 2]` is an integer, `k` will also be an integer with the value of `data[index + 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times, `index` is now `original index + 2 * k`, `k` is `data[index + 2]`, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
