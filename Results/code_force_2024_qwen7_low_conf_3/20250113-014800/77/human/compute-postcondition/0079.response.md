Let's analyze the given for loop and the initial states step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `t` is the original integer value of `data[0]`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`
- `k` is 0
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (k-1)*2]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[(index - (k-1)*2) + 1]`
- `alpha = (n \times m + 1) // 2`
- `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration
- `results` is a list containing tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)` for each iteration

### For Loop Statement:
```
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate over each tuple in the `results` list.
   - Each tuple in `results` is of the form `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

2. **Initial State of `results`:**
   - Since `results` is a list containing tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)`, it needs to have at least one tuple to execute the loop.
   - Therefore, `results` must contain at least one element.

3. **No Other Variables Needed:**
   - The loop itself does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `c`, or `k`.
   - These variables are only used to calculate `alpha` and prepare the `results` list before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the `results` list must contain at least one tuple.

### Final Answer:
State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple**
