The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `r`. Given that `r` was initially the integer value of `data[index]`, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` from previous iterations and the new result, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 5`, `k` must be at least 1, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
