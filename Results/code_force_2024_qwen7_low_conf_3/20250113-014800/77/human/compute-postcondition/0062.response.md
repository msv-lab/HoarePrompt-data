`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, since `k` must be greater than 0, this fact remains unchanged. The only new information is that `r` now holds the integer value of whatever `data[index]` contains.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
