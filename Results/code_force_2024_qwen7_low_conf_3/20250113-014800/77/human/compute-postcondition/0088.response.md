The code `alpha, additional_areas = result` unpacks the tuple `result` into the variables `alpha` and `additional_areas`. Since `result` is the first tuple in the list `results`, the first element of this tuple is assigned to `alpha`, and the second element is assigned to `additional_areas`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple; `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`; `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`.**
