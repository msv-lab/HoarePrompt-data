The code prints the value of `alpha`, which is the first element of the first tuple in `results`. However, the actual value of `alpha` is not printed; instead, the print function outputs its value. The variables `results`, `alpha`, and `additional_areas` are not altered by this code. 

Output State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple, `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`. The value of `alpha` is printed.**
