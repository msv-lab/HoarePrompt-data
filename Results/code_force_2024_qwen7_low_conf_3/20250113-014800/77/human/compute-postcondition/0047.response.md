Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `additional_areas` is now a list containing the previous results and the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`
- `index` is `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 7`
- `k` must be at least 1
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)

### Loop Statement:
```python
for __ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `k` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` must be at least 1.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `k` should be decremented by 1 for the next iteration because the loop runs from 0 to `k-1`.
   - `index` should be updated based on the new value of `k`.

### Updated State:
- Since the loop runs for `k` iterations, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be `k - 1`.
- `index` will be updated as `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 7`, where `k` is now `k - 1`.

### Updated State Calculation:
- New `k`: `k - 1`
- New `index`: `(original index + 2 * ((k - 1) + 1)) + 7 = (original index + 2 * k) + 7`

### Final State:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[new_index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[new_index + 1]`
- `additional_areas` is now a list containing the previous results and the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`
- `new_index` is `(original index + 2 * k) + 7`
- `k` is now `k - 1` (must be at least 0)
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[new_index]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[new_index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)

### Answer:
State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k) + 7]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k) + 8]`, `additional_areas` is now a list containing the previous results and the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is `(original index + 2 * k) + 7`, `k` is now `k - 1` (must be at least 0), `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k) + 7]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k) + 8]`, `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
