According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one tuple.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `results` is a list containing at least one tuple.
- `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`.
- `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `results` must still contain at least one tuple.
- `alpha` remains the same as it is the first element of the first tuple in `results`.
- `additional_areas` remains the same as it is the second element of the first tuple in `results`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `results` must still contain at least one tuple.
- `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`.
- `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple, `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`**
