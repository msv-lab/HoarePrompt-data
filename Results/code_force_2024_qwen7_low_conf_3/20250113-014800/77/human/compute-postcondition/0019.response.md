The code updates the value of `r` to the integer value of `data[index]`. The value of `index` was previously increased by 2, so it is now increased by 2 from its original value. The values of `c`, `additional_areas`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is increased by 2, `k` must be greater than 0**
