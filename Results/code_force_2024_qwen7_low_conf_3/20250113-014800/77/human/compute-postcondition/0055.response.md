`n` is assigned the value of `data[index]` which is converted to an integer. The value of `index` remains as the previous index + 2. Variables `r`, `c`, `m`, `k`, and `results` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `t` must be 1 or more
- `index` is the previous index + 2
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `k` is 0
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` where `alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2`

Output State: **`t` must be 1 or more, `index` is the previous index + 2, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `k` is 0, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` where `alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2`**
