The code initializes `additional_areas` to an empty list. This means that the previously appended results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times are no longer part of `additional_areas`. However, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`, `k` is `data[index + 2]`, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
