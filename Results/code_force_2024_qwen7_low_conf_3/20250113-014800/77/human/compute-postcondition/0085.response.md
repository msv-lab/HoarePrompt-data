The code `print(alpha)` simply prints the value of `alpha`. Since `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, its value remains unchanged. The print statement does not affect the values of any variables or the structure of the `results` list. 

Output State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple, `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`**
