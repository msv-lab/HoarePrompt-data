Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`
   - `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`
   - `index` is increased by 2

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for __ in range(k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs `k` times.
   - The loop variable is not explicitly named, but it is incremented with each iteration.
   - There are no direct changes to `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, or `index` within the loop (since the loop body is omitted).
   - The only change mentioned is that `index` is increased by 2 at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition must still hold true.
   - Since there are no conditions specified in the loop itself, we assume that the loop will continue as long as `k` is positive.
   - Therefore, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `r` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `c` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `additional_areas` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `index` is increased by 2 from its previous value, so if it was `i` before, it is now `i + 2`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`
   - `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`
   - `index` is increased by 2 (from its previous value)
   - `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is increased by 2, `k` must be greater than 0**
