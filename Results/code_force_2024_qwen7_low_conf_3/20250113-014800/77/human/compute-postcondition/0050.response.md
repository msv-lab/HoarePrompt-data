The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given the initial state, the updated value of `index` will be `(original index + 2 * k) + 7 + 2`, which simplifies to `(original index + 2 * k + 9)`. 

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now a list containing the previous results and the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is `(original index + 2 * k + 9)`, `k` is now `k - 1` (must be at least 0), `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k + 9)]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[(original index + 2 * k + 10)]`, `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
