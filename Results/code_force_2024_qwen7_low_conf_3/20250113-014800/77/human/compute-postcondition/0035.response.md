`alpha` is assigned the value \((n \times m + 1) // 2\). This calculation uses the values of `n` and `m`, which are the integer values of `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`, `k` is `data[index + 2]`, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
