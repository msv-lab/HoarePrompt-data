Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`
   - `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times
   - `index` is the original value of `index` + 2 * `k`
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop
   - `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, the loop body is executed, but since the body is omitted, we focus on how the variables change.
   - The key variables that could change are `index` and `k`.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, `k` must be greater than or equal to `t` for the loop to continue.
   - After each iteration, `index` is updated by adding `2 * k` to its current value.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, the values of `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, and `results` do not change directly within the loop.

5. **Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `r` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `c` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `additional_areas` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `index` is updated to `index + 2 * k`.
   - `k` must still be greater than or equal to `t` for the loop to continue.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `t + 1`.
   - `index` is incremented by `2 * k`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2 * `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `t + 1`, and `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`**.
