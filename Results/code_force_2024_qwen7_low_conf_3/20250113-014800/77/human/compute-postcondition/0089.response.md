The code prints the value of `alpha`, which is the first element of the first tuple in `results`. However, the value of `alpha` itself is not changed by this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple; `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`; `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`; print output is `alpha`.**
