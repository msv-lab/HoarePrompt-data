The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `m`. Given that `index` is 2, `data[index + 1]` corresponds to `data[3]`. The initial state indicates that `data` is a list of strings, so `data[3]` is a string. This string is converted to an integer and assigned to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\), `c` is an integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq m\), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
