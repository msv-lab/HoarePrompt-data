`results.append((alpha, additional_areas))` appends a tuple containing `alpha` and `additional_areas` to the list `results`. The variables `r`, `c`, `index`, and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code. The precondition remains unchanged except for the list `results`, which now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2 * `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.**
