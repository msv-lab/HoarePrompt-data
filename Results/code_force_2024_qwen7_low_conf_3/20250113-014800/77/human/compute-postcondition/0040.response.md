The code snippet `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `index` was `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`. After the code is executed, the new value of `index` becomes `(original index + 2 * k) + 5`.

The other variables remain unchanged in their states. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 5`, `k` must be at least 0, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**.
