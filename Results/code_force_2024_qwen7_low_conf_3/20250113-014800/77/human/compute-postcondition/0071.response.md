Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[(index + 2)]`.
- `index` is `index + 4`.
- `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.

### For Loop Statement
```
for __ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `k`:**
   - The loop condition `__ in range(k)` means the loop will run `k` times.
   - Since `k` is initially greater than 0, it can still be a positive integer.
   
2. **Variable `index`:**
   - `index` is incremented by 4 at the end of each iteration (`index = index + 4`).

3. **Variables `r` and `c`:**
   - These are derived from `data[index]` and `data[index + 2]` respectively.
   - For the next iteration, `index` will be incremented by 4, so `r` will be based on `data[index + 4]` and `c` will be based on `data[index + 6]`.

4. **Variable `additional_areas`:**
   - This variable contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.
   - After the current iteration, this list will contain the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for the current values of `r` and `c`.

### Updated States for the Next Iteration
- `k` remains greater than 0 because we are considering the loop to execute one more time.
- `index` will be `index + 4` (from the previous increment).
- `r` will be the integer value of `data[index + 4]`.
- `c` will be the integer value of `data[index + 6]`.
- `additional_areas` will contain the previous contents plus the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

### Final State
State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 6]`; `index` is `index + 8`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 6]`; `index` is `index + 8`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.**
