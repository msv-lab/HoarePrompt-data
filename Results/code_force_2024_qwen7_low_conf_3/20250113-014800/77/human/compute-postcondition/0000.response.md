The given code `input = sys.stdin.read` replaces the built-in `input` function with `sys.stdin.read`. This does not assign any new values to the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, or `c`. It only changes how input is read from the standard input. The original values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ c ≤ m, and each (r, c) represents the coordinates of a fountain in the field; the built-in `input` function is replaced with `sys.stdin.read`**.
