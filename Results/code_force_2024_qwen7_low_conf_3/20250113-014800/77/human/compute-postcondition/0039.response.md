The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `c`. From the initial state, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`. Since `c` was initially the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, after this line of code, `c` will be updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`
- `additional_areas` is an empty list
- `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`
- `k` must be at least 0
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)

After executing the code snippet:
- `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`, `k` must be at least 0, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**.
