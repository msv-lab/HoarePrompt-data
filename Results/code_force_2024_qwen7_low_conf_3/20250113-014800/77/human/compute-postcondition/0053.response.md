The code appends a tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` to the list `results`. The value of `alpha` is calculated as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\). The values of `r`, `c`, `index`, `k`, and the lists `additional_areas` and `data` remain unchanged.

Let's break it down:

1. `results.append((alpha, additional_areas))` appends a tuple to the `results` list.
2. The tuple consists of `alpha` and `additional_areas`.
3. `alpha` is calculated as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\).
4. The values of `r`, `c`, `index`, `k`, and `data` do not change.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration.
- `index` is \((\text{original index} + 4 \times k + 3)\).
- `k` is 0.
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

After executing the code, `results` now contains one more element: the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

The updated values are:
- `alpha = (n \times m + 1) // 2`
- `results` now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, `index` is `\text{original index} + 3`, `k` is 0, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]; alpha = (n \times m + 1) // 2`**
