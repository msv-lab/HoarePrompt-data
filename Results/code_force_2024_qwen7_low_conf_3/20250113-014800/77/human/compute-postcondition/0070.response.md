The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The variables `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, and `additional_areas` are updated as follows:

- `k` remains unchanged because it was only mentioned in the initial state but not used in the code.
- `r` and `c` remain unchanged because they were only mentioned in the initial state but not used in the code.
- `index` is updated to `index + 4`.
- `additional_areas` is updated by appending the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to itself.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[(index + 2)]`; `index` is `index + 4`; `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[(index + 2)]`; `index` is `index + 4`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.**
