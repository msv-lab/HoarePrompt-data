The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly from the caller. However, it seems the problem description might be referring to the constraints and relationships of potential input parameters. Based on the given constraints, the function likely processes data with the following characteristics:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `r` and `c` are integers such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\) and \(1 \leq c \leq m\), representing the coordinates of a fountain in the field.

Given the outputs mentioned do not match the input parameters described, let's focus on the provided output cases instead:

Case_1: The function returns an error message indicating that the number of test cases (`t`) is less than 1.
Case_2: For each valid test case, the function returns the number of fountains in the specified coordinates `(r, c)` within the grid defined by `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it validates `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, and `c` according to their respective constraints. It returns an error message if `t` is less than 1. For each valid test case, it returns the number of fountains at the specified coordinates `(r, c)` within the grid defined by `n` and `m`.**
