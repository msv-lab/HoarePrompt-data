The code snippet updates the value of `k` by assigning it the integer value of `data[index + 2]`. Since `index` is initially 2, `data[index + 2]` refers to `data[4]`. The value of `k` is now the integer value of `data[4]`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\), `c` is an integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq m\), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
