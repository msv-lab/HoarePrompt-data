`c` is reassigned the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer. The previous values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 8`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.**
