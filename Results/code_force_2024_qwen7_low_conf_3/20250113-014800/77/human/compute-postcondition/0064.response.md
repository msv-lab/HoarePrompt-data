The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The previous values of the variables `k`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2.**
