The code `print(' '.join(map(str, additional_areas)))` does the following:
1. It applies the `map` function to convert each element of `additional_areas` to a string.
2. It then joins these string representations with a space character `' '` using `join`.
3. Finally, it prints the resulting string.

Since this code does not modify the variables `results`, `alpha`, or `additional_areas`, only their state is printed to the console. However, the state of these variables remains unchanged. The print statement itself does not affect the variables' values.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple, `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`. The console prints the string representation of `additional_areas` elements joined by a space.**
