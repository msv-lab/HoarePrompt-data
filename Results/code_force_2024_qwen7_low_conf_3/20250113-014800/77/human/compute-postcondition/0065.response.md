The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The variables `k`, `r`, `c`, and `index` are not directly affected by this line of code, except for `index` which is increased by 2. 

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is index + 2, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
