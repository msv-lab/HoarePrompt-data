The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the `additional_areas` list. The variables `r`, `c`, `n`, and `m` are unchanged. The variable `index` is not directly modified in this line of code, only its calculation is referenced. The `additional_areas` list is updated, and the `results` list remains unchanged because no direct operation was performed on it.

Here's the breakdown:

- `additional_areas` is updated to include the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.
- The other variables (`r`, `c`, `n`, `m`, `index`, `k`, `alpha`, and `results`) remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now a list containing the previous results and the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is `(original index + 2 * (k + 1)) + 7`, `k` must be at least 1, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
