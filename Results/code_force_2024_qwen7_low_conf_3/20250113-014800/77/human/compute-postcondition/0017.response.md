`additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))` appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The values of `r` and `c` are derived from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` respectively. The value of `index` is increased by 2. The variables `data`, `n`, and `m` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is increased by 2**
