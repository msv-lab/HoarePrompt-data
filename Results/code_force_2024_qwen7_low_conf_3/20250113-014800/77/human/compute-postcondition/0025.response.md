The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `c`. The previous values of `c` and `index` are updated to these new values, while the other variables remain unchanged.

- `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `index` is updated to its original value plus 2.
- The values of `r`, `additional_areas`, `index` (updated value), and `k` (must be greater than 1) are kept as they are.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 1**
