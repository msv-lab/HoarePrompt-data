Output State: **`t` is the original integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `k` is 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (k-1)*2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[(index - (k-1)*2) + 1]`, `alpha = (n \times m + 1) // 2`, `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, `results` is a list containing tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- After the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged because the loop only reads values from `data` and does not modify `t`.
- The values of `n` and `m` will be the last values read from `data` before the loop ends, specifically `n` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]` and `m` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`.
- Since the loop runs `t` times, `k` becomes 0 after the loop completes.
- The values of `r` and `c` will be the last set of values read from `data` within the inner loop, specifically `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (k-1)*2]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[(index - (k-1)*2) + 1]`.
- `alpha` is calculated as `(n * m + 1) // 2` using the final values of `n` and `m`.
- `additional_areas` is a list that collects the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration of the inner loop.
- `results` is a list that accumulates tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)` for each iteration of the outer loop.
