To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and the initial conditions step by step.

### Initial States:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`
- `additional_areas` is an empty list
- `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`
- `k` is `data[index + 2]`
- `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)

### For Loop Analysis:
The for loop is structured as follows:
```python
for __ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

#### Key Points:
1. The loop runs `k` times.
2. The loop variable is `_` (a dummy variable), meaning we don't care about the value inside the loop.
3. The loop itself does not modify the values of `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, `index`, `k`, `n`, `m`, or `alpha`.

### States to Adjust:
Since the loop doesn't change the values of `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, `index`, `k`, `n`, `m`, or `alpha`, these values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

However, the loop does depend on `k` being a non-negative integer (since `range(k)` would raise a `ValueError` if `k` is negative). Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`, `k` must be at least 0, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**
