`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ c ≤ m, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string based on whitespace, and the built-in `input` function is replaced with `sys.stdin.read`.**
