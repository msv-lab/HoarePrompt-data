`t` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `index` is 0, so `t` is converted from `data[0]` to an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, `r` and `c` are integers such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ c ≤ m, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string based on whitespace, and `index` is 1.**
