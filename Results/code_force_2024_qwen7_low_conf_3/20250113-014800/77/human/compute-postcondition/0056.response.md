The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `m`. From the initial state, we know that `data[index + 1]` is the integer value of `c`, so `m` is set to `c`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `t`, `index`, `r`, `n`, `k`, `results`, and `alpha` are not affected.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be 1 or more, `index` is the previous index + 2, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `m` is the integer value of `c`, `k` is 0, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` where `alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2`**
