The code appends a tuple containing `alpha` and `additional_areas` to the `results` list. However, the value of `alpha` is not specified in the initial state, and the exact nature of `additional_areas` is also not detailed. We know that `additional_areas` is a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times. 

The impact of this code is that `results` now contains one more element, which is a tuple with `alpha` as the first element and `additional_areas` as the second element.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (k-1)*2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[(index - (k-1)*2) + 1]`, `index` is `index + (k*2) - 2`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended `k` times, `results` is a list with one additional tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` appended to it.**
