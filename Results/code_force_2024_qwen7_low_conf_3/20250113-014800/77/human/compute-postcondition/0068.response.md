The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `c` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Since `index` was updated to `index + 2` before this line, the new value of `c` will be the integer value of `data[(index + 2)]`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[(index + 2)]`; `index` is `index + 2`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
