The code increments the value of `index` by 3. Initially, `index` is set to 2, so after the increment, `index` will be 5. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq n\), `c` is an integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq m\), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list**
