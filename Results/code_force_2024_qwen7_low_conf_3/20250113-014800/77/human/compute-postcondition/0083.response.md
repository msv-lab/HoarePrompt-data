According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one tuple.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `results` is a list containing at least one tuple.
- `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`.
- `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `results` must still contain at least one tuple. The values of `alpha` and `additional_areas` will be updated based on the next tuple in the list if there is one.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one tuple.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple, `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`**
