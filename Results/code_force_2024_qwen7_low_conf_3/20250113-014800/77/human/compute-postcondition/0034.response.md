The code `index += 3` increments the value of `index` by 3. The previous value of `index` was `original index + 2 * k`, so after the increment, the new value of `index` is `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2 * k) - 1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` repeated `k` times, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 3`, `k` is `data[index + 2]`, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
