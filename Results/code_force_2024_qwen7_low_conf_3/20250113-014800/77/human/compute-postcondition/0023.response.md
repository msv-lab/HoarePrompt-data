According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is the integer value of `data[index-2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, and `k` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 1 because if `k` was exactly 1, it would mean that we just completed the last iteration. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 1 to allow another iteration.

State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index-2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 1**
