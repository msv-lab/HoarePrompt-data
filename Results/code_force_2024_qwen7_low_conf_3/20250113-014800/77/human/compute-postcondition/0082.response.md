The code `print(' '.join(map(str, additional_areas)))` will convert each element of `additional_areas` to a string and join them with a space. This operation does not affect the values of `results`, `alpha`, or `additional_areas`. It only prints the elements of `additional_areas` separated by spaces.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing at least one tuple, `alpha` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `additional_areas` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`, the elements of `additional_areas` are printed separated by spaces.**
