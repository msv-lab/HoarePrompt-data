`r` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The previous value of `r` was the integer value of `data[index + 4]`, but now it is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 6]`; `index` is `index + 8`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its previous contents.**
