The code snippet `additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))` appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the `additional_areas` list. The values of `r`, `c`, `n`, and `m` remain the same as they were before the code execution. The `index` is updated to `(original index + 2 * k) + 5`, and the `additional_areas` list is modified by appending the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is now `(original index + 2 * k) + 5`, `k` must be at least 0, `results` contains the appended tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\)**.
