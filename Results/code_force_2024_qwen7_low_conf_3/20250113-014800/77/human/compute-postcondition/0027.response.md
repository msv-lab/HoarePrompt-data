The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to `additional_areas`. The values of `r`, `c`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 2`, and `k` remains greater than 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `additional_areas` contains the appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the original result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `k` must be greater than 1**
