`c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `c`. However, we know that `c` is now an integer obtained from converting the element at the index `index + 1` of the list `data`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
