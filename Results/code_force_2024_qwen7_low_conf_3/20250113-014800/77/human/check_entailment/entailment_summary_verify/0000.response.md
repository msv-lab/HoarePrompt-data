### Reasoning:

1. **Calculation of `alpha`:**
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the formula `(n * m + 1) // 2` is always incorrect. Let's re-evaluate this formula in light of the problem constraints and conditions:
     - The goal is to maximize the size of Alice's plot while ensuring that it includes the cell `(n, 1)` and excludes the cell `(1, m)`.
     - If we consider the grid and the path Alice must take, the optimal strategy is to split the grid such that Alice gets the majority of cells. For a grid of size \( n \times m \), the maximum size of Alice's plot without any fountains is indeed \((n \times m + 1) // 2\). This formula correctly accounts for the division of the grid.
     - The formula `(n * m + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the midpoint of the total number of cells, ensuring that Alice gets the largest possible portion of the grid, considering the constraints.

2. **Calculation of `additional_areas`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the additional area that can be added to Alice's plot if she receives a specific fountain. This calculation is based on the Manhattan distance from the fountain to the cell `(n, 1)`, adjusted by the diagonal distance.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly handles the distance calculation, which determines how much additional territory Alice can claim if she receives a particular fountain.
   - The function `func_2` correctly iterates over each test case, calculates `alpha`, and computes the additional areas for each fountain. It then prints the results as required.

### Conclusion:
Based on the re-evaluation of the code and the problem description, the original assessment was overly critical and missed the correctness of the core logic. The program correctly implements the necessary calculations for `alpha` and the additional areas. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
