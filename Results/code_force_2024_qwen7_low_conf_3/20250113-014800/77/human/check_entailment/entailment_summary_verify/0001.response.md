### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to calculate the maximum area Alice can own when dividing a rectangular field of size \(n \times m\), considering \(k\) fountains placed in different cells.
   - Alice starts from any free cell on the left or top side and moves either down or right until she reaches the right or bottom side.
   - Bob owns the cells that include the fountain at \((n, 1)\) and Alice owns the rest.
   - Bob can give one of his fountains to Alice, and the program needs to output the maximum possible area Alice can own without and with each fountain.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the additional area Alice can gain if she gets a specific fountain.
   - The formula `abs(r + c - (n + 1))` calculates the Manhattan distance from the fountain to the diagonal line \((n, 1)\) to \((1, m)\).
   - The division by 2 ensures that the area is halved, which is correct as Alice can only take half of the cells along the path.
   - However, the function `func_1` returns `max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)`, which might be problematic if the diagonal distance is negative or very large.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It calculates `alpha` as \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\), which is the initial area Alice can own without any fountains.
   - The function then calculates the additional area for each fountain using `func_1` and stores these values in a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results in the required format.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The code handles large inputs within the constraints, but there is a potential issue with the `func_1` formula. Specifically, the Manhattan distance should always be positive, and the division by 2 ensures that Alice gets half of the cells.
   - However, the `max` function in `func_1` is unnecessary because the absolute value ensures that the distance is always positive, and the division by 2 will always yield a non-negative result.

### Conclusion:

- The main issue lies in `func_1`. The use of `max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)` is redundant because the `abs` function already ensures the distance is non-negative. The correct formula should simply be `diagonal_distance // 2`.

- Given this, the overall logic and structure of the program are correct, and the edge cases are handled properly. However, the minor redundancy in `func_1` can be simplified.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct in terms of functionality and meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement. The minor redundancy in `func_1` does not affect the correctness of the solution.
