Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the maximum size of Alice's plot and the additional areas that would be added if Bob gives Alice a specific fountain. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Calculation of `alpha`:**
   - The formula used to calculate `alpha` (`(n * m + 1) // 2`) is incorrect. For the given constraints, this formula does not always yield the correct maximum size of Alice's plot. Specifically, if `n` and `m` are both odd, this formula would give the wrong result. For example, for a field of size \(3 \times 3\) with no fountains, the correct `alpha` should be 4, but the formula would give 5.

2. **Calculation of `additional_areas`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum additional area that can be added by a fountain, but it does not correctly handle the edge cases and the specific conditions described in the problem. The logic in `func_1` seems to be based on a simplified distance calculation which does not fully account for the grid structure and the constraints of the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
