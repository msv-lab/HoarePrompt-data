Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem:** The goal is to calculate the maximum area Alice can own under the given constraints. If Bob does not give any fountain to Alice, the initial calculation of the area for Alice (`alpha`) is correct. Additionally, the function `func_1` calculates the additional area Alice can gain by receiving a specific fountain. The approach taken in `func_2` correctly reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the required results.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the additional area Alice can gain if she gets a specific fountain.
   - The logic used here is based on the distance of the fountain from the diagonal path `(n,1)` to `(1,m)`, which is calculated as `abs(r + c - (n + 1))`.
   - The formula `max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)` ensures that the value is non-negative and halved, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function reads input from standard input, which is split into tokens.
   - It processes each test case separately, calculating `alpha` and the additional areas for each fountain.
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The code handles large inputs within the constraints (`2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5`).
   - The input processing and output formatting are correct according to the problem's specifications.

Given this analysis, the provided Python program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
