Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - This function calculates the maximum of zero and half of the absolute difference between the sum of the fountain's coordinates `(r + c)` and the sum of the field's dimensions `(n + 1)`, rounded down to the nearest integer.
   - The formula used ensures that the result is always non-negative and is meaningful in the context of determining the potential area Alice can control when a fountain is removed from Bob's control and given to her.
   - Edge cases: Since the function uses the formula `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`, it inherently handles cases where the result might be negative by setting it to zero.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function processes a series of test cases where each test case involves the following steps:
     - Reading input data.
     - Calculating the base area \(\alpha\) that Alice can control without any fountains moved to her.
     - For each fountain, calculating the additional area Alice can control if she gets that fountain using `func_1`.
     - Storing these additional areas in a list for each fountain.
     - Printing the results for each test case, including the base area \(\alpha\) and the additional areas for each fountain.
   - The overall logic of the function aligns with the problem statement:
     - It correctly calculates the base area \(\alpha\) as \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\).
     - It correctly calculates the additional area for each fountain using `func_1`.
     - It handles the reading and processing of input data correctly.
   - Edge cases: The function handles large input values (up to \(10^9\)) and the number of test cases and fountains (up to \(2 \times 10^5\)) within reasonable limits.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.
   - It processes multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It handles the calculation of the base area and the additional areas for each fountain accurately.
   - There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that the provided functions do not handle properly.

Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and handles all necessary computations accurately.

Correctness: **True**
