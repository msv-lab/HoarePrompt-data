Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here’s a detailed explanation of why it fails:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `alpha`**:
   - The problem description states that `alpha` should be the maximum size of the plot that can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. The formula given in the program is `alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2`. However, this formula does not account for the actual positions of the fountains. 
   - According to the problem description, `alpha` should be calculated as the sum of the sizes of the two parts of the field divided by Alice’s path plus the contributions from the fountains. Specifically, if Bob does not give any fountains to Alice, `alpha` should be the size of the part of the field that Alice would own without any interference from the fountains.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Additional Areas (`a_i`)**:
   - The `additional_areas` list is calculated by calling `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each fountain. The function `func_1` calculates the additional area Alice can gain if she receives a particular fountain.
   - However, the problem description requires that `a_i` should represent the change in the size of Alice's plot after receiving the `i-th` fountain. The current implementation does not correctly compute this value. The function `func_1` simply returns a value based on the distance of the fountain from the diagonal, which does not reflect the actual change in the size of Alice's plot.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the value of `alpha` followed by the `additional_areas` list. This matches the required format, but the values themselves are incorrect due to the reasons mentioned above.

### Example Counter-Example

Consider the following input:

```
1
2 2 3
1 1
1 2
2 2
```

- According to the problem description, the correct output should be:
  ```
  1
  1 0 1 
  ```

- However, the current program will output:
  ```
  2
  0 0 0 
  ```

This shows that the program incorrectly calculates both `alpha` and `additional_areas`.

### Conclusion

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
