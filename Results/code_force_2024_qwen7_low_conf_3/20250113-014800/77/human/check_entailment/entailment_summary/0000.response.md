### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it meets the problem description correctly. We will analyze the logic of the functions and their interactions.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum area Alice can obtain if a fountain is not on her path.
   - It uses the formula `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)` where `(r, c)` are the coordinates of the fountain, `n` is the number of rows, and `m` is the number of columns.
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the optimal path for Alice avoids the fountain by staying as far away as possible in terms of the Manhattan distance.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the initial maximum area Alice can get (`alpha`) without considering any fountain.
   - It then iterates over each fountain, calculates the additional area Alice would gain if she could place that fountain on her side using `func_1`, and stores these values.
   - Finally, it prints the initial `alpha` and the additional areas for each fountain.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The program should handle up to `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it should:
  1. Calculate the initial maximum area Alice can get (`alpha`).
  2. Determine the additional area Alice gains for each fountain if she can place it on her side.
  3. Print the results for each test case.

#### Verification:
- The calculation of `alpha` is correct. The formula `(n * m + 1) // 2` ensures that Alice gets the maximum possible area when no fountains are considered.
- The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to calculate the additional area for each fountain.
- The overall structure of `func_2` is designed to read input, process each test case, and output the required results.

Given that the functions are logically sound and correctly implement the required logic, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
