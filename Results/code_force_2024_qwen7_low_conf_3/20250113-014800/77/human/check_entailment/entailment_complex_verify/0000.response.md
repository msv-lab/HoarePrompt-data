### Reasoning:

Let's break down the solution step-by-step and compare it with the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

#### 1. Calculation of `alpha`:
- The original program calculates `alpha` using the formula:
  \[
  \alpha = \left\lfloor \frac{n \times m + 1}{2} \right\rfloor
  \]
- This formula is indeed correct for calculating the maximum number of cells Alice can own if she starts from the left or top side and moves down or right to the right or bottom side, respectively. It ensures that Alice gets exactly half of the cells plus one (if the total number of cells is odd).
- The provided example values in the problem statement support this formula. For instance, for a \(3 \times 3\) grid, the total number of cells is 9, and the correct `alpha` is 5, which matches the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{9 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = 5\).

#### 2. Calculation of `additional_areas`:
- The function `func_1` calculates the additional area that can be added to Alice's plot if she receives a specific fountain.
- The formula used in `func_1` is:
  \[
  \text{diagonal\_distance} = \left| r + c - (n + 1) \right|
  \]
  \[
  \text{additional\_area} = \max\left(\frac{\text{diagonal\_distance}}{2}, 0\right)
  \]
- This formula calculates the maximum additional area that can be added to Alice's plot based on the position of the fountain. It considers the distance from the fountain to the diagonal that separates Alice's and Bob's plots.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly accounts for the positions of the fountains relative to the grid and the diagonal boundary.

#### Detailed Example:
Consider a \(3 \times 3\) grid with the following fountains:
- Fountain at (1, 1)
- Fountain at (1, 2)
- Fountain at (2, 2)

- For the fountain at (1, 1):
  \[
  \text{diagonal\_distance} = \left| 1 + 1 - (3 + 1) \right| = 2
  \]
  \[
  \text{additional\_area} = \max\left(\frac{2}{2}, 0\right) = 1
  \]

- For the fountain at (1, 2):
  \[
  \text{diagonal\_distance} = \left| 1 + 2 - (3 + 1) \right| = 0
  \]
  \[
  \text{additional\_area} = \max\left(\frac{0}{2}, 0\right) = 0
  \]

- For the fountain at (2, 2):
  \[
  \text{diagonal\_distance} = \left| 2 + 2 - (3 + 1) \right| = 0
  \]
  \[
  \text{additional\_area} = \max\left(\frac{0}{2}, 0\right) = 0
  \]

The results match the expected values for the given examples in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and the problem statement, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is **inaccurate**. The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum size of Alice's plot and the additional areas that would be added if Bob gives Alice a specific fountain.

### Final:
**True**
