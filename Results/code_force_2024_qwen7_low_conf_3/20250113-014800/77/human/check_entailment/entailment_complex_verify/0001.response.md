### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the maximum area Alice can own by dividing the field into two parts, with one part belonging to Alice and the other to Bob.
   - Alice starts her path on the left or top side and moves down or right until she reaches the right or bottom side.
   - Bob keeps his fountains but can give one of them to Alice, which affects the division of the field.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the additional area Alice can gain by receiving a specific fountain.
   - The formula `abs(r + c - (n + 1))` calculates the diagonal distance from the fountain to the diagonal path from `(n, 1)` to `(1, m)`.
   - The value `max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)` ensures the additional area is non-negative and halved, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the initial area `alpha` that Alice can own without any fountains.
   - It iterates through each fountain, calculating the additional area Alice can gain by receiving that fountain.
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The code handles large inputs within the constraints (`2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5`).
   - The input processing and output formatting are correct according to the problem's specifications.

5. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_1` correctly calculates the additional area for each fountain.
   - The main function `func_2` correctly processes each test case, calculates `alpha`, and computes the additional areas for each fountain.
   - The overall logic and flow of the program are consistent with the problem statement and the provided examples.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_2` assumes that the input is read from standard input, which is correct for this problem. However, it should handle potential errors in input, such as invalid values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, and `c`.
   - The code does not explicitly handle edge cases like when `n` or `m` are at their minimum values (2). While the current implementation works for the given constraints, it should be noted that the formula for `alpha` is derived under these constraints and may need additional validation for very small values.

Given this detailed evaluation, the provided Python program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
