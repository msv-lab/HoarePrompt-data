### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the maximum additional area that can be added to Alice's plot if she gets a specific fountain. The formula used is:
\[ \text{diagonal\_distance} = \left| r + c - (n + 1) \right| \]
\[ \text{additional\_area} = \max\left(\frac{\text{diagonal\_distance}}{2}, 0\right) \]

This formula attempts to measure the distance along the diagonal from the fountain to the boundary of the field. However, it does not fully capture the grid structure and the specific constraints of the problem. The function seems to simplify the problem too much by focusing only on the diagonal distance without considering the actual path Alice can take.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` reads the input and processes it to compute the results for each test case. Here are the key steps:
1. Read the input data.
2. For each test case, calculate `alpha` using the formula \((n \times m + 1) // 2\).
3. For each fountain, compute the additional area using `func_1`.
4. Store the results in a list and print them.

The main issues with the implementation are:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `alpha`:**
   - The formula \((n \times m + 1) // 2\) is indeed incorrect. This formula would not always yield the correct maximum size of Alice's plot. For example, for a \(3 \times 3\) field with no fountains, the correct `alpha` should be 4, but the formula would give 5. The correct approach should consider the optimal path that maximizes the number of cells Alice can capture.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Additional Areas:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the edge cases and the specific conditions of the problem. The logic does not fully account for the grid structure and the constraints that Alice must move either down or right. The current implementation assumes a simplified distance metric, which is not sufficient.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The original assessment correctly identifies these issues.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the maximum size of Alice's plot and the additional areas that would be added if Bob gives Alice a specific fountain.

**Final: False**
