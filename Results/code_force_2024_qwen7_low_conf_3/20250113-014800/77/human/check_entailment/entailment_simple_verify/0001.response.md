### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to calculate the maximum area Alice can own when dividing the field, given the constraints. If Bob does not give any fountain to Alice, the initial calculation of the area for Alice (`alpha`) is correct. Additionally, the function `func_1` calculates the additional area Alice can gain by receiving a specific fountain. The approach taken in `func_2` correctly reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the required results.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the additional area Alice can gain if she gets a specific fountain. The logic used here is based on the distance of the fountain from the diagonal path `(n,1)` to `(1,m)`, which is calculated as `abs(r + c - (n + 1))`.
   - The formula `max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)` ensures that the value is non-negative and halved, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which is split into tokens.
   - It processes each test case separately, calculating `alpha` and the additional areas for each fountain.
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The code handles large inputs within the constraints (`2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5`).
   - The input processing and output formatting are correct according to the problem's specifications.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, we notice that there is a flaw in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the additional area Alice can gain if she receives a specific fountain. Let's break it down:

- **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The formula `abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2` does not accurately reflect the additional area Alice can gain. The formula should consider the positions relative to the diagonal path more carefully.
  - For instance, if a fountain is placed at (1, 1), it would incorrectly calculate the additional area as `0`, which is not correct.

To correctly calculate the additional area, we need to consider the positions of the fountains relative to the diagonal path and how they affect the division of the field. A more accurate approach would involve considering the distances from the fountain to the boundaries of the field and adjusting the area accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the additional area Alice can gain if she receives a specific fountain. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program cannot be maintained.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
