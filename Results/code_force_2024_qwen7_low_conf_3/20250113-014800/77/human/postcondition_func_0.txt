The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `fountain` containing the coordinates `(r, c)` of a fountain on a field with dimensions `n` by `m`, and returns the calculated value based on the formula `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`. 

This function calculates the maximum of zero and half of the absolute difference between the sum of the fountain's coordinates `(r + c)` and the sum of the field's dimensions `(n + 1)`, rounded down to the nearest integer. The function handles the case where the result could be negative by ensuring it is at least zero. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but it implicitly handles the minimum possible value of zero for the result. The function does not modify any external state and only uses the provided parameters to compute its output.
