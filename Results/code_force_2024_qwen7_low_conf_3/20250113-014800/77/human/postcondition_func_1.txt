The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves validating grid dimensions \(n\) and \(m\), and the number of fountains \(k\) within those dimensions. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of fountains \((r, c)\) and calculates two values: the total number of fountains in the grid plus one, halved, and the additional areas affected by each fountain. These values are stored in a list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated values for each test case, including the total number of fountains and the additional areas affected by each fountain. Potential edge cases include invalid input values for \(t\), \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(r\), and \(c\), which would result in an error message being printed.
