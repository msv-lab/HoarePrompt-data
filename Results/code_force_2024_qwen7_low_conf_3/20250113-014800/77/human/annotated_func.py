#State of the program right berfore the function call: fountain is a tuple containing two integers (r, c) representing the coordinates of a fountain on the field, n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the field where 2 <= n, m <= 10^9.
def func_1(fountain, n, m):
    r, c = fountain
    diagonal_distance = abs(r + c - (n + 1))
    return max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)
    #max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `fountain` containing the coordinates `(r, c)` of a fountain on a field with dimensions `n` by `m`, and returns the calculated value based on the formula `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`. 

This function calculates the maximum of zero and half of the absolute difference between the sum of the fountain's coordinates `(r + c)` and the sum of the field's dimensions `(n + 1)`, rounded down to the nearest integer. The function handles the case where the result could be negative by ensuring it is at least zero. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but it implicitly handles the minimum possible value of zero for the result. The function does not modify any external state and only uses the provided parameters to compute its output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, r and c are integers such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ c ≤ m, and each (r, c) represents the coordinates of a fountain in the field.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves validating grid dimensions \(n\) and \(m\), and the number of fountains \(k\) within those dimensions. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of fountains \((r, c)\) and calculates two values: the total number of fountains in the grid plus one, halved, and the additional areas affected by each fountain. These values are stored in a list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated values for each test case, including the total number of fountains and the additional areas affected by each fountain. Potential edge cases include invalid input values for \(t\), \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(r\), and \(c\), which would result in an error message being printed.
