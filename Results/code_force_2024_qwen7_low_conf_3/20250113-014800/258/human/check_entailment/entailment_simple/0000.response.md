Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). Let's break down why:

1. **Bit Extraction and Assignment**: The program correctly extracts the bits of \(x\) and reverses their order into the `bits` list. Then, it constructs an array `a` based on these bits:
   - If `bits[i]` is `True`, `a[i]` is set to `1`.
   - If `bits[i+1]` is `True`, `a[i+1]` is set to `-1`.

2. **Validation Requirement**: The problem description explicitly states that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). However, the current implementation does not enforce this constraint. For instance, if `bits` is `[1, 0, 1]`, the resulting `a` would be `[1, -1]`. Here, `a[0]` and `a[1]` are non-zero, violating the constraint.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements are present in the constructed array `a`. One way to achieve this could be by iterating through the `bits` list and setting values in `a` in a way that avoids consecutive non-zero elements.

Hereâ€™s a modified version of the function that adheres to the requirement:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if (x == 1):
        return [1]

    bits = []
    while x > 0:
        bit = x & 1
        bits.append(bit)
        x >>= 1

    n = len(bits)
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if bits[i]:
            a[i] = 1

    # Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] == 1 and a[i + 1] == 1:
            a[i + 1] = -1

    return a
```

This modification ensures that if there are consecutive ones in the `bits` list, the next one is flipped to `-1`, thus avoiding consecutive non-zero elements in `a`.

Given this analysis, the original program does not fully meet the requirements and hence is marked as **False**.
