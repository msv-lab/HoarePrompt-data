Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing an array of integers \(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}\) such that:
   - Each \(a_i\) is either 1, 0, or -1.
   - The sum of the elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals \(x\).
   - No two consecutive non-zero elements exist.

2. The provided function `func_1` has some issues with how it constructs the array `a`:
   - For `x` greater than 1, it correctly extracts the bits of `x` and appends them to `bits`.
   - However, the logic to set the values of `a` is flawed. Specifically, setting `a[i+1] = -1` when the next bit is 1 does not ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. This approach can result in sequences like `[1, -1]` which violate the constraint.

3. A correct approach would involve:
   - Extracting the bits of `x`.
   - Setting the corresponding positions in `a` to 1.
   - Ensuring that no two consecutive positions have non-zero values unless they are 1 and -1 respectively.

4. The provided function does not ensure that the array `a` meets all the required constraints, particularly the constraint about consecutive non-zero elements.

Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not guarantee that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the generated array.
