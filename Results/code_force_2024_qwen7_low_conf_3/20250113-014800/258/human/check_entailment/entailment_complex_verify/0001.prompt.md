You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    return a
    #The program returns a list 'a' of length 'n', where each element a[i] is 1 if bits[i] is True, and a[i+1] is -1 if bits[i+1] is True, given that 'bits' is a list containing all the bits of the original value of x (which is 0) in reverse order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). It returns either a list containing only the element `[1]` if `x` is 1, or a list `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is 1 if the `i-th` bit from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) of `x` is True, and `a[i+1]` is -1 if the `(i+1)-th` bit is True. The list `a` is derived from the reversed bit representation of `x`.

The function processes the integer `x` by first checking if it is 1. If so, it returns `[1]`. Otherwise, it extracts the bits of `x` into a list `bits`, reverses them, and then constructs the list `a` based on these bits. Specifically, for each bit in `bits`, if the current bit is 1, the corresponding element in `a` is set to 1; if the next bit is 1, the next element in `a` is set to -1. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the constructed list `a`, which represents the bit pattern of `x` in a specific manner as described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program `func_1`, we need to ensure that it adheres to the problem requirements and constraints. Let's break down the program step by step and check against the given problem description.

1. **Base Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the base case where `x` is 1. It returns `[1]`, which satisfies the condition \(1 \cdot 2^0 = 1\).

2. **Bitwise Operations**: The program uses bitwise operations to extract the bits of `x`. Specifically, it iteratively extracts the least significant bit (`x & 1`) and appends it to the list `bits`. This ensures that `bits` contains the binary representation of `x`.

3. **Array Construction**: The program constructs the array `a` of length `n` (where `n` is the number of bits). For each bit position `i`, if `bits[i]` is non-zero, it sets `a[i]` to 1. If `bits[i + 1]` is non-zero, it sets `a[i + 1]` to -1. However, this logic is flawed because it can lead to consecutive non-zero elements, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints.

4. **Output Length and Validity**: The program returns the array `a`, but the length of `a` might not necessarily satisfy the condition \(1 \le n \le 32\) without additional checks or adjustments.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program fails to ensure that no two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero. Here’s a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider `x = 14`. The binary representation of 14 is `1110`. According to the program, it would produce:
- `bits = [0, 1, 1, 1]`
- `a = [1, -1, 0, 0]`

This output violates the constraint that there should not exist an index `0 \le i \le n - 2` such that both `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` are non-zero.

Correctness: **False**

A corrected version of the program should construct the array `a` such that it avoids consecutive non-zero elements and ensures the length is within the specified bounds.
