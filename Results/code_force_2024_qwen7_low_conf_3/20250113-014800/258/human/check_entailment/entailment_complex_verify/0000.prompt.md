You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is 0, `bits` is a list containing all the bits of the original value of `x` in reverse order, `n` is the length of the `bits` list, and `a` is a list of `n` elements where `a[i]` is 1 if `bits[i]` is True, and `a[i+1]` is -1 if `bits[i+1]` is True.
    return a
    #The program returns a list 'a' of length 'n', where each element a[i] is 1 if bits[i] is True, and a[i+1] is -1 if bits[i+1] is True, given that 'bits' is a list containing all the bits of the original value of x (which is 0) in reverse order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). It returns either a list containing only the element `[1]` if `x` is 1, or a list `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is 1 if the `i-th` bit from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) of `x` is True, and `a[i+1]` is -1 if the `(i+1)-th` bit is True. The list `a` is derived from the reversed bit representation of `x`.

The function processes the integer `x` by first checking if it is 1. If so, it returns `[1]`. Otherwise, it extracts the bits of `x` into a list `bits`, reverses them, and then constructs the list `a` based on these bits. Specifically, for each bit in `bits`, if the current bit is 1, the corresponding element in `a` is set to 1; if the next bit is 1, the next element in `a` is set to -1. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the constructed list `a`, which represents the bit pattern of `x` in a specific manner as described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not satisfy the requirement that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). Let's consider the example input `x = 14`. The expected output for this input is `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]`, but the program generates `[0, 1, -1, 0, 0]` instead.

Here is a breakdown of why the program fails:

1. The program correctly converts the integer to its binary representation and appends the bits to the `bits` list.
2. It then initializes an array `a` with zeros of the same length as `bits`.
3. It iterates through the `bits` list and sets the corresponding elements in `a` based on whether the bit is `1` or `0`.
4. However, when setting the values, it incorrectly allows consecutive non-zero values. For example, for `x = 14` (binary `1110`), the program generates `[0, 1, -1, 0, 0]`, which violates the rule that no two consecutive non-zero values should exist.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after setting the value for `a[i]` based on `bit[i]`, it checks if the next bit (`bit[i+1]`) is also set and adjusts accordingly to avoid consecutive non-zero values.
