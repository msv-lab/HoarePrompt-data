Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided function summary and the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function Summary Recap**:
   - The function `func_1` processes a positive integer `x` and returns a list `a` that adheres to the constraints specified in the problem description.
   - It first checks if `x` is 1. If so, it returns `[1]`.
   - Otherwise, it converts `x` to its binary representation, reverses the bits, and constructs the list `a` such that if a bit is 1, the corresponding element in `a` is 1, and if the next bit is 1, the next element in `a` is -1.

2. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `x` is 1 by returning `[1]`.
   - It processes the bits of `x` and constructs the list `a` by iterating through the reversed bits.
   - However, the key issue lies in the construction of `a`. The function does not ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist in the resulting list `a`.

3. **Revisiting the Example**:
   - For `x = 14` (binary `1110`), the expected output is `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]`.
   - The function generates `[0, 1, -1, 0, 0]`, which is incorrect because it violates the constraint that there should not be two consecutive non-zero values.

4. **Proposed Fix**:
   - To ensure the constraint is met, we need to modify the loop that constructs the list `a`. Specifically, after setting `a[i]` to 1 if `bit[i]` is 1, we should check the next bit and adjust `a[i+1]` to 0 if necessary.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the constraint that no two consecutive non-zero values should exist in the list `a`. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
