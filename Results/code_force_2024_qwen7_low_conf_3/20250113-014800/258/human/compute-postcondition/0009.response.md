The code `bit = x & 1` sets the variable `bit` to be the least significant bit of `x`. Since `x & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation between `x` and 1, it effectively checks the last bit of `x`. Given that `x` is a positive integer and \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\), the value of `bit` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether the last bit of `x` is 0 or 1.

The states of the other variables (`x` and `bits`) remain unchanged. Thus, the updated states are:

- `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and \(x \neq 1\);
- `bits` is a list containing one element which is either 0 or 1;
- `bit` is the least significant bit of `x`, which is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and \(x \neq 1\); `bits` is a list containing one element which is either 0 or 1; `bit` is the least significant bit of `x`, which is either 0 or 1.**
