Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `bits` is a list containing all the bits of the original value of `x` in reverse order, `n` is at least 2, and `a` is a list of `n` elements, each set to 0 except for `a[i]` which is now 1, where `bits[i]` is True. If `bits[i]` is True, `a[i]` remains 1. Otherwise, the condition does not change any variables.***
