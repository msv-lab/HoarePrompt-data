The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). The function returns either:

- A list containing only the element `[1]` in Case_1.
- A list 'a' of length 'n', where each element `a[i]` is 1 if `bits[i]` is True, and `a[i+1]` is -1 if `bits[i+1]` is True, given that `bits` is a list containing all the bits of the original value of `x` (which is 0) in reverse order in Case_2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `x` within the specified range and return either `[1]` or a list 'a' based on the reversed bit representation of `x`.
