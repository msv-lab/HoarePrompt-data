The code `bits.append(bit)` appends the value of `bit` (which is either 0 or 1) to the list `bits`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and the value of `bit` remains unchanged as well. The initial state of `bits` being an empty list means after appending `bit`, `bits` will contain the single element `bit`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\) and \(x \neq 1\); `bits` is a list containing one element which is either 0 or 1; `bit` is either 0 or 1.**
