Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `x` where \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). For each test case, it computes a sequence of integers `r` where each element is either 0, 1, or -1. The sequence is constructed by repeatedly taking the remainder of `x` when divided by 2, adjusting `x`, and appending the result to `r`. Specifically, the final element of `r` is 0 if `x` is a power of 2, or -k where k is the largest integer such that `x` is divisible by \(2^k\). The function prints the length of `r` followed by the elements of `r` for each test case.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is a power of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...), the final element of `r` will be 0.
- If `x` is odd, the sequence `r` will end with -1.
- If `x` is even but not a power of 2, the sequence `r` will end with a value less than -1, indicating the largest power of 2 that divides `x`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is 1, which is a special case since it is both a positive integer and a power of 2. In this case, the sequence `r` should have a single element, 0. However, the current implementation still works correctly for `x = 1`.
