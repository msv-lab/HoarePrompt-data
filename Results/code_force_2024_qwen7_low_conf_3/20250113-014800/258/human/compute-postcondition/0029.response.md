The code `a[i + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element `a[i + 1]`. Based on the initial state, `a` is a list of `n` elements, each initially set to `0`, except for `a[i]` which is `1` if `bits[i]` is `True`.

Since `bits` is a list containing all the bits of the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `bits[i]` being `True` means `a[i]` is `1`, this assignment will change the value of `a[i + 1]` to `-1`. All other elements of `a` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` is a list of `n` elements, with `a[i]` still `1` and `a[i + 1]` now `-1`, and all other elements still `0`.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `bits` is a list containing all the bits of the original value of `x` in reverse order, `n` is at least 2, and `a` is a list of `n` elements, each set to 0 except for `a[i]` which is 1 and `a[i + 1]` which is -1.**
