The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it is implied that the function will process a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)) and a positive integer `x` (where \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\)). The function will handle these test cases and return different outputs based on the values of `t` and `x`. 

Given the constraints and the need to handle multiple test cases, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each, but since the specific output logic is not provided, we focus on the parameter acceptance.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes test cases consisting of integers `t` and `x` where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\), and returns results based on these inputs.**
