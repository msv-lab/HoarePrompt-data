`x` is shifted right by 1 bit, which means the least significant bit of `x` is removed. The value of `x` is divided by 2 (integer division). The variable `bits` and `bit` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `bits[0]` remains either 0 or 1, and `bit` remains either 0 or 1. The updated value of `x` is `x // 2`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and \(x \neq 1\); `bits` is a list containing one element which is either 0 or 1; `bit` is either 0 or 1; `x` is equal to its original value divided by 2.**
