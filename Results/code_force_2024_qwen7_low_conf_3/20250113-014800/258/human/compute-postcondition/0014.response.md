The code `bits.append(bit)` appends the value of `bit` (which is the least significant bit of `x`) to the list `bits`. Given the initial state, `bit` is already set to `x & 1`, and `bits` contains two elements: the first element is either 0 or 1, and the second element is the least significant bit of `x`.

Since `bits.append(bit)` simply adds `bit` to the end of the list `bits`, the new state of `bits` will be a list with three elements. The first two elements remain unchanged, and the third element is `bit`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \frac{x}{2} < 2^{28}\) and \(x \neq 1\) and `x` is greater than 1; `bits` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are either 0 or 1 and the third element is the least significant bit of `x`; `bit` is the least significant bit of `x`, which is either 0 or 1.**
