Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `bits` is a list containing all the bits of the original value of `x` in reverse order, `n` is at least 2, and `a` is a list of `n` elements, each set to 0 except for `a[i]` which is 1. If `bits[i + 1]` is True, then `a[i + 1]` is set to -1. Otherwise, `a[i + 1]` remains 0.***
