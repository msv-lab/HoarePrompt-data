The code appends the least significant bit (`bit`) of `x` to the list `bits`. The initial state is given as follows:
- `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and \(x \neq 1\)
- `bits` is a list containing one element which is either 0 or 1
- `bit` is the least significant bit of `x`, which is either 0 or 1

After executing the line `bits.append(bit)`:
- The list `bits` will now contain two elements: the original element and the new least significant bit of `x`.
- The value of `x` and `bit` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and \(x \neq 1\); `bits` is a list containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the second element is the least significant bit of `x`; `bit` is the least significant bit of `x`, which is either 0 or 1.**
