Initial State: `x` is 0; `bits` is a list containing all the bits of the original value of `x` in reverse order; `n` is the length of the `bits` list.

The code `a = [0] * n` initializes a list `a` with `n` elements, each set to 0. 

- The value of `x` remains unchanged, so `x` is 0.
- The value of `bits` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is 0; `bits` is a list containing all the bits of the original value of `x` in reverse order; `n` is the length of the `bits` list; `a` is a list of `n` elements, each set to 0.**
