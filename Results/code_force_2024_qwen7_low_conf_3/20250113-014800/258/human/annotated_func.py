    return a
    #The program returns a list 'a' of length 'n', where each element a[i] is 1 if bits[i] is True, and a[i+1] is -1 if bits[i+1] is True, given that 'bits' is a list containing all the bits of the original value of x (which is 0) in reverse order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). It returns either a list containing only the element `[1]` if `x` is 1, or a list `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is 1 if the `i-th` bit from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) of `x` is True, and `a[i+1]` is -1 if the `(i+1)-th` bit is True. The list `a` is derived from the reversed bit representation of `x`.

The function processes the integer `x` by first checking if it is 1. If so, it returns `[1]`. Otherwise, it extracts the bits of `x` into a list `bits`, reverses them, and then constructs the list `a` based on these bits. Specifically, for each bit in `bits`, if the current bit is 1, the corresponding element in `a` is set to 1; if the next bit is 1, the next element in `a` is set to -1. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the constructed list `a`, which represents the bit pattern of `x` in a specific manner as described.
