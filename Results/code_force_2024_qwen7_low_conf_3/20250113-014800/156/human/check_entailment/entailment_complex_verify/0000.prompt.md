You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calculates and prints the minimum total cost for purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days. The cost per ticket can vary daily according to the list `a`. If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, it simply prints the product of the minimum ticket price and `k`. Otherwise, it handles two cases: when `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and when it is not. In the first case, it selects the smallest `k // m` prices from `a`, and in the second case, it includes one additional smallest price if needed. It then calculates the total cost based on these selected prices and prints the result. The function supports up to 10,000 test cases, with constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k` ensuring efficient processing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be purchased exceeds the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`nm`). This is a critical edge case that needs to be handled according to the problem description.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
1
5 1 10
1 1 1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, `k` (10) exceeds `n*m` (5*1=5), which means it's impossible to purchase 10 tickets under the given constraints. The program should handle this case and output an appropriate message or value indicating that it's impossible to purchase the required number of tickets.

However, the current implementation does not check if `k > nm` before proceeding with the calculations. Instead, it proceeds with the calculation assuming that `k` can always be purchased within the given constraints. This leads to incorrect results for such cases.

To fix this, an additional check should be added at the beginning of the function to handle cases where `k > nm`. If `k > nm`, the function should output an indication that it's impossible to purchase the required number of tickets.
