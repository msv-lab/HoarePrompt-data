Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be purchased exceeds the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`nm`). This is a critical edge case that needs to be handled according to the problem description.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
1
5 1 10
1 1 1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, `k` (10) exceeds `n*m` (5*1=5), which means it's impossible to purchase 10 tickets under the given constraints. The program should handle this case and output an appropriate message or value indicating that it's impossible to purchase the required number of tickets.

However, the current implementation does not check if `k > nm` before proceeding with the calculations. Instead, it proceeds with the calculation assuming that `k` can always be purchased within the given constraints. This leads to incorrect results for such cases.

To fix this, an additional check should be added at the beginning of the function to handle cases where `k > nm`. If `k > nm`, the function should output an indication that it's impossible to purchase the required number of tickets.
