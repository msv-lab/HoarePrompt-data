Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Minimum Spending Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to minimize the total spending on tickets, but it does not correctly calculate the total cost based on the given rules. Specifically, the logic for adjusting prices after purchasing tickets on a certain day is not accurately implemented.
   - The program incorrectly handles the scenario where the number of tickets purchased exceeds the maximum limit (`m`) in a single day. It does not properly account for the price increase on subsequent days as described in the problem.

2. **Incorrect Set and Sorting Logic**:
   - The program uses sets and sorting to select the cheapest tickets, but this approach does not fully address the requirement to minimize the total spending. The use of sets and sorting can lead to suboptimal solutions because it does not consider the price increases correctly.

3. **Inadequate Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not adequately handle edge cases, such as when the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is larger than the product of `n` and `m`. The program should handle this by considering all possible ways to distribute the ticket purchases across the days while respecting the constraints.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example where the problem description and the expected behavior should be clear:

### Example Input:
```
2
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```

### Expected Output:
```
10
1
```

### Actual Output:
The provided program does not produce the expected output. For instance, for the first test case, the correct minimum spending to buy 3 tickets would involve buying 1 ticket on the third day and 2 tickets on the fourth day, which sums up to 4 + 6 = 10. Similarly, for the second test case, the correct minimum spending is 1 (buying 1 ticket on the first day).

### Why the Program Fails:
- The program incorrectly calculates the total spending without fully accounting for the price increases after each purchase.
- It does not consider all possible ways to distribute the ticket purchases across the days to minimize the total cost.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement and thus fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
