### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` for each.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `a` for each test case.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - When `k <= m`, the program finds the minimum price in `a` and multiplies it by `k`.
   - This is correct because the minimum price can be chosen without increasing future prices.

3. **Handling Larger `k`:**
   - For larger values of `k`, the program sorts `a` and selects the first `k // m` or `k // m + 1` elements (whichever is required).
   - It then calculates the total cost by iterating through these selected prices, applying the price increases for each day.
   - However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
     - **Incorrect Calculation of Total Cost:**
       - The program calculates the total cost by multiplying each selected price by `m` and adding the cumulative increment `c` to each price before multiplying.
       - This approach is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the incremental price increases after each purchase.
       - Specifically, the formula `(b[i] + c) * m` does not correctly reflect the increasing prices as described in the problem statement.
     - **Handling of Incremental Increases:**
       - The program should keep track of the cumulative increment `c` and apply it correctly to each day's price.
       - The current implementation incorrectly adds the cumulative increment `c` to the selected prices, leading to incorrect total costs.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and when it is not.
   - However, the handling of the edge case is still flawed due to the incorrect calculation of the total cost.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the calculated minimum cost for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirement.
   - However, due to the flaws in the cost calculation, the output will be incorrect in many cases.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
