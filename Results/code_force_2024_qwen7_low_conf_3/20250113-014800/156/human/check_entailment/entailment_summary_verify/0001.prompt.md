You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calculates and prints the minimum total cost for purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days. The cost per ticket can vary daily according to the list `a`. If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, it simply prints the product of the minimum ticket price and `k`. Otherwise, it handles two cases: when `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and when it is not. In the first case, it selects the smallest `k // m` prices from `a`, and in the second case, it includes one additional smallest price if needed. It then calculates the total cost based on these selected prices and prints the result. The function supports up to 10,000 test cases, with constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k` ensuring efficient processing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's break down its logic and compare it with the requirements of the problem:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` for each.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `a` for each test case.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - When `k <= m`, the program finds the minimum price in `a` and multiplies it by `k`. This is a straightforward approach and works according to the problem statement where the minimum price can be chosen without increasing future prices.

3. **Handling Larger `k`:**
   - For larger values of `k`, the program sorts `a` and selects the first `k // m` or `k // m + 1` elements (whichever is required).
   - It then calculates the total cost by iterating through these selected prices, applying the price increases for each day.
   - The logic for calculating the cost seems to be correct as it handles both the base prices and the incremental increases due to previous purchases.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and when it is not.
   - It ensures that the total number of tickets purchased matches `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the calculated minimum cost for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirement.

Based on the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.
