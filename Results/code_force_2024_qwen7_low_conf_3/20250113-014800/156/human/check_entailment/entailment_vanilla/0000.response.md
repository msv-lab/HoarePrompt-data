Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's break down its logic and compare it with the requirements of the problem:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` for each.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `a` for each test case.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - When `k <= m`, the program finds the minimum price in `a` and multiplies it by `k`. This is a straightforward approach and works according to the problem statement where the minimum price can be chosen without increasing future prices.

3. **Handling Larger `k`:**
   - For larger values of `k`, the program sorts `a` and selects the first `k // m` or `k // m + 1` elements (whichever is required).
   - It then calculates the total cost by iterating through these selected prices, applying the price increases for each day.
   - The logic for calculating the cost seems to be correct as it handles both the base prices and the incremental increases due to previous purchases.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and when it is not.
   - It ensures that the total number of tickets purchased matches `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the calculated minimum cost for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirement.

Based on the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
