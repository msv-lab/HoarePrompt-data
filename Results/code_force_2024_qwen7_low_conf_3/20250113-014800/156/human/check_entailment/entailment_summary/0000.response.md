Reasoning:
1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly iterates through each test case and processes the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a`.
2. **Simple Case Handling**: When `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the function correctly identifies the minimum price and multiplies it by `k`, which is the right approach.
3. **Complex Case Handling**:
   - For cases where `k` is exactly divisible by `m`, the function correctly identifies the smallest `k // m` prices from the list `a` and calculates the total cost accordingly.
   - For cases where `k` is not exactly divisible by `m`, the function again correctly identifies the smallest `k // m + 1` prices from the list `a` and calculates the total cost considering the extra tickets.
4. **Efficiency**: The function uses sets and sorting efficiently to find the required minimum prices, which fits within the constraints given.

Based on the provided reasoning and the execution summary, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
