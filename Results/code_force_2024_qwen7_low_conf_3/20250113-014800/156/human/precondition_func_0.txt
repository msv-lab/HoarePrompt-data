t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Additionally, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
