`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `m` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `m`. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `b` is [2, 3, 5]; `leng` is 3; `mx` is 5; `mx_ind_lt` is 2; `res` is original value + (5 + c) * m; `c` is `c + m`; `a` is [2, 3, 5]; `s` is {2, 3, 5}**
