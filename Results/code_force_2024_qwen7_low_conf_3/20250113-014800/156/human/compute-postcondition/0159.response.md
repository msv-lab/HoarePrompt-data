Postcondition: ***`i` is either `len(b) - 1` or `2`, `b` is modified according to the conditions specified in the if and else parts, `leng` is `k // m + 1`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are defined only if `k % m != 0`, `res` is calculated based on the modified `b` and the conditions, `c` is `n * m` if `k % m == 0` otherwise `k`, `a` is the list `[n, m, k]`, and `s` is the set containing the first `k // m` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]` if `k % m == 0`.***
