Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `students_list` is a list of students (though not used in the loop)
   - `b` is a list containing exactly `k // m + 1` integers
   - `leng` is `k // m + 1`
   - `k` and `m` are positive integers
   - `c` is 0
   - `res` is 0
   - `mx` is the maximum value in `b`
   - `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`
   - `i` is 0
   - Both `b[i]` and `mx` are equal, and `i` is equal to `mx_ind_lt`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `res += (b[i] + c) * (k % m)` is executed.
   - Since `i` is 0, `b[i]` is `b[0]`.
   - Given that `c` is 0, the equation simplifies to `res += b[0] * (k % m)`.
   - Since `mx` is the maximum value in `b` and `b[0]` is `mx`, the equation further simplifies to `res += mx * (k % m)`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `res` is updated to `res + mx * (k % m)`. Since `res` was initially 0, `res` becomes `mx * (k % m)`.
   - No other variables are affected.

4. **Output State:**
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `students_list` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `leng` remains `k // m + 1`.
   - `k` and `m` remain unchanged.
   - `c` remains 0.
   - `res` is now `mx * (k % m)`.
   - `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`.
   - `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`.
   - `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students (though not used in the loop), `b` is a list containing exactly `k // m + 1` integers, `leng` is `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is 0, `res` is `mx * (k % m)`, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, `i` is 0**
