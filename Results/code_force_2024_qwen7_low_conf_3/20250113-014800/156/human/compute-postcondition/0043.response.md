`b.append(a[i])` appends the value at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Since `a[i]` is an integer (as `a` is a list of integers), `b` is updated with this new integer. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `leng`, `k`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `s` is a set, `leng` is an integer, and `k` and `m` are positive integers such that the current value of `leng` is less than `k // m + 1` and there exists at least one element `x` in `a` such that `x` is in `s`; `b` is a list with one additional integer `a[i]` appended to it.**
