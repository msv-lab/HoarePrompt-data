Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[j]` is `a[i]` if `a[i]` is in `s` and `j` is the index such that `i = i_prev + j * (k_val // m_val)`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is `k_val // m_val` if `b` is filled completely, otherwise it is less than `k_val // m_val`, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + n_val`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `n` iterations.
- During each iteration, if `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m`, the element `a[i]` is appended to `b` and `leng` is incremented.
- After the loop completes, `b` will contain up to `k_val // m_val` elements from the list `a`, which are the elements in `s`.
- The variable `i` will be updated to `i_prev + n_val` after the loop completes.
- The lengths and other unchanged variables (`total`, `t`, `m`, `k`, `n`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `c`, `res`, `a`, `s`) retain their original values unless modified within the loop.
