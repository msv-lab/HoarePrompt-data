`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `c` was initially 0, so now it becomes `0 + m`, which simplifies to `m`. The value of `res` was incremented by `b[i] * m`, but this value remains unchanged. The state of `b` and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`c` is `m`, `res` is incremented by `b[i] * m`, `b` must be a non-empty iterable.**
