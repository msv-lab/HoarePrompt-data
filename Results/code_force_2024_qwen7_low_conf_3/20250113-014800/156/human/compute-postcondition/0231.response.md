Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state**: 
   - `total` is unchanged.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `m` is unchanged.
   - `k` is `k_val`.
   - `n` is `n_val`.
   - `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements.
   - `mx` is the maximum value in `b`.
   - `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged.
   - `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`.
   - `i` is either `i_new + 1` or `i_val + 1`.
   - `res` is updated to `res + (b[i_new] + c) * (k % m)` or `res + (b[i_val] + c) * m` as per the condition inside the if-else block.

2. **Understand the loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(b)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of `len(b)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `i_new + 1` or `i_val + 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Since `i` is either `i_new + 1` or `i_val + 1`, we need to check which value it holds and increment it by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains `k_val`.
   - `n` remains `n_val`.
   - `b` remains the same list of elements.
   - `mx` remains unchanged.
   - `mx_ind_lt` remains unchanged.
   - `leng` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1` (either `i_new + 2` or `i_val + 2`).
   - `res` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it.

Given these points, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `i` is `i + 1` (either `i_new + 2` or `i_val + 2`), and `res` is unchanged.**
