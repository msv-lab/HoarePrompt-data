Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a` and `i + 1 < n`, `s` is a set, `leng` is an integer, `k` and `m` are positive integers, and `b` is a list with the integer `a[i]` appended to it. If `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, then `leng` is incremented by 1 and `b` is updated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
