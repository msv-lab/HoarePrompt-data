The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific integers provided by the user, and the other variables (`total`, `t`, `b`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `leng`, `c`, `res`, `a`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged. Since the input values are not specified, we will represent them as `n_val`, `m_val`, and `k_val`.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev + 1**
