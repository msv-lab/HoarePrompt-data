`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is not yet defined.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), `n` is an input integer, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is not yet defined.**
