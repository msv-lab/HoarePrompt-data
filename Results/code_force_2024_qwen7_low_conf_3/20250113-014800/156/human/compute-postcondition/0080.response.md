Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer satisfying \(k > m\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\); `n` is the last input integer. If `k % m == 0`, then `c` is `n * m`, `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + (j-1)*m) * m` for all `i` in range `len(b)` and `j` ranging from 1 to `n`, `b` is a non-empty iterable where `n` is the number of elements in `b`. Otherwise, `total` is 0, `students_list` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `leng` remains `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` remain unchanged, `c` is `k`, `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + c) * m` for all `i` in `range(leng)` where `b[i] != mx` and `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for the last occurrence of `mx`, `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, and `i` is `leng`.**
