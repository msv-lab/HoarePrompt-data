Postcondition: ***`b` is an empty list, `leng` is less than k // m + 1, `mx` is undefined, `mx_ind_lt` is undefined, `res` is the initial value as defined, `c` is as defined, `a` is `[n, m, k]`, `s` is the set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`, and the current value of `i` is such that `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`***
