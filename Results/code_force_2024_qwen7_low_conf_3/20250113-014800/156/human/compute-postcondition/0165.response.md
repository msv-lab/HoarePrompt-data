The code `print(min(a) * k)` calculates the minimum value in the list `a` and multiplies it by `k`. The result of this calculation is printed. However, since the exact values of `a`, `min(a)`, and `k` are not specified, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

The other variables remain unchanged. So, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and the new output due to the print statement.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, the output is `min(a) * k_val`**
