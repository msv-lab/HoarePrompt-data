`b` is appended with the value `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is one of the elements from the set `s` because the condition states that `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is an empty list with the added element `a[i]`, `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`, `mx` is undefined, `mx_ind_lt` is undefined, `res` is the initial value as defined, `c` is as defined, `a` is `[n, m, k]`, `s` is the set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`, and the current value of `i` is such that `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`**.
