The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of these variables are now concrete and dependent on the user's input.

- The initial value of `t` remains unchanged because it was not involved in the operation.
- The initial value of `m` and `k` is now specifically determined by the user's input.
- The initial value of `n` is also now specifically determined by the user's input, but note that it must still satisfy \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\); `n` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and `n` is the input integer.**
