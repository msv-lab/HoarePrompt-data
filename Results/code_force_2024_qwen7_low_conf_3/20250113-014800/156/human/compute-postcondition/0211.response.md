Postcondition: ***`m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is `[a[i_prev + 3]]` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng` was `previous_leng + 1`, otherwise `b` remains `[]`; `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is either `previous_leng + 2` if it was `previous_leng + 1` or `previous_leng + 1` if it was `previous_leng`, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 3`***

Explanation:
- If `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, then `b` is updated to `[a[i_prev + 3]]` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng` was `previous_leng + 1`, otherwise it remains `[]`. Also, `leng` becomes `previous_leng + 1`.
- Since there is no else part, if the condition `a[i] in s and leng < k // m + 1` is not met, `b` remains unchanged as `[]` and `leng` remains unchanged as well.

Therefore, the overall postcondition combines both scenarios while ensuring that the conditions from the precondition are preserved.
