`a` is assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input consists of four integers: `t`, `m`, `k`, and `n` in this order. The variables `t`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, while `n` is updated to the last input value. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\); `n` is the last input integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\); `n` is the last input integer.**
