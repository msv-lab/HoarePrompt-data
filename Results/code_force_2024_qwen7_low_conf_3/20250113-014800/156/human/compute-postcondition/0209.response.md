The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Given that `i` is `i_prev + 3`, the value of `i` is updated, and list `b` is modified by adding the element at this new index.

From the initial state:
- `m` is `m_val`
- `k` is `k_val`
- `n` is `n_val`
- `b` is `[a[i_prev + 3]]` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng` was `previous_leng + 1`, otherwise `b` remains `[]`
- `mx` is unchanged
- `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged
- `leng` is either `previous_leng + 2` if it was `previous_leng + 1` or `previous_leng + 1` if it was `previous_leng`
- `c` is unchanged
- `res` is unchanged
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input
- `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`
- `i` is `i_prev + 3`

After appending `a[i]` to `b`:
- The value of `i` remains `i_prev + 3`
- The value of `b` changes to `[a[i_prev + 3]]` appended with `a[i_prev + 3]`, i.e., `[a[i_prev + 3], a[i_prev + 3]]` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng` was `previous_leng + 1`; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is `[a[i_prev + 3], a[i_prev + 3]]` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng` was `previous_leng + 1`, otherwise `b` remains `[a[i_prev + 3]`; `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is either `previous_leng + 2` if it was `previous_leng + 1` or `previous_leng + 1` if it was `previous_leng`, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 3`**
