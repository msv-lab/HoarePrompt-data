Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a` such that `i` is `j+1` where `j` is the index at the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a set, `b` is a list that may have an additional element if `a[j+1]` is in `s`, `leng` is \((k // m) + 1\). If `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than \(k // m\), then `leng` is updated to \((k // m) + 2\). Otherwise, the value of `leng` remains unchanged.***
