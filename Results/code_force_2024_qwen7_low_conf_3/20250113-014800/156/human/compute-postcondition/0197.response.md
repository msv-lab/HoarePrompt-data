The code initializes an empty list `b`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is an empty list `[]`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `k % m != 0**
