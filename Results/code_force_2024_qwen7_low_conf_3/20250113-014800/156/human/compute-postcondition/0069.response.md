`c` is initially assigned the value `k % m`. The code `c += k % m` adds `k % m` to the current value of `c`. Since `c` was already set to `k % m`, adding `k % m` to `c` doubles its value. Therefore, the new value of `c` is `2 * (k % m)`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `leng` remains `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` remain unchanged, `c` is `2 * (k % m)`, `res` is `res + (b[1] + k % m) * (k % m)`, `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, and `i` is 2**
