The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the value at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is defined as `j + 2`. Therefore, `b` gains a new element, which is `a[j + 2]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is \(j + 2\), `s` is a set, `b` is a list that now includes an additional element `a[j + 2]`, `leng` is \((k // m) + 1\) unless `a[j + 2]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than \((k // m)\), in which case `leng` is \((k // m) + 2\).

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is \(j + 2\), `s` is a set, `b` is a list including `a[j + 2]`, `leng` is \((k // m) + 1\) unless `a[j + 2]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than \((k // m)\), in which case `leng` is \((k // m) + 2\).**
