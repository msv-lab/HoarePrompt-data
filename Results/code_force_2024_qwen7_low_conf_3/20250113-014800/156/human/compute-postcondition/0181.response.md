Postcondition: ***`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is either `[a[i_prev], a[i_prev + 1], a[i_prev + 3], a[i]]` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m` or `[a[i]]` if `b` was initially empty or `a[i_prev + 3]` is not in `s` or `leng` is not less than `k // m`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is `3` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m`, or `2` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is not in `s` or `leng` is not less than `k // m`, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 3`***
