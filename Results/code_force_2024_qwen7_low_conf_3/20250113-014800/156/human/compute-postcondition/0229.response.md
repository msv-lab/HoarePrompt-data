`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `c` becomes `c + m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `res` is updated to `res + (b[i_val] + c) * m`, `c` is `c + m`.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `res` is updated to `res + (b[i_val] + c) * m`, `c` is `c + m`.**
