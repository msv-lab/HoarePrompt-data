The code snippet appends `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. Since `b` initially contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` is in `s`, appending `a[1]` again will not change the existing element in `b` because it already exists. However, the value of `i` is incremented by 1 due to the nature of list indexing in Python when iterating. 

Since `i` was initially 1, after the operation `i` will become 2. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a list containing `a[1]` if `a[1]` is in `s`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are undefined, and `leng` is 1.**
