The value of `c` is incremented by `m`. Given that `c` was initially equal to `m`, the new value of `c` is `m + m`, which simplifies to `2 * m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n`; `b` must contain at least `n` elements; `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are undefined; `leng` is `k // m`; `c` is `2 * m`; `res` is `b[n-1] * m + (b[n] + m) * m`; `a` is the list `[n, m, k]`; `s` is the set containing the first `k // m` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`.**
