The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. The value of `leng` was previously less than `k // m + 1`, so after incrementing, `leng` will be equal to the previous value of `leng` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is `[a[i]]`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is `previous_leng + 1`, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `i_prev + 1` is less than `n_val`, and `a[i]` is in `s`**
