Postcondition: ***`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is either unchanged or a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` with `leng` being the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `c` is the final value of `c` after all iterations, `res` is the final value of `res` after all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, and `i` is the final value of `i` after all iterations. If `k % m == 0`, then `res` is `res_initial + sum((b[i] + c_initial + im) * m for i in range(len(b)))` and `c` is `c_initial + len(b) * m`. Otherwise, `res` is the final value of `res` after all iterations and `c` is the final value of `c` after all iterations.***
