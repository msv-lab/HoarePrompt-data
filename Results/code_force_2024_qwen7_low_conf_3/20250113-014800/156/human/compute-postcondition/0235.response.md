The code snippet `c += m` increments the value of `c` by `m`. Since `c` was previously unchanged and `m` is unchanged, the new value of `c` is the original value of `c` plus `m`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `i` is `i + 1` (either `i_new + 2` or `i_val + 2`), `res` is `res_prev + (b[i] + c) * m`, and `c` is `c + m`.**
