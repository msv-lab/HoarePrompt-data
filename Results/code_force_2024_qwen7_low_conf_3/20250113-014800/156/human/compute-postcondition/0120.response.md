Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\)
- `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\)
- `n` is the second input integer
- `b` is an empty list
- `mx` is the maximum value in `b`
- `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`
- `leng` is 0
- `c` is `n * m` if `k % m == 0` otherwise `k`
- `res` is the initial value calculated as specified
- `a` is the list of integers `[n, m, k]`
- `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`

### Loop Execution Conditions
The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute for each value of `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

### Adjustments Needed
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to check the conditions that must be met before the loop starts:

1. **List `b`:**
   - Since `b` is initially empty, no elements are present in `b` at the start of the loop.
   - The loop body will operate on `b`, but since `b` is empty, no elements will be modified during the loop execution.

2. **Variable `leng`:**
   - `leng` is initialized to 0, indicating the length of `b`.
   - The loop will update `leng` as it processes elements in `b`.

3. **Variables `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, and `res`:**
   - These variables are dependent on the elements in `b`.
   - Since `b` is initially empty, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are irrelevant because there are no elements to compare.
   - `res` is calculated based on the current state of `b`, which is empty.

4. **Variable `c`:**
   - `c` is determined by the value of `k` and `m`.
   - `c` does not change within the loop, so it remains as defined.

5. **List `a` and Set `s`:**
   - These are defined based on `n`, `m`, and `k` and do not change within the loop.

### Conclusion
Given that `b` is initially empty, the loop will only process an empty list. Therefore, the critical state that needs adjustment is ensuring that the loop has something to process.

### Final Answer
State: **`b` is an empty list, `leng` is 0, `mx` is undefined, `mx_ind_lt` is undefined, `res` is the initial value as defined, `c` is as defined, `a` is `[n, m, k]`, `s` is the set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`**

This ensures that the loop can start processing, even though `b` is initially empty, and the loop will eventually modify its contents.
