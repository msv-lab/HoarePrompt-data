To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to consider how the loop variable `i` changes and how other relevant variables might be affected.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `i+1`
- `b` either includes the new element `a[i]` or remains unchanged
- `leng` is either `i+2` or unchanged
- `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined
- `res` remains the initial value
- `c` remains as defined
- `a` remains unchanged

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, if the current `i` value is `k`, the next iteration will start with `i = k + 1`.

2. **Adjusting `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `b`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `res`, `c`, and `a` are specified to remain unchanged or remain as defined. Therefore, these variables do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1` (as it will be incremented to the next value)
- `b`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `res`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` either includes the new element `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `leng` is either `i + 2` or unchanged, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined, `res` remains the initial value, `c` remains as defined, and `a` remains unchanged.**
