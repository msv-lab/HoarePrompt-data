The code snippet updates the variable `res` by adding `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `total` is 0
- `students_list` remains unchanged
- `b` remains unchanged
- `leng` remains `k // m + 1`
- `k` and `m` remain unchanged
- `c` is either `k % m` or `m`
- `res` is either `mx * (k % m)` or `b[1] * m`
- `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`
- `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`
- `i` is 1

The value of `b[i]` is `b[1]` because `i` is 1. Thus, the new value of `res` is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{res} \rightarrow (\text{res} + (b[1] + c) \times m)
\]

Since `res` is initially either `mx * (k % m)` or `b[1] * m`, let's denote it as `res_initial`. Therefore, the updated value of `res` will be:

\[
\text{res} = \text{res\_initial} + (b[1] + c) \times m
\]

So, the updated state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `leng` remains `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` remain unchanged, `c` is either `k % m` or `m`, `res` is `res_initial + (b[1] + c) * m`, `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, and `i` is 2**
