To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs over the range of `len(b)`, meaning `i` will iterate from 0 to `len(b) - 1`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `total` is unchanged.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `m` is `m_val`.
   - `k` is `k_val`.
   - `n` is `n_val`.
   - `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements.
   - `mx` is the maximum value in `b`.
   - `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged.
   - `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`.
   - `i` is `n_val`.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < len(b)`.

Given this, we need to ensure that `i` (which starts at `n_val`) is less than `len(b)` for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n_val` should be less than `len(b)`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `total` is unchanged.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `m` is `m_val`.
- `k` is `k_val`.
- `n` is `n_val`.
- `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements.
- `mx` is the maximum value in `b`.
- `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged.
- `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`.
- `c` is 0.
- `res` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`.
- `i` is `n_val` and `n_val` must be less than `len(b)`.

**Final State**:
State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `c` is 0, `res` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `n_val` and `n_val` must be less than `len(b)`**
