`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `m` is `m_val`, so `c` is now `c + m_val`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `c` is `c + m_val`, `res` is `b[i] * m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `n_val`, and `b[i] != mx` or `i != mx_ind_lt` or both.**
