`b` is appended with `a[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, but the exact value of `i` is not specified. The value of `a[i]` is added to `b`, and the length of `b` increases by 1. The other variables (`leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `res`, `c`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` includes the new element `a[i]`, `leng` is either `i + 2` or unchanged, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined, `res` remains the initial value, `c` remains as defined, and `a` remains unchanged.**
