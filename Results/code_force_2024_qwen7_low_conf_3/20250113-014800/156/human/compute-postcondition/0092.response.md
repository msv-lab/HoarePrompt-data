`b` is appended with the value of `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is in `s`, it means `a[i]` is added to the list `b`. The length of `b` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `b` is `[a[i]]`, `mx` is undefined, `mx_ind_lt` is undefined, `leng` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `b` is `[a[i]]`, `mx` is undefined, `mx_ind_lt` is undefined, `leng` is 0**
