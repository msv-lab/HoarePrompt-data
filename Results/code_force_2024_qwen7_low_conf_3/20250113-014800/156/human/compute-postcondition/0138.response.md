According to the given for loop:
```python
for i in range(len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
We need to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `b` remains `[2, 3, 5]`, so `len(b)` is 3.
   - `leng` remains `3`.
   - `mx` remains `5`.
   - `mx_ind_lt` is now `2`.
   - `res` remains `0`.
   - `c` remains `0`.
   - `a` remains `[2, 3, 5]`.
   - `s` remains `{2, 3, 5}`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < 3`.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute if `i` is within the range `[0, 2]`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `0` at the start of the loop.
   - `len(b)` should remain `3` since `b` does not change during the loop.

### Conclusion:

The state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`, which should be set to `0` at the start of the loop. All other variables (`b`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `res`, `c`, `a`, `s`) are either already correctly set or will not affect the loop's ability to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `b` is [2, 3, 5], `leng` is 3, `mx` is 5, `mx_ind_lt` is 2, `res` is 0, `c` is 0, `a` is [2, 3, 5], `s` is {2, 3, 5}**
