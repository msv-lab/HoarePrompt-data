The line of code `leng = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leng`. This updates the value of `leng` without affecting the other variables. The initial value of `leng` was `k // m + 1`, which is now replaced by 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\); `n` is the second input integer; `b` is an empty list; `mx` is the maximum value in `b`; `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`; `leng` is 0; `c` is `n * m` if `k % m == 0` otherwise `k`; `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + (j-1)*m) * m` for all `i` in `range(len(b))` and `j` ranging from 1 to `n` if `k % m == 0` otherwise the sum of `(b[i] + c) * m` for all `i` in `range(leng)` where `b[i] != mx` and `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for the last occurrence of `mx`, and `i` is `i + 1`; `a` is the list of integers `[n, m, k]`; `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`.**
