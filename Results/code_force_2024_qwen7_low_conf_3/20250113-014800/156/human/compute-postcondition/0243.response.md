Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calculates and prints the minimum total cost for purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days. The cost per ticket can vary daily according to the list `a`. If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, it simply prints the product of the minimum ticket price and `k`. Otherwise, it handles two cases: when `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and when it is not. In the first case, it selects the smallest `k // m` prices from `a`, and in the second case, it includes one additional smallest price if needed. It then calculates the total cost based on these selected prices and prints the result. The function supports up to 10,000 test cases, with constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k` ensuring efficient processing.**

This summary covers all the functionalities and edge cases present in the code, including handling both scenarios when `k` is divisible by `m` and when it is not, as well as the base case where `k` is less than or equal to `m`.
