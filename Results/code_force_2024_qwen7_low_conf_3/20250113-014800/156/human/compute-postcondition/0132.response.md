Postcondition: ***`i` is `i + 1`, `b` either includes the new element `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `leng` is either `i + 3` or unchanged, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined, `res` remains the initial value, `c` remains as defined, and `a` remains unchanged. This is true if `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // (m + 1)`. Otherwise, the state remains as described in the precondition.***
