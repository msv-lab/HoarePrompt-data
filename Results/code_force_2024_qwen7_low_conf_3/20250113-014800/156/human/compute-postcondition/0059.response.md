To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the information given and analyze what the loop requires.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted version of `a`.
- `b` is a list containing all integers from `a` that are in `s` and the number of such integers is exactly `k // m + 1`.
- `leng` is `k // m + 1`.
- `k` and `m` are positive integers.
- `c` is 0.
- `res` is 0.
- `mx` is the maximum value in `b`.
- `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`.

### Analysis of the Loop:
The loop iterates over the list `b` using `i` as the index variable. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the bounds of the list `b`.

### Necessary States to Adjust:
1. **List `b` should not be empty**: The loop needs to have at least one element to iterate over.
2. **Variable `i` should start at 0**: The loop starts at `i = 0` and increments `i` until `i < len(b)`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `b` contains exactly `k // m + 1` elements, and we know `leng` is also `k // m + 1`, the list `b` is guaranteed to be non-empty and contain the required number of elements. Thus, no additional adjustment to `b` is needed.

However, since the loop starts at `i = 0`, this state needs to be explicitly mentioned to ensure the loop body is entered at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students (though not used in the loop), `b` is a list containing exactly `k // m + 1` integers, `leng` is `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is 0, `res` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, `i` is 0**
