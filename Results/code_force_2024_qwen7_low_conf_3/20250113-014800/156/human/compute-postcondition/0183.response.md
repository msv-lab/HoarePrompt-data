The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[j]` is `a[i]` if `a[i]` is in `s` and `j` is the index such that `i = i_prev + j * (k_val // m_val)`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is `k_val // m_val` if `b` is filled completely, otherwise it is less than `k_val // m_val`, `c` is `0`, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + n_val`.**
