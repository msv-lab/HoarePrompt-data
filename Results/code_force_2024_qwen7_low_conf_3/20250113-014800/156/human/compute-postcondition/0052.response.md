`leng` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `leng` is the original value of `leng` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a` and `i + 2 < n`, `s` is a set, `leng` is the original value of `leng` + 1, `k` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list with the integer `a[i]` appended to it.**
