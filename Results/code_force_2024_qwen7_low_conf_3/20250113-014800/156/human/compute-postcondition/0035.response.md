`c` is initially `2m`. The value of `c` is incremented by `m`, making `c` equal to `3m`. The value of `b` and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state because the code only affects `c`.

Output State: **`c` is `3m`, `res` is incremented by `(b[1] + m) * m + (b[i] + c) * m`, `b` must be a non-empty iterable.**
