`c` is incremented by `m`. The previous value of `c` was `c + 2m`, so the new value of `c` is `(c + 2m) + m = c + 3m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res` is `res_initial + 2 * b[i_prev + n_val + 2] * m + 3 * c * m + b[i] * m`, `c` is `c + 3m`, `b` must still have at least one element, `a` must still have enough elements in the first `k_val // m_val` positions to construct `b`, `i` is `i_prev + n_val + 2`**
