`c` is incremented by `m`. Given the initial state, `c` was initially `0`, so now `c` becomes `0 + m`, which simplifies to `m`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `b` must contain at least 1 element, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are undefined, `leng` is `k // m`, `c` is `m`, `res` is `b[n-1] * m`, `a` is the list `[n, m, k]`, `s` is the set containing the first `k // m` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`.**
