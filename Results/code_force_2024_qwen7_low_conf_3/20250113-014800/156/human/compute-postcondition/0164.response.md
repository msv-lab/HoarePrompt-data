The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list `a`. However, since no specific input is given, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `a`. We only know that `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev + 1**
