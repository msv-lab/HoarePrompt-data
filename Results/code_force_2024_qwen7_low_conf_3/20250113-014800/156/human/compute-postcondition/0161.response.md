Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\); `n` is the second input integer; `b` is a non-empty iterable where `n` is the number of elements in `b`; `mx` is the maximum value in `b`; `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`; `leng` is `k // m + 1`; `c` is `n * m` if `k % m == 0` otherwise `k`; `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + (j-1)*m) * m` for all `i` in `range(len(b))` and `j` ranging from 1 to `n` if `k % m == 0` otherwise the sum of `(b[i] + c) * m` for all `i` in `range(leng)` where `b[i] != mx` and `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for the last occurrence of `mx`, and `i` is `i + 1`; `a` is the list of integers `[n, m, k]`; if `k <= m`, the output is the minimum of `n`, `m`, and `k` multiplied by `k`. Otherwise, `i` is either `len(b) - 1` or `2`, `b` is modified according to the conditions specified in the if and else parts, `leng` is `k // m + 1`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are defined only if `k % m != 0`, `res` is the same as before, `c` is `n * m` if `k % m == 0` otherwise `k`, `a` is the list `[n, m, k]`, and `s` is the set containing the first `k // m` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]` if `k % m == 0`.**
