The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. Since `leng` was initially either `i + 2` or unchanged (implying it could be a different value if it was previously set), after executing the code, `leng` will now be one more than its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `b`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `res`, `c`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` includes the new element `a[i]`, `leng` is `i + 3` or unchanged, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined, `res` remains the initial value, `c` remains as defined, and `a` remains unchanged.**
