Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students_list` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `leng` remains `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` remain unchanged, `c` is either `2 * (k % m)` or `m`, `res` is updated to either `res + (b[1] + (k % m)) * (k % m)` or `res_initial + (b[1] + c) * m`, `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, and `i` is 2.**
