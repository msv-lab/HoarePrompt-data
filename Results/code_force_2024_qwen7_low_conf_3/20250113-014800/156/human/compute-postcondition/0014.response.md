The value of `leng` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `leng` is `k // m`. Since `leng` is incremented by 1, the new value of `leng` is `(k // m) + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `s` is a set, `leng` is `(k // m) + 1`, `k` and `m` are integers with `leng` being less than `k // m`, an element in `a` at index `i` is also in set `s`, and `b` is a list with one additional element which is `a[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `s` is a set, `leng` is `(k // m) + 1`, `k` and `m` are integers with `leng` being less than `k // m`, an element in `a` at index `i` is also in set `s`, and `b` is a list with one additional element which is `a[i]`**.
