Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\)
   - `k` is an integer satisfying \(k > m\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\)
   - `n` is the last input integer
   - `b` is a non-empty iterable where `n` is the number of elements in `b`
   - `mx` is the maximum value in `b`
   - `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`
   - `leng` is defined as `k // m + 1`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `if k % m == 0:`
     - `c` is set to `n * m`
     - `res` is set to the sum of `(b[i] + (j-1)*m) * m` for all `i` in `range(len(b))` and `j` ranging from 1 to `n`
   - `else:`
     - `total` is set to 0
     - `students_list` remains unchanged
     - `b` remains unchanged
     - `leng` remains `k // m + 1`
     - `k` and `m` remain unchanged
     - `c` is set to `k`
     - `res` is set to the sum of `(b[i] + c) * m` for all `i` in `range(leng)` where `b[i] != mx` and `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for the last occurrence of `mx`

3. **Output:**
   - The code prints `res`.

Given this breakdown, let's update the variables and their states:

- If `k % m == 0`:
  - `c` is set to `n * m`
  - `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + (j-1)*m) * m` for all `i` in `range(len(b))` and `j` ranging from 1 to `n`

- If `k % m != 0`:
  - `total` is set to 0
  - `students_list` remains unchanged
  - `b` remains unchanged
  - `leng` remains `k // m + 1`
  - `k` and `m` remain unchanged
  - `c` is set to `k`
  - `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + c) * m` for all `i` in `range(leng)` where `b[i] != mx` and `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for the last occurrence of `mx`

Since the final value of `res` is printed, we focus on the final state of the relevant variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer satisfying \(k > m\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\); `n` is the last input integer; `b` is a non-empty iterable where `n` is the number of elements in `b`; `mx` is the maximum value in `b`; `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`; `leng` is `k // m + 1`; `c` is `n * m` if `k % m == 0` otherwise `k`; `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + (j-1)*m) * m` for all `i` in `range(len(b))` and `j` ranging from 1 to `n` if `k % m == 0` otherwise the sum of `(b[i] + c) * m` for all `i` in `range(leng)` where `b[i] != mx` and `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for the last occurrence of `mx`; the code prints `res`.**
