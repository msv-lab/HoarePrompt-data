Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is \(j + 2\), `s` is a set, and `b` is a list. If `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than \(k // m\), then `b` includes `a[j + 2]` and `leng` is \((k // m) + 2\) or \((k // m) + 3\). Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged and `leng` is \((k // m) + 1\).***
