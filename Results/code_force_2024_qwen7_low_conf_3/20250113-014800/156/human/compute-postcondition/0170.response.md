Postcondition: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is an empty list, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, the length of `leng` is 0, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`. The current value of `a[i]` is in `s` and the length of `leng` is less than `k // m`.**
