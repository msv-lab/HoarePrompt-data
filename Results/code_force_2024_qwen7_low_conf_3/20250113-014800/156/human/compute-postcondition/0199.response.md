Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Range**:
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

2. **Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - `total` is unchanged.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `m` is `m_val`.
   - `k` is `k_val`.
   - `n` is `n_val`.
   - `b` is an empty list `[]`.
   - `mx` is unchanged.
   - `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged.
   - `leng` is 0.
   - `c` is unchanged.
   - `res` is unchanged.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `k % m != 0`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `0 <= i < n` must be true.
   - Since `i` starts from `i_prev + 1`, we need to ensure that `i_prev + 1` is within the range `[0, n_val)`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i_prev + 1` is less than `n_val`. This means `i` should start from `i_prev + 1` and this value should be within the valid range of the loop.
   - The other variables and their values do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to `i_prev + 1`.
- Ensure that `i_prev + 1` is less than `n_val`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is an empty list `[]`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is 0, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `i_prev + 1` must be less than `n_val**.
