According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

Since the loop is iterating over the list `b`, the value of `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `b`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, it means the list `b` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

The other states remain unchanged according to the problem statement.

State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `leng` remains `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` remain unchanged, `c` is either `2 * (k % m)` or `m`, `res` is updated to either `res + (b[1] + (k % m)) * (k % m)` or `res_initial + (b[1] + c) * m`, `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, and `i` is 3**
