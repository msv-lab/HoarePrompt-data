The code `c += m` increments the value of `c` by the value of `m`. Since `c` was previously either `2 * (k % m)` or `m`, adding `m` to `c` results in `c` being updated to `2 * (k % m) + m` or simply `2 * (k % m) + m`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `leng` remains `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` remain unchanged, `c` is now `2 * (k % m) + m`, `res` remains unchanged, `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, and `i` is 3.**
