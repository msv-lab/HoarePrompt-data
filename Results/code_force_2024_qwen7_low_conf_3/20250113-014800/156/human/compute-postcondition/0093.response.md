The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. Since `leng` was initially 0, after this operation, `leng` will be 1. The values of other variables (`i`, `b`, `mx`, and `mx_ind_lt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `b` is `[a[i]]`, `mx` is undefined, `mx_ind_lt` is undefined, `leng` is 1**
