The code `c += k % m` updates the value of `c` by adding the value of `k % m` to the current value of `c`. Since the initial state of `c` is `res + (b[i_new] + c) * (k % m)`, after executing this line, the new value of `c` will be:

\[ \text{new\_c} = \text{res} + (\text{b}[i_{\text{new}}] + \text{c}) \times (\text{k} \% \text{m}) + \text{k} \% \text{m} \]

Since the other variables (`total`, `t`, `m`, `k`, `n`, `b`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `res`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is unchanged, `leng` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `res` is `res + (b[i_new] + c) * (k % m)`, `i` is `i_new`, `c` is `res + (b[i_new] + c) * (k % m) + k % m`**
