The code snippet `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial conditions, we know that `a[i]` is in `s`, which is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`.

Since `i` is `i_prev + 1` and `i_prev + 1` is less than `n_val`, and `a[i]` is in `s`, appending `a[i]` to `b` means that `b` now contains the element `a[i]` at its last position.

Therefore, the updated state includes the following changes:
- `b` is now a list containing the additional element `a[i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is `[a[i]]`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `i_prev + 1` is less than `n_val`, and `a[i]` is in `s`**.
