Postcondition: ***`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`. If `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt`, then `c` is `k % m` and `res` is the original value of `res` plus `mx * (k % m)`. Otherwise, `c` is `c + m_val` and `res` is `b[i] * m`.***
