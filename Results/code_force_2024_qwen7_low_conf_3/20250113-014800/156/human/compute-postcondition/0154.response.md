`c` is incremented by `k % m`. The value of `k % m` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `k % m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `b` is [2, 3, 5]; `leng` is 3; `mx` is 5; `mx_ind_lt` is 2; `res` is `res` + (b[2] + c); `c` is `c + (k % m)'; `a` is [2, 3, 5]; `s` is {2, 3, 5}.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `b` is [2, 3, 5]; `leng` is 3; `mx` is 5; `mx_ind_lt` is 2; `res` is `res` + (b[2] + c); `c` is `c + (k % m)'; `a` is [2, 3, 5]; `s` is {2, 3, 5}.**
