The value of `c` is incremented by `m`. The previous value of `c` was `m`, so now `c` is equal to `m + m`, which simplifies to `2m`. The value of `res` is not affected by this line of code, and `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is `2m`, `res` is incremented by `(b[i] + m) * m`, `b` must be a non-empty iterable.**
