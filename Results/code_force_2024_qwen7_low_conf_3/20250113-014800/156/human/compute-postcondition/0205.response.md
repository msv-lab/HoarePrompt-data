The code appends the element `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i_prev + 2` and must be less than `n_val`. After appending `a[i]` to `b`, the list `b` now contains the element `a[i]`.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is `[a[i_prev + 2]]`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is either `previous_leng + 1` or remains `previous_leng`, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**
