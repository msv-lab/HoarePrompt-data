Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `b` is [2, 3, 5], `leng` is 3, `mx` is 5, `mx_ind_lt` is 2, `res` is either 0 + 2 * (k % m) if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is true, or `res` remains 0, `c` is either `c` + (`k` % `m`) if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is true, or `c` is `c + m`, `a` is [2, 3, 5], `s` is {2, 3, 5}.***
