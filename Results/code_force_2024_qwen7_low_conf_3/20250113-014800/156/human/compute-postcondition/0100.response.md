The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `a[i]` will be either `a[2]` or `a[3]`. Given the initial state, `b` contains an element if `a[1]` is in `s`, and `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are undefined. Also, `leng` is defined based on whether `a[2]` (or `a[3]`) is in `s` and the condition involving `k` and `m`.

Since `i` can be either 2 or 3, let's consider both cases:

1. If `i` is 2, then `b` will append `a[2]`.
2. If `i` is 3, then `b` will append `a[3]`.

In both cases, the values of `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, and `leng` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `b` is a list containing the element from `a` at index `i`; `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are undefined; `leng` is 2 if `a[2]` (or `a[3]`) is in `s` and `leng < k // m`, otherwise `leng` remains 1.**
