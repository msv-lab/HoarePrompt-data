Postcondition: ***`total`, `t`, `m`, `k`, `n`, `b`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `leng`, `c`, `res`, `a`, `s`, and `i` are as follows: 
- If `k <= m_val`, the output is `min(a) * k_val`.
- If `k > m_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` with `leng` being the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `c` is the final value of `c` after all iterations, `res` is the final value of `res` after all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, and `i` is the final value of `i` after all iterations.***
