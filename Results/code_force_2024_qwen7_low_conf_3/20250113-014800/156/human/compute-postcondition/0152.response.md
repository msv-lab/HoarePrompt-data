Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` is `[2, 3, 5]`
   - `leng` is 3
   - `mx` is 5
   - `mx_ind_lt` is 2
   - If `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is true, then `res` is 0 and `c` is `c + k % m`; otherwise, `res` is `res + (3 + (c + m)) * m` and `c` is increased by `m`.
   - `a` is `[2, 3, 5]`
   - `s` is `{2, 3, 5}`

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `b` using `range(len(b))`.
   - In this case, `len(b)` is 3, so the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 2`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - Since `len(b)` is 3, `i = 2` is within the valid range, so the loop will continue.

5. **Other States to Adjust:**
   - The other states (`b`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `res`, `c`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged as there is no indication that they are affected by the loop body or the conditions given.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

- `i` is now 2

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 2; `b` is [2, 3, 5]; `leng` is 3; `mx` is 5; `mx_ind_lt` is 2; `res` is unchanged; `c` is unchanged; `a` is [2, 3, 5]; `s` is {2, 3, 5}**
