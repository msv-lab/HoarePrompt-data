`b` is appended with the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `a[i]` is a valid integer from the list `a`. The value of `b` is updated with this new element. The states of the other variables (`a`, `i`, `s`, `leng`, `k`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `s` is a set, `leng` is an integer, `k` and `m` are integers with `leng` being less than `k // m`, an element in `a` at index `i` is also in set `s`, and `b` is a list with one additional element which is `a[i]`.**
