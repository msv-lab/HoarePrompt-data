According to the code, the loop iterates over the iterable `b` using the index `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is `2m`, `res` has been incremented by `(b[i] + m) * m`, and `b` must be a non-empty iterable.

To determine the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will continue if there are more elements in `b` to iterate over.
2. Since `i` was used as the index in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < len(b)`.

Let's analyze the given information:
- `c` is `2m` (unchanged).
- `res` has been incremented by `(b[i] + m) * m`.
- `b` must be a non-empty iterable (unchanged).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `i` must still be less than `len(b)`.

Assuming that the loop just completed its first iteration, let's denote:
- The initial value of `i` was 0.
- After the first iteration, `i` would be 0.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
- To ensure the loop continues, `i` (which is now 1) must be less than `len(b)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `c` remains `2m`.
- `res` will be incremented by `(b[1] + m) * m` in this next iteration.
- `b` must still be a non-empty iterable.

State: **`c` is `2m`, `res` is incremented by `(b[1] + m) * m`, `b` must be a non-empty iterable.**
