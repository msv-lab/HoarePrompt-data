The variable `c` is incremented by `m`. Given the initial conditions, `c` was either `k % m` or `m`. Since `c` is being incremented by `m`, its new value will be either `(k % m) + m` or `m + m`. However, since `k % m` will always result in a value less than `m`, adding `m` to `k % m` will make it equal to `m`. Therefore, the value of `c` will become `m`.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `leng` remains `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` remain unchanged, `c` is `m`, `res` is `res_initial + (b[1] + c) * m`, `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, and `i` is 2**
