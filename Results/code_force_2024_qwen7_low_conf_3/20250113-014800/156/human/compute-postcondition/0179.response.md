The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state:

- `total` is unchanged
- `t` is unchanged
- `m` is `m_val`
- `k` is `k_val`
- `n` is `n_val`
- `b` is either `[a[i_prev], a[i_prev + 1], a[i_prev + 3]]` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m`, or remains an empty list `[]`
- `mx` is unchanged
- `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged
- `leng` is `1 + (1 if a[i_prev + 3] is in s and leng < k // m else 0)`
- `c` is unchanged
- `res` is unchanged
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input
- `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`
- `i` is `i_prev + 3`

Since `b.append(a[i])` is executed, the value of `b` will now include the element `a[i]`. Therefore, the updated state of `b` will be the previous value of `b` concatenated with `a[i]`.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is `[a[i_prev], a[i_prev + 1], a[i_prev + 3], a[i]]` if `a[i_prev + 3]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m`, or `[a[i]]` if `b` was initially empty or `a[i_prev + 3]` is not in `s` or `leng` is not less than `k // m`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is `1 + (1 if a[i_prev + 3] is in s and leng < k // m else 0)`, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 3`**
