The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `a[i]` is in `s`, the value of `a[i]` is added to the list `b`.

Since `b` was initially an empty list, appending `a[i]` to it changes its content to `[a[i]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is `[a[i]]`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, the length of `leng` is 0, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
