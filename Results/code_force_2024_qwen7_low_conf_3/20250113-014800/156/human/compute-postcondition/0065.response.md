`c` is incremented by `m`. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after adding `m`, the value of `c` becomes `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `b` is a list containing exactly `k // m + 1` integers, `leng` is `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is `m`, `res` is `b[i] * m`, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, `i` is 0**
