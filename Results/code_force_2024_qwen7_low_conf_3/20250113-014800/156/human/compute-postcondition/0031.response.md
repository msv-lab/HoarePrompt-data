`res` is incremented by `(b[i] + c) * m`. Since `c` is equal to `m`, the expression becomes `res += (b[i] + m) * m`. The value of `res` is updated, and the value of `c` remains `m`. The value of `b` and the index `i` are not specified, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is `m`, `res` is incremented by `(b[i] + m) * m`, `b` must be a non-empty iterable.**
