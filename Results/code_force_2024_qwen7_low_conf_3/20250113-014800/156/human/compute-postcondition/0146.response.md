Let's analyze the given information and determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is 0
  - `b` is [2, 3, 5]
  - `leng` is 3
  - `mx` is 5
  - `mx_ind_lt` is 2
  - `res` is either 0 + 2 * (k % m) if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is true, or `res` remains 0
  - `c` is either `c` + (`k` % `m`) if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is true, or `c` is `c + m`
  - `a` is [2, 3, 5]
  - `s` is {2, 3, 5}

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(b)`.
   - Since `len(b)` is 3, the loop will run for `i = 0, 1, 2`.

2. **Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

4. **Checking the List `b`**:
   - `b` is [2, 3, 5].
   - We need to check the values of `b[i]` for `i = 1`.

5. **States to Adjust**:
   - `i` should be updated to 1.
   - All other variables should remain as they are since no modifications are mentioned for the loop body.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `b` is [2, 3, 5], `leng` is 3, `mx` is 5, `mx_ind_lt` is 2, `res` is either 0 + 2 * (k % m) if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is true, or `res` remains 0, `c` is either `c` + (`k` % `m`) if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is true, or `c` is `c + m`, `a` is [2, 3, 5], `s` is {2, 3, 5}**
