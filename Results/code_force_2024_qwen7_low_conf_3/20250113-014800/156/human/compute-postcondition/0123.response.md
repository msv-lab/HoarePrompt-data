The value of `leng` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `b` is an empty list with the added element `a[i]`
- `leng` is now `leng + 1`, which is less than `k // m + 1`
- `mx` is undefined
- `mx_ind_lt` is undefined
- `res` is the initial value as defined
- `c` is as defined
- `a` is `[n, m, k]`
- `s` is the set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`
- The current value of `i` is such that `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`

Output State: **`b` is an empty list with the added element `a[i]`, `leng` is `leng + 1`, `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`, `mx` is undefined, `mx_ind_lt` is undefined, `res` is the initial value as defined, `c` is as defined, `a` is `[n, m, k]`, `s` is the set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`, and the current value of `i` is such that `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`**
