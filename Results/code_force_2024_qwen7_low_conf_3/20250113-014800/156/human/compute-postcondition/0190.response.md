`c` is incremented by `m`. The previous value of `c` was `c + m`, so adding `m` to it results in `c + 2m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res` is `res_initial + 2 * (b[i] + c) * m`, `c` is `c + 2m`, `b` must still have at least one element, `a` must still have enough elements in the first `k_val // m_val` positions to construct `b`, `i` is `i_prev + n_val + 1`.**
