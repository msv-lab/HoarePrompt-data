`c` is incremented by the value of `m`. The values of `res`, `b`, `a`, `i`, `i_prev`, `n_val`, `m_val`, and `k_val` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `res` remains as `res_initial + (b[i] + c) * m`.

Output State: **`res` is `res_initial + (b[i] + c) * m`, `c` is `c + m`, `b` must have at least one element, `a` must have enough elements in the first `k_val // m_val` positions to construct `b`, `i` is `i_prev + n_val`**
