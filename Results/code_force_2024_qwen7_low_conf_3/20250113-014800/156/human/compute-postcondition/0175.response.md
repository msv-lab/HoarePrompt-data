`b` appends the element `a[i]` to its list. Given that `i` is now `i_prev + 2`, the value of `a[i]` is the third element of `a` starting from `i_prev`. The length of `leng` remains unchanged because no operation on `leng` was performed. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is `[a[i_prev], a[i_prev + 1], a[i]]`, `mx` is unchanged, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, the length of `leng` is 1 if `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m`, otherwise it remains 0, `c` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`.**
