The code snippet `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. According to the initial state, `leng` is defined as \((k // m) + 1\) unless `a[j + 2]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than \((k // m)\), in which case `leng` is \((k // m) + 2\). After executing `leng += 1`, `leng` will now be one more than its original value.

Given this, the updated value of `leng` will be \((k // m) + 2\) if `a[j + 2]` was not in `s` and `leng` was already \((k // m) + 1\), or it will be \((k // m) + 3\) if the condition was met, making `leng` \((k // m) + 2\).

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is \(j + 2\), `s` is a set, `b` is a list including `a[j + 2]`, `leng` is \((k // m) + 2` or \((k // m) + 3\)**.
