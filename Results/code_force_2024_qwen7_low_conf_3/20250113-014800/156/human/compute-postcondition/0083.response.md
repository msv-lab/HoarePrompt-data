Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\).
   - `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\).
   - `n` is the last input integer.
   - `b` is a non-empty iterable where `n` is the number of elements in `b`.
   - `mx` is the maximum value in `b`.
   - `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`.
   - `leng` is `k // m + 1`.
   - `c` is `n * m` if `k % m == 0` otherwise `k`.
   - `res` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `b`, `m`, `c`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Update the states at the start of the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current value of the loop counter.
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the above, we need to update the state for the next iteration of the loop. Specifically, we need to adjust the value of `i`.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `m`, `k`, `n`, `b`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `leng`, `c`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their previous values.

Therefore, the state adjustment for the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\); `n` is the last input integer; `b` is a non-empty iterable where `n` is the number of elements in `b`; `mx` is the maximum value in `b`; `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`; `leng` is `k // m + 1`; `c` is `n * m` if `k % m == 0` otherwise `k`; `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + (j-1)*m) * m` for all `i` in `range(len(b))` and `j` ranging from 1 to `n` if `k % m == 0` otherwise the sum of `(b[i] + c) * m` for all `i` in `range(leng)` where `b[i] != mx` and `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for the last occurrence of `mx`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
