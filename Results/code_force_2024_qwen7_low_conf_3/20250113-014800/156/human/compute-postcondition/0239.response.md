The code `print(res)` prints the value of the variable `res` but does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `res` remains the same as it was before the print statement.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is `m_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is either unchanged or a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` with `leng` being the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `c` is the final value of `c` after all iterations, `res` is the final value of `res` after all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, and `i` is the final value of `i` after all iterations.**
