`res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value. Given the initial state, `c` is 0, and `b` is a non-empty iterable. However, the specific values of `b` and `m` are not provided. The value of `res` is incremented by `(b[i] + 0) * m`, which simplifies to `b[i] * m`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 0, `res` is incremented by `b[i] * m`, `b` must be a non-empty iterable.

Output State: **`c` is 0, `res` is incremented by `b[i] * m`, `b` must be a non-empty iterable.**
