Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students (though not used in the loop), `b` is a list containing exactly `k // m + 1` integers, `leng` is `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is 0, `res` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, `i` is 0, the current value of `i` is 0, and both the `b[i]` and `mx` are equal with `i` being equal to `mx_ind_lt`**
