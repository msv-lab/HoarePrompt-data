The code snippet `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `i+1`, `b` is either unchanged or includes the new element if the condition was met, `leng` is either unchanged or incremented by 1, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined if the condition was not met, `res` remains the initial value, `c` remains as defined, and `a` remains unchanged. Since `i` is initially set to `i+1`, it means `i` is already updated to its new value. The value of `a[i]` is appended to `b`, so `b` now includes this new element.

Output State: **`i` is `i+1`, `b` includes the new element `a[i]`, `leng` is incremented by 1, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined, `res` remains the initial value, `c` remains as defined, and `a` remains unchanged.**
