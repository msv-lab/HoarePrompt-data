The code `res += (b[i] + c) * m` impacts the following variables:
- `res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value.
- `i` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `b` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined as they were initially.
- `leng` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `c` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `a` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `s` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`.
- `b` must contain at least `n` elements.
- `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are undefined.
- `leng` is `k // m`.
- `c` is `m`.
- `res` is `b[n-1] * m`.
- `a` is the list `[n, m, k]`.
- `s` is the set containing the first `k // m` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`.

Let's calculate the new value of `res`:
- `b[i]` is `b[n]` since `i` is `n`.
- `c` is `m`.
- So, `(b[i] + c) * m` becomes `(b[n] + m) * m`.

Therefore, the new value of `res` is `b[n-1] * m + (b[n] + m) * m`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`; `b` must contain at least `n` elements; `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are undefined; `leng` is `k // m`; `c` is `m`; `res` is `b[n-1] * m + (b[n] + m) * m`; `a` is the list `[n, m, k]`; `s` is the set containing the first `k // m` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`.**
