Postcondition: ***`b` is an empty list, `leng` is 0, `mx` is undefined, `mx_ind_lt` is undefined, `res` is the initial value as defined, `c` is as defined, `a` is `[n, m, k]`, `s` is the set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted list `[n, m, k]`. If `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, then `b` contains the element `a[i]`, `leng` is incremented by 1, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined, `res` remains the initial value, `c` remains as defined, and `a` remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, the values of `b`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `res`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged.***
