Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `leng` remains `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` remain unchanged, `c` is `k`, `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + c) * m` for all `i` in `range(leng)` where `b[i] != mx` and `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for the last occurrence of `mx`, `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, and `i` is `leng`.**
