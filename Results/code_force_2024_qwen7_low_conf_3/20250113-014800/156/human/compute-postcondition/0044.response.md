`leng` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`, the new value of `leng` will still be less than `k // m + 1` because only 1 has been added to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `s` is a set, `leng` is an integer such that `leng < k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers, and `b` is a list with one additional integer `a[i]` appended to it; `leng` is increased by 1.**
