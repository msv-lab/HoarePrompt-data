The code `mx_ind_lt = max(i for i in range(len(b)) if b[i] == mx)` finds the index of the maximum value in the list `b` that is equal to `mx`. 

Let's break down the steps:

1. The `max()` function is used with a generator expression `(i for i in range(len(b)) if b[i] == mx)`.
2. This generator expression iterates over the indices of the list `b` where the corresponding element is equal to `mx`.
3. It then returns the maximum of these indices.

Since the exact values of `a`, `s`, `b`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `res`, and `mx` are not provided, we can only express the updated state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements from the sorted version of `a`, `b` is a list containing all integers from `a` that are in `s` and the number of such integers is exactly `k // m + 1`, `leng` is `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is 0, `res` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`.**
