Postcondition: ***`total` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k_val`, `n` is `n_val`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` that are in `s` and `leng` is the number of such elements, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b`, `i` is either `i_new + 1` or `i_val + 1`, and `res` is updated to `res + (b[i_new] + c) * (k % m)` or `res + (b[i_val] + c) * m` as per the condition inside the if-else block.***
