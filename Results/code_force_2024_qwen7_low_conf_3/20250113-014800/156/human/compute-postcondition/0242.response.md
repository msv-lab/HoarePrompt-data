The function `func` accepts a list of parameters. Specifically, it accepts:
- An integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\).
- A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. Since the problem statement does not specify what the function should return, the most accurate description of the function's return value is that it depends on the internal logic of the function, which is not provided here.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `t` and for each of the `t` test cases, it accepts additional integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers representing ticket prices, and returns a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. It returns a value based on these inputs.**
