The code `res += (b[i] + c) * m` updates the value of `res` by adding the product of `(b[i] + c)` and `m` to its current value. Let's break this down:

- Initially, `c` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `(b[i] + 0) * m`, which is just `b[i] * m`.
- `b[i]` is one of the elements in the list `b`, and since `b[i]` is not equal to `mx`, it means `b[i]` is not the maximum value in `b`.

Therefore, the value added to `res` is `b[i] * m`. Since the initial value of `res` is 0, after this operation, `res` will be `b[i] * m`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `total` remains 0.
- `students_list` remains a list of students.
- `b` remains a list containing exactly `k // m + 1` integers.
- `leng` remains `k // m + 1`.
- `k` and `m` remain positive integers.
- `c` remains 0.
- `mx` remains the maximum value in `b`.
- `mx_ind_lt` remains the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`.
- `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `b` is a list containing exactly `k // m + 1` integers, `leng` is `k // m + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is 0, `res` is `b[i] * m`, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the maximum value in `b` that equals `mx`, `i` is 0**.
