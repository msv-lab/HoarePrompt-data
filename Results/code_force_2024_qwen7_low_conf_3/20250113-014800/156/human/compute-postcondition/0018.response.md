The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. The initial value of `leng` is \((k // m) + 1\). After executing the code, the value of `leng` becomes \((k // m) + 2\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a` such that `i` is `j+1` where `j` is the index at the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a set, `b` is a list that may have an additional element if `a[j+1]` is in `s`, `leng` is \((k // m) + 2\)**.
