The code appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is an index within the range of `a` and `i + 2 < n`, and `a[i]` is an integer, the value of `b` will include the new element `a[i]` at its last position. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a` and `i + 2 < n`, `s` is a set, `leng` is an integer that may have been incremented by 1, `k` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list with the integer `a[i]` appended to it.**
