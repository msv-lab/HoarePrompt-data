The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. Since `leng` was initially incremented by `i+1`, the current value of `leng` is `i+2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i+1`, `b` includes the new element `a[i]`, `leng` is `i+2`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain undefined, `res` remains the initial value, `c` remains as defined, and `a` remains unchanged.**
