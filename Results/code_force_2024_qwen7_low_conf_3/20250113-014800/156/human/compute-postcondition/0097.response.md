`leng` is incremented by 1. The original value of `leng` is 1, so after the increment, `leng` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `b`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a list containing `a[1]` if `a[1]` is in `s`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` are undefined, and `leng` is 2.**
