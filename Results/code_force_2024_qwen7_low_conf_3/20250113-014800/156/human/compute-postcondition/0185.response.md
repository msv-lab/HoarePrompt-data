To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of list `b`. For the loop to execute, `b` must contain at least one element.

2. **List `b` Definition**: The list `b` is defined as follows:
   - Each element `b[j]` is `a[i]` if `a[i]` is in `s` and `j` is the index such that `i = i_prev + j * (k_val // m_val)`.
   - This means that `b` is constructed based on the indices derived from `i_prev` and the division of `k_val // m_val`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `total` is unchanged.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `m` is `m_val`.
   - `k` is `k_val`.
   - `n` is `n_val`.
   - `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[j]` is derived from `a[i]` if `a[i]` is in `s`.
   - `mx` is unchanged.
   - `mx_ind_lt` is unchanged.
   - `leng` is `k_val // m_val` if `b` is filled completely, otherwise it is less than `k_val // m_val`.
   - `c` is `0`.
   - `res` is `0`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `s` is a set containing the first `k_val // m_val` elements of the sorted list `a`.
   - `i` is `i_prev + n_val`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - The loop will execute if `b` contains at least one element. This means that there must be at least one `a[i]` in `s` that satisfies the condition `i = i_prev + j * (k_val // m_val)` for some valid `j`.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - `b` must have at least one element. This ensures that the loop can iterate at least once.
   - Since `b` is dependent on `a` and `s`, `a` must have enough elements in the first `k_val // m_val` positions to satisfy the conditions for constructing `b`.
   - `i` should be initialized correctly based on `i_prev` and `n_val`.

Based on this analysis, the required states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `b` must have at least one element.
- `a` must have enough elements in the first `k_val // m_val` positions to construct `b`.
- `i` should be `i_prev + n_val`.

Therefore, the state adjustment is as follows:

State: **`b` must have at least one element, `a` must have enough elements in the first `k_val // m_val` positions to construct `b`, `i` is `i_prev + n_val`**
