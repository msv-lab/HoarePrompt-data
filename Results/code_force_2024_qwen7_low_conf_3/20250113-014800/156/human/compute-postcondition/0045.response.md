Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `s` is a set, `leng` is an integer, `k` and `m` are positive integers, and `b` is a list with one additional integer `a[i]` appended to it; if `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, then `leng` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.***
