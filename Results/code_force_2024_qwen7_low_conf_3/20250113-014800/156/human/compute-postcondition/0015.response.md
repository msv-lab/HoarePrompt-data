Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `s` is a set, `leng` is `(k // m) + 1`, `k` and `m` are integers with `leng` being less than `k // m`. If an element in `a` at index `i` is also in set `s`, then `b` is a list with one additional element which is `a[i]`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
