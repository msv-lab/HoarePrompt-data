The value of `leng` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `leng` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a` and `i + 1 < n`, `s` is a set, `leng` is an integer plus 1, `k` and `m` are positive integers, and `b` is a list with the integer `a[i]` appended to it.**
