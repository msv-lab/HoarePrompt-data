t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m_1, and m_2 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1} are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n; s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2} are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n.
