The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `T`, an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `k`, an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `a`, a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Additionally, the function has a `max_subarray_sum` which is a function that returns the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm applied to the list `a`.

The function does not have a direct return statement provided in the given information, but based on typical use cases, it could return results for each test case or a summary of results. However, since no specific return type is mentioned, we can assume it processes the data according to the given constraints and the `max_subarray_sum` function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (number of test cases), n (an integer), k (an integer), and a (a list of integers). It uses a function max_subarray_sum, which applies Kadane's algorithm to list a, to process the data according to the given constraints.**
