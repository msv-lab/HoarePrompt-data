State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element other than the first one, `max_ending_here` is `arr[0]`, `max_so_far` is `arr[0]`, `x` is the second element in the list and is currently equal to `arr[1]`**.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `max_ending_here` is initialized to `arr[0]`.
   - `max_so_far` is also initialized to `arr[0]`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for x in arr[1:]:` will start iterating from the second element of the list `arr`. For this loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least one element after the first one (i.e., `arr[1:]` should not be an empty list).

3. **Loop Body Initialization**: The loop body starts with `x` being the second element in the list, which is `arr[1]`. 

4. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure the loop can start executing:
   - `arr` must have at least two elements (one for `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far`, and another for the loop to start).
   - `x` is set to the second element of the list (`arr[1]`) during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to include the condition that `arr` must have at least one additional element beyond the first one, and `x` is set to the second element in the list (`arr[1]`).
