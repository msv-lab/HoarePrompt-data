The code updates the `max_ending_here` variable to be the maximum of `x` (which is `arr[1]`) and `max_ending_here + x`. Initially, `max_ending_here` is set to `arr[0]`.

- If `arr[1]` (the value of `x`) is greater than or equal to `arr[0] + arr[1]`, then `max_ending_here` will be updated to `arr[1]`.
- Otherwise, `max_ending_here` will remain `arr[0] + arr[1]`.

Given this logic, the value of `max_ending_here` depends on the comparison between `arr[1]` and `arr[0] + arr[1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element other than the first one, `max_ending_here` is either `arr[1]` if `arr[1] >= arr[0] + arr[1]` else `arr[0] + arr[1]`, `max_so_far` is `arr[0]`, `x` is the second element in the list and is currently equal to `arr[1]`**
