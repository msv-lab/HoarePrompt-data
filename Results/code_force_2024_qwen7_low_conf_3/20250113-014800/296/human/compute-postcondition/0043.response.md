To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements for the loop to start and iterate properly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop is defined as `for result in results:`. This means the loop will iterate over the elements of the `results` list.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

2. **Variable `result`**:
   - Inside the loop, `result` is assigned to the current element from the `results` list during each iteration.
   - No modification of `result` is required before the loop starts, but we need to ensure there is at least one element in `results`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `T`, `MOD`, `index`, `data`, `a`, `initial_sum`, and `max_subarray_sum` are not directly involved in the loop execution itself. They are likely used within the loop body but do not need adjustment for the loop to start executing.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the `results` list contains at least one element.

### Final State:

State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
