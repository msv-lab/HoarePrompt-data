The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `index` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2, `data` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, `max_subarray_sum` is updated to `new_max_subarray_sum`, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum` > 0, otherwise `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`, `results` is a list containing the value of `result` appended to it, and `index` is the original value of `index` + 2.**
