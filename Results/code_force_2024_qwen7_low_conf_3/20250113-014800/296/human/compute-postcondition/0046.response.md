The code `print(result)` prints the value of the variable `result`. This does not change the value of `result` or `results`, but it does output the current value of `result`. Given the initial state where `results` must contain at least one element and `result` is the next element in the list, the only thing that changes is that the value of `result` is printed.

Output State: **`results` contains at least one element; the value of `result` is printed**
