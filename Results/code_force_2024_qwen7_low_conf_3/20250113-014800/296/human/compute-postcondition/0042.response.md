Output State: **`T` is 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, `results` is a list containing the results computed for each iteration, `index` is the original value of `index` + the sum of `n` for all iterations, `data` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD` for each iteration, `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum computed using Kadane's algorithm for each iteration, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum` > 0, otherwise `result` is `initial_sum % MOD` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `T` times. After executing the loop, `T` will be reduced to 0 because `T` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it becomes 0.
- `MOD` remains 1000000007 throughout the execution.
- `results` contains the final computed results for all iterations.
- `index` will be incremented by the sum of all `n` values across all iterations plus 2 for each iteration.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- For each iteration, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` based on the current value of `n`.
- `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD` for each iteration.
- `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum computed using Kadane's algorithm for each iteration.
- `result` is calculated as `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum` is greater than 0, otherwise it is `initial_sum % MOD`.
