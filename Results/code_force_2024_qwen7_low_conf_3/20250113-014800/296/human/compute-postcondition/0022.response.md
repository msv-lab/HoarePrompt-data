`index` is incremented by 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `index` is the original value of `index` + 2 + `n` + 2.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 4 + `n`, `data` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, if `max_subarray_sum` is greater than 0, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `result`**
