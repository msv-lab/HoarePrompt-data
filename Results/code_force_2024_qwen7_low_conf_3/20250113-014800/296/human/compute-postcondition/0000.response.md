The code initializes two variables `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far` with the first element of the list `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

- `max_ending_here` is assigned `arr[0]`.
- `max_so_far` is also assigned `arr[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_ending_here` is `arr[0]`, `max_so_far` is `arr[0]`**
