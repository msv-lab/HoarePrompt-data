The code updates `max_so_far` to be the maximum value between `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`. However, the initial value of `max_ending_here` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. It is stated that `max_ending_here` is either `x` (the third element in the list) or `initial_max_ending_here + x`, depending on the initial value of `max_ending_here`.

Since the exact value of `max_so_far` before this line of code is not given, we can only express `max_so_far` in terms of its current value and `max_ending_here`.

Given that `x` is the third element in the list and `max_ending_here` is either `x` or `initial_max_ending_here + x`, the updated `max_so_far` will be the maximum of the current `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `max_so_far` is the maximum of the current `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`, where `max_ending_here` is either `x` or `initial_max_ending_here + x` depending on the initial value of `max_ending_here`.**
