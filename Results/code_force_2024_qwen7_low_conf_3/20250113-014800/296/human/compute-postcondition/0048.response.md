The code `print(result)` simply prints the value of `result`. It does not change the value of `result` or any other variables. Therefore, the only thing that changes is that the value of `result` is printed. Since the initial state is that `results` contains at least one element and the value of `result` is printed, the output state remains that `results` contains at least one element and the value of `result` has been printed.

Output State: **`results` contains at least one element, the value of `result` has been printed**
