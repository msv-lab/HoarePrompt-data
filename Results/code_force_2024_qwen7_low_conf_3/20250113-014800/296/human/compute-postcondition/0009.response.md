The code updates `max_so_far` to be the maximum of its current value (`max_so_far`) and `max_ending_here`. Since `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`, and `x` is the fourth element in the list, `max_ending_here` now holds the maximum sum of a subarray ending at the fourth element.

After this line of code executes, `max_so_far` will hold the maximum of its previous value and the updated `max_ending_here`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least four elements, `x` is the fourth element in the list, `max_so_far` is the maximum of the previous `max_so_far` and the updated `max_ending_here`, where `max_ending_here` is the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`.**
