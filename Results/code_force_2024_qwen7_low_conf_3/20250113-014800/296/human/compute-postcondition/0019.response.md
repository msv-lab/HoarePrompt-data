The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. This does not change the values of the other variables. The value of `results` is updated, but no specific value is given for `results` in the initial state, so we only know that `results` now contains the value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2 + `n`, `data` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, if `max_subarray_sum` is greater than 0, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `result`.**
