Functionality: **The function `kadane` accepts a list of integers `arr` and computes the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the input list. It returns this maximum subarray sum. The function iterates through the list while maintaining two variables: `max_ending_here`, which keeps track of the maximum subarray sum ending at the current position, and `max_so_far`, which stores the maximum subarray sum found so far. If the current element alone is greater than the sum of the current element and `max_ending_here`, then `max_ending_here` is updated to the current element. Otherwise, `max_ending_here` is updated to the sum of the current element and `max_ending_here`. The function also handles edge cases such as when all elements in the list are negative, in which case `max_so_far` will be the largest (least negative) number in the list.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If the list `arr` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access `arr[0]` without checking if the list is empty. To handle this, an initial check should be added to return 0 if `arr` is empty.
- If all elements in the list are negative, the function correctly identifies the largest (least negative) number as the maximum subarray sum.

**Missing functionality:**
- There is no handling for the case where the list might contain only one element. In such a case, `max_so_far` should be initialized to `arr[0]` to ensure correct behavior.
