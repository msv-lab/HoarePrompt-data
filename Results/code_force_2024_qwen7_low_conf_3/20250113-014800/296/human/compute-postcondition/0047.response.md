According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one element, and the value of `result` is printed. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element, and the loop will print the next element in `results`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`results` contains at least one element, the value of `result` is printed**
