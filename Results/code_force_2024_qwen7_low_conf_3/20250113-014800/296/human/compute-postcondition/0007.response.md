Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements.
   - `x` is the third element in the list.
   - `max_so_far` is the maximum of the current `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`, where `max_ending_here` is either `x` or `initial_max_ending_here + x` depending on the initial value of `max_ending_here`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in arr[1:]:
   ```
   This means the loop starts from the second element of `arr` (index 1) and goes through each subsequent element.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the third element in the list (`arr[2]`).
   - The condition `arr` having at least three elements remains true because we are only advancing to the next element in the list.
   - `max_so_far` is updated based on the logic involving `max_ending_here` and `x`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to process the fourth element of the list (`arr[3]`).
   - The variable `x` will now represent the fourth element of the list.
   - The condition `arr` having at least three elements still holds because the list must have at least four elements to reach the fourth element.
   - `max_so_far` will be updated again based on the new value of `x` and the previous `max_ending_here`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `arr` must have at least four elements.
   - `x` will be the fourth element of the list (`arr[3]`).
   - `max_so_far` will be updated but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the values of the list and the previous `max_ending_here`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least four elements, `x` is the fourth element in the list, `max_so_far` is the maximum of the current `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`**.
