According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` must have contained at least one element, and `result` was printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element, and `result` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`results` must contain at least one element, `result` is the next element in the list**
