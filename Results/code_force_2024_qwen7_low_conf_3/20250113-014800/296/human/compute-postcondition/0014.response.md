Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` + 2 + `n`, `data` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a`, and `max_subarray_sum` is greater than 0***
