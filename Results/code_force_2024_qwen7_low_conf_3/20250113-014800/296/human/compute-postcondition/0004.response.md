Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element other than the first one.
   - `max_so_far` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and either `arr[1]` or `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
   - `max_ending_here` is either `arr[1]` if `arr[1] >= arr[0] + arr[1]` else `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
   - `x` is the second element in the list and is currently equal to `arr[1]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in arr[1:]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop starts iterating from `x = arr[1]`.
   - The loop condition is that it continues as long as there are elements left in `arr[1:]`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since we are at the start of the next iteration, `x` will now be the third element of the list, i.e., `arr[2]`.
   - To continue the loop, `arr` must have at least one more element beyond the current `x`, which means `arr` must have at least three elements (i.e., `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]`).

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `max_so_far` will be updated based on the new value of `x` (which is now `arr[2]`) and the previous `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` will be updated similarly.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `arr` must have at least three elements.
   - `x` is now the third element in the list, i.e., `arr[2]`.
   - The values of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here` will be updated but not explicitly stated here since they depend on the loop body.

Therefore, the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in the list**.
