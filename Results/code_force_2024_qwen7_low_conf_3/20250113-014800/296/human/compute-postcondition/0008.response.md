The code updates the value of `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`. Given that `x` is the fourth element in the list `arr`, the value of `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`.

Since the initial state of `max_so_far` is defined as the maximum of the current `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`, this value remains unchanged unless it was updated within the same operation, which it wasn't in this snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least four elements, `x` is the fourth element in the list, `max_so_far` is the maximum of the current `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`; `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`.**
