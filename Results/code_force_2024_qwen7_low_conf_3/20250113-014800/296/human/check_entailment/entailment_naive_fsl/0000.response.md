Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` and `kadane` do not relate to the problem description at all. The problem requires determining the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, but the code instead calculates a sum using Kadane's algorithm, which is used for finding the maximum subarray sum. This has no relevance to the given problem.

The code should focus on analyzing the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums to determine the number of valid permutations, which involves combinatorial logic rather than subarray sums. Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
