Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Function Name and Purpose**: The function `func_1` is named to suggest it might be solving the problem, but its implementation does not match the problem's requirements. It incorrectly uses Kadane's algorithm, which is used for finding the maximum subarray sum, which is irrelevant to this problem.

2. **Incorrect Use of Kadane's Algorithm**: Kadane's algorithm is applied here, which is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. This algorithm is not needed for the problem, as the problem requires determining the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, not the maximum sum of any subarray.

3. **Misunderstanding the Problem Requirements**: The problem requires constructing permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. However, the code reads input and attempts to compute a result using an unrelated algorithm. It does not attempt to construct permutations or verify them against the given conditions.

4. **Modulo Operation**: While the code correctly applies the modulo operation (`% MOD`) at certain points, it does so in a context where it has no meaning related to the problem statement. The modulo should be applied to the count of valid permutations, but this count is never calculated.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
