### Your Response:

Reasoning:
1. **Function Name and Purpose**: The function `func_1` is named `func_1`, which is not descriptive but does attempt to solve the problem. However, it does not correctly implement the solution. The function `kadane` is correctly implemented and serves its intended purpose of finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it is incorrectly applied in `func_1`.

2. **Incorrect Application of Kadane's Algorithm**: While the problem does not directly involve finding the maximum subarray sum, the algorithm itself is not the issue. The problem requires constructing permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The key misunderstanding is in how the algorithm is used. The algorithm can be useful in certain parts of the solution, such as determining the number of valid positions for the maximum elements in the permutation.

3. **Permutation Construction**: The core issue is that the program does not correctly construct or count the permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires a more complex approach involving combinatorial counting and placement of elements.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure the result fits within the required constraints, but it is not used in the right context. The modulo should be applied to the final count of valid permutations, which is not computed in the given code.

5. **Summary Analysis**: The function summary for `kadane` is correct and describes the functionality accurately. However, the main function `func_1` does not utilize this correctly. The program reads the input, processes it, and then attempts to use an algorithm that is not relevant to the problem's solution.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
