Reasoning:
- The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem, but there is a critical misunderstanding in the approach used. The program is using Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum, which is not relevant to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires identifying specific positions of prefix and suffix maximums, not finding the maximum subarray sum.

- The correct approach would involve using the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums to determine how many permutations can satisfy these conditions. This involves combinatorial counting and ensuring the positions of maximums do not violate the constraints of being a prefix or suffix maximum.

- The provided `func_1` function is incorrectly calculating something unrelated to the problem requirements. It reads the input, calculates an initial sum and a maximum subarray sum, and then uses these values in a way that does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, it should be checking the positions of prefix and suffix maximums and counting valid permutations based on those positions.

- The `kadane` function is correctly implemented but is being misused in the main function.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
