Reasoning:
- The function `func_1()` is intended to process a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs and computes a result based on those inputs.
- The core logic in `func_1()` incorrectly applies Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum, which is not relevant to solving the given problem. The problem requires determining the number of permutations that fit certain criteria based on prefix and suffix maximums, not finding the maximum subarray sum.
- Kadane's algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array, which is irrelevant here. The solution should instead focus on constructing permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
- The `kadane()` function is correctly implemented and is indeed the correct approach for finding the maximum subarray sum, but it is being misapplied in `func_1()`.
- Given that `func_1()` uses Kadane's algorithm inappropriately and the overall logic is flawed, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
