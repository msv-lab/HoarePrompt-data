Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. However, the implementation is flawed because:
     - The function should take two integers as arguments, but currently, it takes a list `a` and an integer `b`.
     - The logic inside the function does not correctly compute the GCD of two numbers. Instead, it attempts to update `a` with remainders and return `a`, which is not meaningful.
     - To fix this, `func_1` should be corrected to take two integers and return their GCD. Here is the corrected version:
       ```python
       def func_1(a, b):
           while b:
               a, b = b, a % b
           return a
       ```

2. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD in `func_2`**:
   - In `func_2`, the GCD is calculated incorrectly:
     - `gcd1` is computed as the GCD of the last two elements in the sorted list `a` (`a[-1]` and `a[-2]`). This is not generally the correct way to compute the GCD of all elements in `a` minus two.
     - Similarly, `gcd2` is computed as the GCD of all elements except the first two (`a[2:]`). Again, this is not necessarily the correct way to compute the GCD of all elements minus two.
     - The correct approach would be to use `reduce` from the `functools` module to compute the GCD of all elements in the relevant sublists.

3. **Incorrect Bitwise AND Calculation**:
   - The bitwise AND calculation in `func_2` is incorrect. Specifically:
     - `and1` is computed as the bitwise AND of all elements except the last two (`a[:-2]`).
     - `and2` is computed as the bitwise AND of the first two elements (`a[0] & a[1]`).
     - The correct approach would be to use `reduce` to compute the bitwise AND of the relevant sublists.

4. **Incorrect Output Formatting**:
   - The output format specified in the problem description requires specific line breaks and formatting. The current implementation uses `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` which may not produce the exact formatting required by the problem statement. The output should explicitly adhere to the specified format.

To summarize, the program needs to be fixed to correctly implement the GCD and bitwise AND operations and to ensure the output adheres to the specified format. Once these corrections are made, the program will accurately follow the problem description.
