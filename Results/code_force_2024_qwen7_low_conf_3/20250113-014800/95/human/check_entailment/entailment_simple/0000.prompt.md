You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import math
from functools import reduce

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length n (4 ≤ n ≤ 4·10^5), b is an integer (0 ≤ b ≤ 4·10^5). The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is a list of integers where each element is the remainder of the original element divided by the initial value of `b`; `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a list 'a' where each element is the remainder of the original element divided by 0, which is undefined.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, and x is an integer. The array a is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and 4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5, 0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5. Each element in a is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5.
def func_2():
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a.sort()
        
        gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])
        
        and1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])
        
        if gcd1 > and1 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))
            continue
        
        gcd2 = reduce(gcd, a[2:])
        
        and2 = a[0] & a[1]
        
        if gcd2 > and2 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])))
            results.append(f'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}')
            continue
        
        results.append('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, each integer in `a` is such that `1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5`, `index` is an integer indicating the current position in the `data` list, `results` is a list of strings containing the final results of the loop executions, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
