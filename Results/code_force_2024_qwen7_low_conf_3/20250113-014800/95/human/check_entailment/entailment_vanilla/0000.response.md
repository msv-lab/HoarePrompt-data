Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - Kirill selects 2 numbers from the array and encircles them in red.
   - Anton encircles all other numbers in blue.
   - Kirill computes the GCD of the red numbers.
   - Anton computes the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and adds \(x\) to it.
   - Kirill wins if his GCD value is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and \(x\).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines a function `func_1` to compute the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_2`, which processes each test case.
   - In `func_2`, the input is read from `data`, and for each test case, it:
     - Reads \(n\) and \(x\).
     - Reads the array \(a\).
     - Sorts the array.
     - Checks two conditions:
       - If the GCD of the last two elements (considered red) is greater than the bitwise AND of the rest plus \(x\).
       - If the GCD of the first \(n-2\) elements (considered blue) is greater than the bitwise AND of the first two elements plus \(x\).
     - Appends the appropriate result to `results`.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach in `func_2` correctly checks both conditions specified in the problem.
   - The sorting step helps in easily selecting the last two elements for red and the first two for blue.
   - The GCD and bitwise AND calculations are correctly implemented.
   - The logic handles all possible test cases as per the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles edge cases like when the array has only 4 elements or more, ensuring that at least one valid selection is made.
   - The logic ensures that if either condition is met, Kirill wins, and the appropriate numbers are selected.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
