### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding whether Kirill can choose 2 numbers from the array to maximize his chances of winning. The rules state that Kirill wins if the GCD of the chosen numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of the remaining numbers plus an integer \( x \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the GCD correctly but does not modify the input list as stated in the docstring.
   - **Function `func_2()`**: This function processes the input data for each test case. It sorts the array, computes GCD and bitwise AND for different segments of the array, and checks the winning condition. The logic for determining the winner is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly handles the sorting of the array, which is crucial for computing the GCD of the last two elements and the bitwise AND of the first two elements and the rest.
   - It checks two possible conditions to see if Kirill can win:
     - Checking the GCD of the last two elements against the bitwise AND of the rest plus \( x \).
     - Checking the GCD of the first two elements and the rest against the bitwise AND of the first two elements plus \( x \).
   - The function outputs the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints appropriately and ensures that the sum of the lengths of arrays across all test cases does not exceed the limit.
   - It correctly identifies when Kirill cannot win and outputs 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the function `func_2()` correctly implements the logic to determine if Kirill can win the game for each test case. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
