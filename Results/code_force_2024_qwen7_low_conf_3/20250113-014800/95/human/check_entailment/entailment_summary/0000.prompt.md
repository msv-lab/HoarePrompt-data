You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import sys
import math
from functools import reduce

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `b`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a[0]` and `b`. After the loop terminates, the function returns a modified version of the list `a` where each element is replaced by its remainder when divided by the GCD of `a[0]` and `b`. However, due to an error in the postcondition annotation, the function incorrectly returns a list where each element is the remainder of the original element divided by 0, which is undefined. The actual functionality is to compute the GCD and then replace each element in `a` with its remainder when divided by the GCD.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        a.sort()
        gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])
        and1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])
        if gcd1 > and1 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))
            continue
        gcd2 = reduce(gcd, a[2:])
        and2 = a[0] & a[1]
        if gcd2 > and2 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])))
            results.append(f'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}')
            continue
        results.append('NO')
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. For each test case, the function calculates two GCD values (`gcd1` and `gcd2`) and one bitwise AND value (`and1` and `and2`). It then checks if either of these conditions hold true:
1. `gcd1 > and1 + x` for the last two elements of the array.
2. `gcd2 > and2 + x` for the first two elements and the rest of the array.

If either condition is satisfied, the function appends 'YES' along with specific parts of the array to the results list. If neither condition is satisfied, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to standard output in the specified format.
