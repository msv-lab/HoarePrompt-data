### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness against the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - Kirill and Anton play a game with an array of integers \(a\) of length \(n\).
   - Kirill chooses 2 numbers and encircles them in red.
   - Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
   - Kirill calculates the GCD of the red numbers.
   - Anton calculates the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and adds \(x\) to the result.
   - Kirill wins if his GCD is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and \(x\).

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **Function `func_2`**: Correctly reads input, sorts the array, and checks the conditions for Kirill to win.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the array helps in easily selecting the last two elements for red and the first two for blue.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The GCD calculation is correct and efficient.
   - **Bitwise AND Calculation**: The bitwise AND operation is performed correctly.
   - **Condition Checks**: The conditions are checked correctly, ensuring Kirill wins if either condition is met.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles arrays with 4 or more elements, ensuring that at least one valid selection is made.
   - The logic ensures that if either condition is met, Kirill wins, and the appropriate numbers are selected.

5. **Detailed Verification**:
   - **Sorting and Indexing**:
     - The array is sorted, making it easy to select the last two elements for red and the first two for blue.
     - The indices for slicing the array are correct.
   - **GCD and AND Operations**:
     - The GCD operations use the Euclidean algorithm correctly.
     - The bitwise AND operations use the `reduce` function correctly.
   - **Condition Checks**:
     - The first condition checks the GCD of the last two elements.
     - The second condition checks the GCD of the first \(n-2\) elements.
     - Both conditions are checked correctly, and the appropriate results are appended to the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The sorting step ensures that the conditions can be checked easily, and the GCD and bitwise AND operations are performed accurately. The edge cases are handled appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
