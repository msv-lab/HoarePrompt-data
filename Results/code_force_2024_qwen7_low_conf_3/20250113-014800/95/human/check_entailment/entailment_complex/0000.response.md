### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given code and the logic behind the functions to determine if the program is correct.

#### Function 1 Analysis:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    
    return a
```
This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a[0]` and `b`. The GCD is stored in `a` at the end of the function. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the explanation of the function. The function should just return the GCD of `a[0]` and `b`, but it currently modifies the list `a`. 

#### Function 2 Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        a.sort()
        gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])
        and1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])
        if gcd1 > and1 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))
            continue
        gcd2 = reduce(gcd, a[2:])
        and2 = a[0] & a[1]
        if gcd2 > and2 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])))
            results.append(f'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}')
            continue
        results.append('NO')
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
```

1. **Initialization**: The function reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it:
   - Reads `n` and `x`.
   - Reads and sorts the array `a`.
   - Computes `gcd1` using the last two elements of `a` and `gcd2` using the first two elements and the rest of the array.
   - Checks the conditions:
     - If `gcd1 > and1 + x`, it appends 'YES' and the appropriate output.
     - If `gcd2 > and2 + x`, it appends 'YES' and the appropriate output.
   - If neither condition holds, it appends 'NO'.
3. **Output**: It writes the results to standard output.

### Correctness Check:

- **Function 1**: The function is logically correct but incorrectly modifies the input list `a`. It should simply return the GCD of `a[0]` and `b`.

- **Function 2**: The logic appears to be correct in terms of checking the conditions and determining the winner. However, the function should ensure that the GCD calculations are performed correctly without modifying the input array `a`.

Given the above analysis, the primary issue is with Function 1, which incorrectly modifies the input list. However, the overall logic of Function 2 seems to correctly implement the rules of the game and check the conditions as required.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issue with Function 1, the core logic of Function 2 is correct. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is maintained.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
