You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. For each test case, the function calculates two GCD values (`gcd1` and `gcd2`) and one bitwise AND value (`and1` and `and2`). It then checks if either of these conditions hold true:
1. `gcd1 > and1 + x` for the last two elements of the array.
2. `gcd2 > and2 + x` for the first two elements and the rest of the array.

If either condition is satisfied, the function appends 'YES' along with specific parts of the array to the results list. If neither condition is satisfied, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to standard output in the specified format.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the edge cases specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the GCD for the red numbers and the bitwise AND for the blue numbers in all scenarios.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 1
4 3 1 8
```

According to the problem description:
- Kirill can choose 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircle them in red. Here, he can choose 2 numbers from the array.
- Anton will encircle the remaining numbers in blue.

In this case, the red numbers can be either `[4, 3]`, `[4, 1]`, `[4, 8]`, `[3, 1]`, `[3, 8]`, or `[1, 8]`.

The GCD of `4` and `3` is `1`.
The GCD of `4` and `1` is `1`.
The GCD of `4` and `8` is `4`.
The GCD of `3` and `1` is `1`.
The GCD of `3` and `8` is `1`.
The GCD of `1` and `8` is `1`.

The bitwise AND of the blue numbers in the case of `[4, 3]` in red is `1 & 8 = 0`, and the sum with `x` (which is `1`) is `1`.
The bitwise AND of the blue numbers in the case of `[4, 1]` in red is `3 & 8 = 0`, and the sum with `x` (which is `1`) is `1`.
The bitwise AND of the blue numbers in the case of `[4, 8]` in red is `3 & 1 = 1`, and the sum with `x` (which is `1`) is `2`.
The bitwise AND of the blue numbers in the case of `[3, 1]` in red is `4 & 8 = 0`, and the sum with `x` (which is `1`) is `1`.
The bitwise AND of the blue numbers in the case of `[3, 8]` in red is `4 & 1 = 0`, and the sum with `x` (which is `1`) is `1`.
The bitwise AND of the blue numbers in the case of `[1, 8]` in red is `4 & 3 = 0`, and the sum with `x` (which is `1`) is `1`.

For the red numbers `[4, 8]`, the GCD is `4`, and the bitwise AND of the blue numbers is `0 + 1 = 1`. Since `4 > 1`, Kirill should win. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case because it only checks the GCD for the last two elements and the second last two elements without considering all possible combinations of red numbers.

Thus, the program fails to handle all possible cases correctly, making it incorrect.
