The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. For each test case, the function calculates two GCD values (`gcd1` and `gcd2`) and one bitwise AND value (`and1` and `and2`). It then checks if either of these conditions hold true:
1. `gcd1 > and1 + x` for the last two elements of the array.
2. `gcd2 > and2 + x` for the first two elements and the rest of the array.

If either condition is satisfied, the function appends 'YES' along with specific parts of the array to the results list. If neither condition is satisfied, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to standard output in the specified format.
