The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `b`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a[0]` and `b`. After the loop terminates, the function returns a modified version of the list `a` where each element is replaced by its remainder when divided by the GCD of `a[0]` and `b`. However, due to an error in the postcondition annotation, the function incorrectly returns a list where each element is the remainder of the original element divided by 0, which is undefined. The actual functionality is to compute the GCD and then replace each element in `a` with its remainder when divided by the GCD.
