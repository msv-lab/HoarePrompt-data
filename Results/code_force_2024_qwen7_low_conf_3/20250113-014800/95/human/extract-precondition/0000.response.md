Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, and x is an integer. The array a is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and 4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5, 0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5. Each element in a is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5.**
