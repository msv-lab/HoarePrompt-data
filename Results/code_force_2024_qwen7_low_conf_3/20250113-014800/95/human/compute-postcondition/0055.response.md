The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `index` is `8 + 2n + n`, which simplifies to `8 + 3n`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is `8 + 3n`, `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` appended, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true**
