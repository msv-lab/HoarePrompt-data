The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables or the loop is not specified, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t > 0`, `n = data[2]`, `x = data[3]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index = 4 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}', '{} {}'.format(n - 2, ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))]`, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, and `(gcd1 > and1 + x)`**
