`results.append('YES')` appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `results` will contain one element, which is 'YES'. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t > 0`, `n = data[2]`, `x = data[3]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index = 4 + n`, `results` is now `['YES']`, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, and `(gcd1 > and1 + x)`**
