`t` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `t`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (equal to `int(data[index])`), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, `x` is an integer, the array `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, 4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5, 0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5, each element in `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5, `index` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (equal to `int(data[index])`), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, `x` is an integer, the array `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, 4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5, 0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5, each element in `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5, `index` is 1.**
