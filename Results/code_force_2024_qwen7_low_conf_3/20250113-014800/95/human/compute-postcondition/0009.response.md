`index` is incremented by `n`. The value of `index` was previously `4`, so after adding `n`, `index` becomes `4 + n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the value of `data[2]`, `x` is the value of `data[3]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index` is `4 + n`, `results` is an empty list**
