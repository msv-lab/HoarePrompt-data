Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, each integer in `a` is such that `1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5`, `index` is an integer indicating the current position in the `data` list, `results` is a list of strings containing the final results of the loop executions, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for each test case indicated by `t`.
- After processing all test cases, `t` will be reduced to 0.
- For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `a` are determined based on the input data.
- The array `a` is sorted, so its values do not change within a single test case.
- The `index` variable tracks the current position in the `data` list, and it will eventually reach the end of the data list after processing all test cases.
- The `results` list will contain the results of all successful conditions met during the loop execution, followed by a `'NO'` for any test case that did not meet the conditions.

If the loop does not execute due to `t` being 0 initially, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `index`, `results`, `gcd1`, `and1`, `gcd2`, and `and2` will all be their initial values as specified in the initial state.
