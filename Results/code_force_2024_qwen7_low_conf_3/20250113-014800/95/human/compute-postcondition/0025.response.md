The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop present in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t > 0`, `n = data[2]`, `x = data[3]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index = 4 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}', '{} {}'.format(n - 2, ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])), 'YES'), f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])), f'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}']`, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`**
