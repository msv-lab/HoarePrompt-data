Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is the sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `index` is `8 + 3n`; `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` and another `'YES'` appended, and `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'` appended, and `'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}'` appended; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND of all elements in `a[:-2]`; `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]` (updated); `and2` is the result of `a[0] & a[1]`; the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true.***
