The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `x`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, where `4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5`.
- `x` is an integer where `0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5`.

The function processes each test case defined by `t` instances. For each test case, it takes an array `a` of length `n` (where `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order) and an integer `x`. However, the specific operations and return values are not detailed in the provided information.

Given the constraints and without additional details on the operations within the function, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three parameters (`t`, `n`, and `x`) and process each test case defined by these parameters. The exact nature of the processing and the return value are not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `x`. It processes each test case defined by `t` instances, each consisting of an array `a` of length `n` (sorted in non-decreasing order) and an integer `x`.**
