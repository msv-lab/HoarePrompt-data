The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if in a loop) and moves to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided, the `continue` statement does not change any variable values directly. It simply indicates that the loop would continue to its next iteration without executing the remaining part of the current iteration's code.

Given that there is no change in variable values due to the `continue` statement itself, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is the sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `index` is `8 + 3n`; `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` and another `'YES'` appended, and `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'` appended, and `'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}'` appended; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND of all elements in `a[:-2]`; `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]` (updated); `and2` is the result of `a[0] & a[1]`; the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true.**
