The code snippet writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, each element separated by a newline. This operation does not affect any of the variables' values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `index`, `results`, `gcd1`, `and1`, `gcd2`, and `and2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, each integer in `a` is such that `1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5`, `index` is an integer indicating the current position in the `data` list, `results` is a list of strings containing the final results of the loop executions, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`.**
