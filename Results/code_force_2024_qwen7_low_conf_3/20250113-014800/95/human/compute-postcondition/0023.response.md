The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. Specifically, it appends a string that consists of `n - 2` followed by a space and then the elements of `a[2:]` joined by spaces.

Before the code runs, `results` is a list containing four strings. After appending the new string, the length of `results` increases by one. The newly appended string is formatted as follows:
- `n - 2` is a number derived from the initial value of `n`.
- `a[2:]` is a sublist of `a` starting from the third element to the end.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not specified, we can represent the new string as `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`.

The conditions `gcd1 > and1 + x` and `gcd2 > and2 + x` remain unaffected by this line of code, and the variables `gcd1`, `and1`, `gcd2`, and `and2` retain their original values.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t > 0`, `n = data[2]`, `x = data[3]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index = 4 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}', '{} {}'.format(n - 2, ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])), 'YES'), f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))]`, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`.**
