The code appends `'YES'` to the list `results`. The previous state of `results` was a list with an additional `'YES'` and an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` appended. Appending `'YES'` to the list does not change the other elements of `results`, so the updated `results` list is now:

- A list with an additional `'YES'`
- An additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`
- `'NO'`
- Another `'YES'`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is the sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `index` is `8 + 3n`; `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` and another `'YES'` appended; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND of all elements in `a[:-2]`; `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`; `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`; the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true**
