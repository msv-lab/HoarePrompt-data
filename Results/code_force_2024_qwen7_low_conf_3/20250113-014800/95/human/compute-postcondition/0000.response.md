The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `index`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, or the array `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `index` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, `x` is an integer, the array `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, 4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5, 0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5, each element in `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5, `index` is 0.**
