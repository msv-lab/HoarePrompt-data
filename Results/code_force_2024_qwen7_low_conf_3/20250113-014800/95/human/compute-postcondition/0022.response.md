The code appends `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}', '{} {}'.format(n - 2, ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))]`, appending `'YES'` will add another `'YES'` to the end of this list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t > 0`, `n = data[2]`, `x = data[3]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index = 4 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}', '{} {}'.format(n - 2, ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])), 'YES')`, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, the condition `gcd1 > and1 + x` holds true, and the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` also holds true.**
