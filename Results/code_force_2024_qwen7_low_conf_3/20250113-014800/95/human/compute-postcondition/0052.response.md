The code snippet `x = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `x`. The previous value of `x` was the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, but now it is updated to itself again since the value hasn't changed. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `index` is `6 + 2n`; `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` appended; `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`; `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`; `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`; `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`; the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true.**
