The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context given in the initial state, the variables and their values remain unchanged after executing the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is the sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `index` is `8 + 3n`; `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2]))`, and `'NO'` and another `'YES'` appended, and `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'` appended; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND of all elements in `a[:-2]`; `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`; `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`; the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true.**
