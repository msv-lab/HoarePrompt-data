Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. For each test case, the function calculates two GCD values (`gcd1` and `gcd2`) and one bitwise AND value (`and1` and `and2`). It then checks if either of these conditions hold true:
1. `gcd1 > and1 + x` for the last two elements of the array.
2. `gcd2 > and2 + x` for the first two elements and the rest of the array.

If either condition is satisfied, the function appends 'YES' along with specific parts of the array to the results list. If neither condition is satisfied, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to standard output in the specified format.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the array `a` has fewer than 3 elements, the function will not perform the required calculations and will directly append 'NO'.
- If the array `a` has exactly 3 elements, the function will only check the first two elements against the second condition and the last two elements against the first condition.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the array `a` has exactly 2 elements. In such cases, both conditions cannot be checked, and the function should likely append 'NO'.
