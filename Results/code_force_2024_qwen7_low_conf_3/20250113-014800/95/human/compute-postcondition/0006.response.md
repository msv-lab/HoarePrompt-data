The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `x`. Given that `index` is 2, `data[index + 1]` is `data[3]`. Since `n` is the value of `data[2]`, the value of `x` is `data[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the value of `data[2]`, `x` is the value of `data[3]`, `a` must be a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, with each element between 1 and 4 * 10^5, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
