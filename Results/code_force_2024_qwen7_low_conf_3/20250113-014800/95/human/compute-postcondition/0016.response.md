The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. Specifically, it appends the number of elements in `a[:-2]` (which is `n-2`) followed by the elements of `a[:-2]` converted to strings and joined by spaces.

Before the code execution:
- `t > 0`
- `n = data[2]`
- `x = data[3]`
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`
- `index = 4 + n`
- `results` is `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}']`
- `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`
- `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`
- `(gcd1 > and1 + x)`

After the code execution:
- The `results` list will have an additional element: `'{} {}'.format(n - 2, ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t > 0`, `n = data[2]`, `x = data[3]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index = 4 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}', '{} {}'.format(n - 2, ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))]`, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, and `(gcd1 > and1 + x)`**
