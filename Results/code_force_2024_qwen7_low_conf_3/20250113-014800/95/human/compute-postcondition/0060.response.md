The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. Specifically, it appends the string `f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'`. Given the precondition, `a` is a sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, and `a[-1]` is the last element of this list while `a[-2]` is the second last element.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the `results` list, which now includes the new string.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is the sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `index` is `8 + 3n`; `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` and another `'YES'` appended, and `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'` appended; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND of all elements in `a[:-2]`; `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`; `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`; the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true.**
