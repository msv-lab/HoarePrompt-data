The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. This operation modifies the `results` list by adding one more element. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial conditions and the operation performed, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is the sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `index` is `8 + 3n`; `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2]))`, and `'NO'` and another `'YES'` appended, and `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'` appended; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND of all elements in `a[:-2]`; `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]` (updated); `and2` is the result of `a[0] & a[1]`; the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true; `results` has an additional `'YES'` appended.**
