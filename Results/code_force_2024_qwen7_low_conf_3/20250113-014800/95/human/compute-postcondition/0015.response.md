The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. The string added is `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `index`, `gcd1`, `and1`, or their relationships.

- `results` was initially `['YES']`.
- After appending the new string, `results` becomes `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}']`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t > 0`, `n = data[2]`, `x = data[3]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index = 4 + n`, `results` is now `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}']`, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, and `(gcd1 > and1 + x)`**.
