The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given the initial state where `index` is 2, after executing this line of code, `index` will be 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the value of `data[2]`, `x` is the value of `data[3]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, with each element between 1 and 4 * 10^5, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list**
