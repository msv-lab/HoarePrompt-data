The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, or `index`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (equal to `int(data[index])`), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, `x` is an integer, the array `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, 4 <= n <= 4 * 10^5, 0 <= x <= 4 * 10^5, each element in `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 4 * 10^5, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**
