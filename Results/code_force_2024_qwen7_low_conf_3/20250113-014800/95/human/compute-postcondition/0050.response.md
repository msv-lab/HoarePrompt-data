Let's break down the state and how it changes for each iteration of the loop.

### Given State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This means `t` was decremented in the previous iteration.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `index` is `6 + 2n`.
- `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` appended.
- `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`.
- `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`.
- `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`.
- `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
- The condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true.
- `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusted States for Next Iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0 because the loop runs `t` times.
- `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration since the problem doesn't suggest any change in `n`.
- `x` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `a` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `index` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `results` should now include an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` appended, similar to the previous iteration.
- `gcd1` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `and1` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `gcd2` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `and2` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- The condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` must still hold true.

### Final State for Next Iteration:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is `6 + 2n`, `results` is a list with an additional `'YES'`, an additional element `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'NO'` appended, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, and the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true.**
