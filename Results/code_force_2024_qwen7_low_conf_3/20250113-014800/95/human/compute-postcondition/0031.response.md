The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `index` was originally `4 + n`. After incrementing by 2, the new value of `index` becomes `(4 + n) + 2 = 6 + n`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[4:4+n]`, `index` is `6 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}', '{} {}'.format(n - 2, ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])),'YES'), f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])), f'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}', 'NO']`, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of the elements in `a[:-2]`, `gcd2` is the GCD of `a[2:]`, `and2` is the bitwise AND of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, and the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` still holds true.**
