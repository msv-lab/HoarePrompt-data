You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        a = (*map(int, s.split()),)
        u = sum(a) // len(a)
        d = f = 0
        for x in a:
            d += x - u
            f |= d
        print('YNEOS'[f < 0::2])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that their sum is divisible by \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the average \( u \) and then computes the differences between each \( a_i \) and \( u \). It accumulates these differences into \( d \) and uses a bitwise OR operation to accumulate the result into \( f \). Finally, it prints 'Y' if \( f \) is less than 0 for any test case, otherwise it prints 'N'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to determine if we can make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations.
2. The key observation is that the total amount of water is always divisible by the number of containers \(n\), meaning the target amount of water per container would be \( \frac{\text{sum}(a)}{n} \).
3. The program iterates through each test case, calculates the target amount of water per container, and then checks if the water distribution allows for such an equal distribution.
4. For each test case, the program:
   - Reads the number of containers and their respective water amounts.
   - Computes the target amount of water per container.
   - Initializes `d` to track the difference between the current total water and the target total water.
   - Uses a bitmask `f` to check if the difference `d` ever becomes negative. If `d` ever goes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water amounts using the given operations.
5. The condition `print('YNEOS'[f < 0::2])` prints "YES" if `f` is non-negative (meaning `d` never went negative), indicating the water can be evenly distributed, otherwise it prints "NO".
6. Given the constraints and logic, the program correctly implements the solution as required by the problem statement.
