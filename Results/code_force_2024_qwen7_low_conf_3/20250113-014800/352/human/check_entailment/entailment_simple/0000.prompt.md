You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        a = *map(int, s.split()),
        
        u = sum(a) // len(a)
        
        d = f = 0
        
        for x in a:
            d += x - u
            f |= d
        
        print('YNEOS'[f < 0::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have completed.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis
    #
    #1. **Initialization**:
    #   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
    #   - For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
    #   - The second line of input contains `n` non-negative integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that the sum of \(a_i\) is divisible by \(n\).
    #   - The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
    #
    #2. **First Loop**:
    #   - The outer loop iterates over lines of input starting from the third line (`[*open(0)][2::2]`), where each line represents a test case.
    #   - Inside this loop, `a` is initialized as a tuple of integers from the split and mapped input line.
    #   - `u` is calculated as the sum of `a` divided by the length of `a`.
    #   - `d` and `f` are initialized to 0.
    #   - The inner loop iterates over each element `x` in `a`:
    #     - `d` is updated by adding the difference between `x` and `u`.
    #     - `f` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `d`.
    #   - After processing all elements in `a`, the condition `f < 0` is checked, and based on the result, either `'YNOE'`[0] (which is `'Y'`) or `'NOE'`[1] (which is `'N'`) is printed, followed by `S` or `O`.
    #
    #3. **Behavior of Variables**:
    #   - `t` remains constant as it is an input parameter.
    #   - `n` remains constant within the context of each test case.
    #   - `a` is redefined for each test case.
    #   - `u`, `d`, and `f` are redefined for each test case.
    #   - The final output is determined by the condition `f < 0` after processing all elements in `a`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #- After processing all test cases, the final output is determined by whether `f` is less than 0 or not.
    #- Since the loop iterates over all test cases, and the condition `f < 0` is checked for each, the final output will be based on the combined result of all `f` values across all test cases.
    #- The condition `f < 0` will be evaluated to determine the final output.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #
    #The final output state after all iterations of the loop will be based on the condition `f < 0` for each test case. If `f` is less than 0 for any test case, the output will be `'YNOE'`[0] (which is `'Y'`). Otherwise, the output will be `'NOE'`[1] (which is `'N'`).
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #**Output State: `Y` if `f < 0` for any test case, otherwise `N`.**

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
