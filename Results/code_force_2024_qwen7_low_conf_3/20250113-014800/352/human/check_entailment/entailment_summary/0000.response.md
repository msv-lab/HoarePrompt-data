Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The key observation here is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers \(n\), then each container should end up with exactly \(u = \frac{\text{total amount of water}}{n}\) units of water to ensure all containers have the same amount.
3. The program calculates \(u\) as the average amount of water per container.
4. It then checks the cumulative difference between each container's water amount and \(u\). Specifically, it calculates the cumulative difference `d` and uses a bitwise OR operation (`f |= d`) to accumulate the sign of `d`.
5. If at any point `d` becomes negative, `f` will become negative due to the OR operation. This indicates that it's not possible to balance the containers because the cumulative deficit would never be balanced out by a surplus.
6. The program correctly prints 'YES' if the cumulative differences can be balanced (i.e., `f` remains non-negative) and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the logic and the steps in the program align with the requirement to check if it's possible to equalize the water distribution, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
