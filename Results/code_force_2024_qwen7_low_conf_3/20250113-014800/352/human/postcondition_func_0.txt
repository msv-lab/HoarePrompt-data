The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that their sum is divisible by \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the average \( u \) and then computes the differences between each \( a_i \) and \( u \). It accumulates these differences into \( d \) and uses a bitwise OR operation to accumulate the result into \( f \). Finally, it prints 'Y' if \( f \) is less than 0 for any test case, otherwise it prints 'N'.
