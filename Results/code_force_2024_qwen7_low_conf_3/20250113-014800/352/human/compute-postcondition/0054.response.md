`sum1` is assigned the value of `sum1 + arr[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[0]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0; `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0; `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[0]`**
