The code snippet `print('yes')` does not affect any of the variables or their values. It only prints the string 'yes' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // 2`, `sum1` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `arr`, `sum2` is the sum of the remaining elements of `arr`, and the following conditions hold: `sum1 > sum2`, `arr[0] > sm3`, and `arr[n - 1] <= sm3`. The string 'yes' is printed to the console.**
