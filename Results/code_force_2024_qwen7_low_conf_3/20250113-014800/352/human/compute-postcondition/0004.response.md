To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the structure of the loop:

1. **Variables and their constraints:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`.
   - Each line processed by the loop contains \(n + 1\) values where the first value is `n` and the remaining values are non-negative integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that their sum is divisible by `n`.
   - `u` is the integer division of the sum of all elements in the list `a` by the length of `a`.
   - `d` is 0.
   - `f` is 0.

2. **Loop structure:**
   ```python
   for x in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty.

3. **State adjustment:**
   - The state before the loop should include the condition that the list `a` is not empty. Since `a` is a list obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`, we need to ensure that `s` results in a non-empty list.

Thus, the state adjustments needed are:
- `a` must be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `u` is the integer division of the sum of all elements in the list `a` by the length of `a`, `d` is 0, `f` is 0**.
