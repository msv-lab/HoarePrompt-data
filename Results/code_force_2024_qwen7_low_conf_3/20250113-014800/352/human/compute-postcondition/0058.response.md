`sum1` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `sum1` was previously updated to include `arr[0] + arr[1]`. So, the new value of `sum1` will be the sum of its previous value plus `arr[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[3]`**
