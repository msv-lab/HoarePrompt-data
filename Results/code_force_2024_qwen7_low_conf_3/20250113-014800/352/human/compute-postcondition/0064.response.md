Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than -1, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // 2`, `sum1` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `arr`. If `sum1 > sum2` and `arr[0] > sm3` and `arr[n - 1] <= sm3`, the string 'yes' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'no' is printed to the console.***
