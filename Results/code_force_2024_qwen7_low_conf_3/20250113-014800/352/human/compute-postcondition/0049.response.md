The code `sm3 = sum(arr) // n` updates the value of `sm3` to be the integer division of the sum of the list `arr` by the integer `n`. Given the initial state where `t` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is the sum of `arr` divided by 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, and `arr` is updated to a list of integers from the input string, the only change is to `sm3`.

Since `sm3` is now equal to `sum(arr) // n`, and the values of `arr` and `n` are unchanged from their initial state, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is the sum of `arr` divided by 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is updated to a list of integers from the input string; `sm3` is updated to `sum(arr) // n`**.
