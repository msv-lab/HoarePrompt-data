The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it appears to process a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function is expected to perform some operation on these inputs, but the specific operation is not detailed in the given information.

Given the constraints, the function processes multiple test cases, with each test case having its own `n` and the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The sum of `a_i` for each test case is guaranteed to be divisible by `n` and does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^9\).

Since the specific operation is not detailed, the function's return value is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `n` and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns unspecified results based on the input arrays and integers.**
