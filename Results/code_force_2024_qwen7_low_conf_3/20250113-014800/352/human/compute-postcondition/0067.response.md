Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). The function calculates the sum of the first \( \frac{n}{2} \) elements of the array (`sum1`), the total sum of the array divided by 2 (`sum2`), and the average of the array (`sm3`). Based on these calculations and specific conditions, the function prints either "yes" or "no" for each test case. Specifically, it prints "yes" if the following conditions are met: `sum1 > sum2`, the first element of the array (`arr[0]`) is greater than `sm3`, and the last element of the array (`arr[n - 1]`) is less than or equal to `sm3`. If any test case does not meet these conditions, "no" is printed. The function also handles edge cases where \( n = 1 \) or the total sum of the array is zero, in which case it directly prints "yes".**
