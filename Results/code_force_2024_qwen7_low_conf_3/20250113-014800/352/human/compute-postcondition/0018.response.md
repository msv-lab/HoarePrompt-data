`d` is assigned the value `0`, and `f` is also assigned the value `0`. The values of `a` and `u` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `f` is 0 (since `f = 0`), `d` is 0, `a` is a tuple of integers obtained by splitting `s` by spaces and converting each substring to an integer, `u` is the sum of the elements in `a` divided by the length of `a`.

Output State: **`f` is 0, `d` is 0, `a` is a tuple of integers obtained by splitting `s` by spaces and converting each substring to an integer, `u` is the sum of the elements in `a` divided by the length of `a`.**
