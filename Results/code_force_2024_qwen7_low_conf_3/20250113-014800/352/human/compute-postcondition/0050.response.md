The code simply prints 'yes', which does not affect the values of any variables. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `sum1`, `sum2`, and `sm3` retain their original values from the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is the sum of `arr` divided by 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, no change in the values of these variables, print statement 'yes' executed.**
