The code updates the value of `sum2` to the sum of the list `arr` divided by 2. Initially, `sum2` was calculated as the sum of `arr` divided by 2, but now it is recalculated based on the current values in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `sum2` is initially set to `sum(arr) // 2`, after running the code, `sum2` will still be `sum(arr) // 2` because the list `arr` is not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `sum2` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is the sum of `arr` divided by 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is updated to a list of integers from the input string.**
