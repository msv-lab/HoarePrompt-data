The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the initial conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is the sum of `arr` divided by 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, no change in the values of these variables, print statement 'yes' executed.**
