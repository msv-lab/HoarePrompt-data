`sum1` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is initially 1, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[1]`. However, the value of `arr[1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `sum1`. But we know that `sum1` was initially updated to `sum1 + arr[0]`, and now it is updated again by adding `arr[1]`.

The output state is: `t` is greater than -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2 (since `i` is incremented), `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[0] + arr[1]`.
Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[0] + arr[1]`**
