The code assigns `0` to both `d` and `f`. This affects the values of these variables directly. The values of `s`, `a`, and `u` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`f` is 0, `d` is 0, `s` is the fifth element of the list, `a` is a tuple containing the integer value of `s`, `u` is equal to the value of `s`.**
