Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is the sum of `arr` divided by 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`. If `n == 1` or `sum(arr) == 0`, no change in the values of these variables and a 'yes' print statement is executed. Otherwise, no changes occur in these variables.***
