Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `f` is \((\text{second\_element\_of\_a} - s) | (\text{second\_element\_of\_a} + x - 2 \cdot s)\)
- `d` is \(\text{second\_element\_of\_a} + x - 2 \cdot s\)
- `s` is the fifth element of the list
- `a` is a non-empty tuple containing the second element of the original tuple `a` as `x`
- `u` is equal to the value of `s`

### For Loop Statement
```python
for x in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element in the tuple `a`.
- Initially, `x` was set to the second element of the original tuple `a`.
- Each iteration of the loop changes the value of `x` to the next element in the tuple `a`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Identify the current value of `x`:**
   - Initially, `x` was set to the second element of the original tuple `a`.
   - After the first iteration, `x` would have changed to the next element in the tuple `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `a`, the next value of `x` will be the next element in the tuple `a`.
   - The values of `f`, `d`, `s`, and `u` remain unchanged because they depend on the initial conditions and the structure of the loop.

### New State
- `f` remains the same: \((\text{second\_element\_of\_a} - s) | (\text{second\_element\_of\_a} + x - 2 \cdot s)\)
- `d` remains the same: \(\text{second\_element\_of\_a} + x - 2 \cdot s\)
- `s` remains the same: the fifth element of the list
- `u` remains the same: equal to the value of `s`
- `x` will be the next element in the tuple `a`

### Final Answer
State: **`f` is \((\text{second\_element\_of\_a} - s) | (\text{second\_element\_of\_a} + x - 2 \cdot s)\), `d` is \(\text{second\_element\_of\_a} + x - 2 \cdot s\), `s` is the fifth element of the list, `u` is equal to the value of `s`, and `x` is the next element in the tuple `a`**
