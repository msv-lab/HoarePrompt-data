Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input string, `sum1` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `arr`, `sum2` is the sum of `arr` divided by 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`. If the loop completes all iterations (i.e., for each test case `t`), and for every test case, if `sum1 > sum2` and `arr[0] > sm3` and `arr[n - 1] <= sm3`, the string 'yes' is printed for that test case. Otherwise, the string 'no' is printed for that test case.**
