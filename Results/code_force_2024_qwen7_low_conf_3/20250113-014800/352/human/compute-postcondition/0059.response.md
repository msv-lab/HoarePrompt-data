Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // 2`, `sum1` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `arr`**.

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `n // 2` iterations, updating `sum1` by adding the corresponding elements from the list `arr`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n // 2`.
- `sum1` will be the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `arr`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` do not change unless `n == 1` or `sum(arr) == 0`, in which case the values remain unchanged and a 'yes' print statement is executed.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n <= 0`), then `i` remains 0, and `sum1` remains 0, while `t` and `n` retain their original values, and `arr` remains unchanged.
