According to the code, the loop condition is based on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `t` is greater than -1 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition).
- `n` must be greater than 0 (this is a requirement for the loop to run at all).
- `i` is 2.
- `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[0] + arr[1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2`. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n // 2` must be greater than 2. This means `n` must be at least 5 (since `5 // 2 = 2` and `6 // 2 = 3`, etc.).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[0] + arr[1]`**
