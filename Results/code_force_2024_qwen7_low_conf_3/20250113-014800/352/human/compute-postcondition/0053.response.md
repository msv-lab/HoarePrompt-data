To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than -1
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input string
- `sum1` is 0
- `sum2` is the sum of `arr` divided by 2
- `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`

The loop condition is `for i in range(n // 2):`. For this loop to execute, the following must be true:
1. `n` must be greater than 0 (since `n // 2` should evaluate to a positive integer).
2. The loop will iterate for `n // 2` times, starting with `i = 0` and ending when `i < n // 2`.

Given these conditions, let's adjust the states:

1. `t > -1`: This is already given and does not affect the loop execution.
2. `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
3. `i` must start as 0 and increment within each iteration.
4. The loop will run until `i < n // 2`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `n` is greater than 0.
- Set `i` to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is greater than -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
