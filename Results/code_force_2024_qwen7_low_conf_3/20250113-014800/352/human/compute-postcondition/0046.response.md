The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to process input data that is not provided as function arguments but rather through standard input or another external source. The function must read an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that their sum is divisible by `n`. The function's output is not specified directly in the given information, but based on the constraints, it must process each test case according to the described input format.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read a series of test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that their sum is divisible by `n`, and for each test case, perform the necessary operations based on these inputs.
