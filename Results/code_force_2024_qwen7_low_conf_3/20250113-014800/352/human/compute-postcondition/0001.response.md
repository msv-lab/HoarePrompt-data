The code `a = *map(int, s.split()),` splits the string `s` into individual elements, converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)` and unpacks the result into the variable `a`. The initial state includes that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). Each line processed by the loop contains \(n + 1\) values where the first value is `n` and the remaining values are non-negative integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that their sum is divisible by `n`.

After executing `a = *map(int, s.split()),`, the variable `a` is now a list containing the integers from the string `s`. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`; each line processed by the loop contains \(n + 1\) values where the first value is `n` and the remaining values are non-negative integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that their sum is divisible by `n`.**
