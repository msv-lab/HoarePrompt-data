The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we are currently inside. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is `user_input`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is 1, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
