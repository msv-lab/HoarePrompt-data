The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string into an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. 

- `user_input` is the integer value entered by the user, so it remains unchanged.
- `n` is set to `user_input`, so it also remains unchanged.
- `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the user's input.

Since the user's input is not specified, let's denote the input as `x1 x2 x3 ... xn`, where `x1, x2, x3, ..., xn` are integers. After executing the code, `a` will be a list containing these integers.

Output State: **`user_input` is the integer value entered by the user, `n` is `user_input`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input**.
