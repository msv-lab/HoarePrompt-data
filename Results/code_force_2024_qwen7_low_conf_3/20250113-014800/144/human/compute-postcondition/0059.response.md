Postcondition: ***`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input. If `a[a[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no additional change in other variables since the else part is not provided.***
