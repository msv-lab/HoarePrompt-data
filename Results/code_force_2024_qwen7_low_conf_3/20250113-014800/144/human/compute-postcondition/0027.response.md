`z` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `user_input`, `n`, `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the new integer input from the user, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is 0, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
