Postcondition: ***`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is `user_input`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is 1, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`. If `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables' states.***
