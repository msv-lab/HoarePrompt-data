`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. This means `n` now holds the value entered by the user, which was previously stored in `user_input`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is 1 if the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true for any index `i` in the range [0, n-1], otherwise `z` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `t` is greater than 1.**
