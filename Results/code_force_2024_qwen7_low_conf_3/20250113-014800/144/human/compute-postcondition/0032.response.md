Postcondition: ***`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is 1, `t` is greater than 0. If the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true for some index `i`, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as initially described.***
