The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it simply breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case statement. Since there is no loop or switch-case in the given code snippet, it means that the `break` statement will cause an exit from the context it was originally placed in (which is not specified here). However, based on the provided information, no loops or switch-case statements are active.

The states of the variables remain unchanged:
- `user_input` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0
- `z` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `t` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, and the current value of `a[a[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, and the current value of `a[a[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`**
