The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match case. Since there is no loop or match case in the given context, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is now `n + 1`, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `z` is 1, and `t` remains greater than 0.**
