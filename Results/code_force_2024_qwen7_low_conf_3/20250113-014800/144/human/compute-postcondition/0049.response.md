The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and converts them into a list of integers. This affects the variable `a`. The other variables (`user_input`, `n`, `z`, `i`, `t`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Since the initial state of `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, after executing the code, `a` will now hold the list of integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `z` is 1 if the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true for any index `i` in the range [0, n-1], otherwise `z` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `t` is greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the user's input.**
