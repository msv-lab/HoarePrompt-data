The `break` statement does not modify any variable values; instead, it breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context (which could be a loop or conditional block). However, since no specific context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the nearest enclosing structure.

The values of the variables `user_input`, `n`, `a`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state includes all these variables with their original values.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is `user_input`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is 1, and `i` is `previous_i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
