Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `user_input` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(n):
    if a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1:
        z = 1
        break
```

### Analysis

1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is set to 1 and the loop breaks.

2. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - **Case 1:** If the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true for any `i` within the range, the loop will set `z` to 1 and break.
   - **Case 2:** If the condition is false for all `i` within the range, the loop will not break and will complete all `n` iterations.

### Final States

- **Case 1 (Condition True for Some `i`):**
  - After the loop completes, `z` will be 1.
  - The value of `i` will be the last `i` where the condition was true, or it could be the last possible value of `i` if the condition was never true.
  - The value of `t` remains unchanged, i.e., `t > 1`.

- **Case 2 (Condition False for All `i`):**
  - After the loop completes, `z` will still be 0.
  - The value of `i` will be `n - 1` (the last possible value of `i`).
  - The value of `t` remains unchanged, i.e., `t > 1`.

### Conclusion

- Regardless of whether the condition is true or false, the final value of `i` will always be `n - 1`.
- `t` remains unchanged, i.e., `t > 1`.

### Output State

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input.**
