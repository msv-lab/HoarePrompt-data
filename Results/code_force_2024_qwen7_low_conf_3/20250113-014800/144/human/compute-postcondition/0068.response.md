The code `print(2)` simply prints the number 2 to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, and `z` is 1**
