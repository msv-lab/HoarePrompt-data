`z` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`user_input`, `n`, and `a`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `user_input` is the integer value entered by the user, `n` is `user_input`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is `0`.

Output State: **`user_input` is the integer value entered by the user, `n` is `user_input`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is `0`**
