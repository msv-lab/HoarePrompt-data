`z` is assigned the value 1. This changes the value of `z` from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is `user_input`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is 1, and for the current index `i`, the element `a[i]` minus 1 is an index in the list `a` where the value at that index is equal to `i + 1`.**
