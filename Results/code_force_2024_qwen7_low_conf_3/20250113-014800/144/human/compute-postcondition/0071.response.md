The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will work with predefined or global variables `t`, `n`, and `p` that are constrained as follows: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. 

The function has two cases for its output:
- Case_1: `number` is an integer, and if `number` is less than 0, the function returns an error message indicating that ages can't be negative.
- Case_2: `number` is an integer, and if `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".

However, since the function does not directly accept any parameters and the output conditions do not align with the given constraints and relationships, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misalignment in the provided information.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function's behavior should be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts predefined or global variables `t`, `n`, and `p`, and based on certain conditions, returns either an error message or a string indicating whether a person is "minor" or "adult".**
