According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `z` is 1, and `t` remains greater than 0. 

Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` should be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.

State: **`i` is now `n + 1`, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `z` is 1, and `t` remains greater than 0.**

This ensures that `i` is less than `n` for the next iteration.
