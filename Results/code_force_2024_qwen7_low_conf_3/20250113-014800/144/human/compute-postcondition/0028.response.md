Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is iterating over `range(n)`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial states:
- `user_input` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is the new integer input from the user.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input.
- `z` is 0.
- `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The final state should reflect this requirement:

State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `z` is 0, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0**
