`z` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, and the current value of `a[a[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, and the current value of `a[a[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, and the current value of `a[a[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`**
