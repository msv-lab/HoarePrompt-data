The line `z = 1` does not change the value of `z`, as it is already set to 1 in the initial state. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, and the current value of `a[a[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`**
