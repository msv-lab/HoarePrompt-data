The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact input is not specified, we will denote the input as `user_input`.

Output State: **`user_input` is the integer value entered by the user, `n` is `user_input`, and other variables are unchanged.**
