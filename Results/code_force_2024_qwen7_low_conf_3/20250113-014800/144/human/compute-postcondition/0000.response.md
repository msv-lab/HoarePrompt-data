`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The values of `n` and `p` remain as defined in the initial state, as no input is provided for them yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct; `t` is now an input integer**
