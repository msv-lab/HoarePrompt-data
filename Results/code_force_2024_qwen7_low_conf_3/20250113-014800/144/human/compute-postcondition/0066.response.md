The code `print(3)` simply prints the number 3 to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is that the number 3 is printed.

Output State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, the number 3 is printed to the console.**
