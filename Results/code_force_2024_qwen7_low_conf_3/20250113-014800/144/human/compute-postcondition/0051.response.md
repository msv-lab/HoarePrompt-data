According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts within the range defined by `n`.

Given the initial states:
- `user_input` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is the input integer
- `z` is 0
- `i` is `n`
- `t` is greater than 1
- `a` is the list of integers obtained from the user's input

We need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically:
- `i` must be within the range of `range(n)`, which means `i` should start from 0 up to `n-1`.
- `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the range is valid and the loop can start.

Since `i` is initially set to `n`, we need to ensure `i` is adjusted to a value within the range `[0, n-1]`. Typically, the loop starts with `i=0` and increments until `i=n`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 0 and ensure `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the user's input**
