Postcondition: ***`user_input` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, and the current value of `a[a[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`***

Explanation: Since the `else` part is not provided and the `if` part does not change any variable values, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. The variables `user_input`, `n`, `z`, `i`, `t`, and `a` retain their initial states described in the precondition.
