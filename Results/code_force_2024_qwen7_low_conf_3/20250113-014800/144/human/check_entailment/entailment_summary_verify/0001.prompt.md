You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        z = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                z = 1
                break
        if z == 0:
            print(3)
        else:
            print(2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n`. It then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index exists, the function prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function iterates through all test cases provided in `t`. After completing the processing of all test cases, the function does not return anything explicitly (it only prints the results during execution). Potential edge cases include invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values for `t` or `n`, or values outside the specified ranges), but the provided code handles these by using `int(input())` which will raise a `ValueError` for non-integer inputs. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the results accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `a`.
   - It then checks if there exists a pair of friends `(i, a[i])` such that `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`. This means that both friends are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair exists, it prints `2`, meaning only two invitations need to be sent.
   - Otherwise, it prints `3`.

However, this logic does not guarantee that at least 2 friends will come to the party. Let's consider some edge cases:

- In the example provided in the problem statement, when `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`, sending invitations to friends `[1, 2, 4, 5]` makes friends `[2, 4, 5]` come. But the program incorrectly prints `2` for this case because it finds a pair `(1, 3)` where `a[a[1]-1] == 1+1` (since `a[3-1] == 2`), leading to the output `2`.

Another issue is with the case where `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]`. According to the logic, the program would print `3` (which is incorrect), but logically, inviting both friends should suffice.

Thus, the program does not handle all scenarios correctly, and the logic is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
