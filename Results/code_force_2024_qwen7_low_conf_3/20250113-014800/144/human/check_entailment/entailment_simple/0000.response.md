Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to calculate the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party. Instead, it checks whether there exists a pair of friends who are each others' best friends and prints 2 if such a pair exists, or 3 if no such pair exists. This logic does not guarantee that the minimum number of invitations is sent to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

To illustrate with examples:

### Example 1:
Given input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

Expected output (based on the problem description):
```
2
3
2
```

However, the current program produces:
```
2
3
2
```

This seems to be correct for the given examples, but let's consider a more complex case to see the flaw.

### Example 2:
Given input:
```
3
5
5 4 3 2 1
```

Expected output (based on the problem description):
```
3
```

But the current program would incorrectly output:
```
2
```

This is because the program checks for the existence of a pair of friends who are each others' best friends and prints 2 if such a pair exists. In this case, there is no such pair, so it prints 3, which is incorrect. The program needs to find the minimum number of invitations required, not just check for the presence of a pair.

### Why the program is incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
2. **Lack of Detailed Calculation**: The program does not account for scenarios where multiple friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend, especially in cases where no direct pair of best friends exists.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Identify all friends who can potentially bring another friend to the party.
2. Use a strategy to minimize the number of invitations while ensuring at least 2 friends attend the party.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus **False**.
