Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends (`n`) and their corresponding best friend indices stored in the list `a`.
   - It then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`. This condition implies that `i` and `a[i]` are best friends who can both attend the party with a single invitation.
   - If such a pair is found, it means at least 2 friends can be invited with just 2 invitations, hence the output is `2`.
   - If no such pair exists, it means no pair of best friends can be invited together, and thus at least 3 separate invitations are needed to invite any friends, making the output `3`.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: 
   - The program handles edge cases well by ensuring that `t` and `n` are integers within the specified ranges. Any non-integer inputs would cause an error due to the use of `int()`.
   - The program also correctly handles the constraint that all `p_i` are distinct and none equal to `i`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the above points, the program accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to attend the party, based on the provided constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
