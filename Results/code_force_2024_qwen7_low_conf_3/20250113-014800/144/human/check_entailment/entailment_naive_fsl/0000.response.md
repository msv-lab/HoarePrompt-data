Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there is no pair of friends who are each other's best friends. Specifically, consider the input:

```
2
2
2 1
```

In this case, neither friend 1 nor friend 2 will come to the party because their best friends (each other) did not receive invitations. According to the problem description, Monocarp needs to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. The current implementation always prints 2 or 3 without checking if it's possible to have at least 2 friends attending, which fails in this specific scenario. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
