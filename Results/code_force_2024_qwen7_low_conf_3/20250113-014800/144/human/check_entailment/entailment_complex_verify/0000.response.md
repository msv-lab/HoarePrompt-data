### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Monocarp wants to throw a party with at least 2 friends.
- Each friend \(i\) has a best friend \(p_i\).
- A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive invitations.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

#### Code Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of friends \(n\) and a list \(a\) representing each friend's best friend.
- It then checks if there exists any friend \(i\) such that the best friend of \(a[i]\)'s best friend is \(i\). If such a pair exists, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.

#### Detailed Walkthrough:
1. **Case with Valid Pairs:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     2
     3 1 2 5 4
     ```
   - The code correctly identifies that friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends and thus both will come to the party if invited.
   - The output is 2, which is correct.

2. **Case with No Valid Pairs:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     2
     2 1
     ```
   - Here, there are no pairs such that a friend and their best friend are each other's best friends.
   - The code correctly prints 3, indicating that it is impossible to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The code uses `int(input())` to read integers, which inherently handles non-integer inputs by raising a `ValueError`.
   - For the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct), the code should work as expected.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment that the program is incorrect due to failing to check if at least 2 friends can attend is not accurate. The provided code correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
