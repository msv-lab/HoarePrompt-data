t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in the corresponding cell of the grid; there are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
