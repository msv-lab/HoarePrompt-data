The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `grid`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive even integer representing the number of columns in the grid, and `grid` is a list containing two strings of length `n`, where each string consists of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively. For each test case, the function reads `t` test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `grid`. It then calls `func_1(n, grid)` to check if a certain condition is met. If `func_1(n, grid)` returns `True` for any test case, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return anything explicitly but relies on the output printed during its execution.
