The code `print('No')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the string 'No' to the console. Therefore, the only change is the output of the program, but the variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, the program prints 'No'**
