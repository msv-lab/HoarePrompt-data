Postcondition: ***`queue` does not contain the tuple \((nx, ny)\) that was removed; `x` is the first element of the removed tuple; `y` is the second element of the removed tuple; `visited[x][y]` is `True`. If \(x = 1\) and \(y = n - 1\), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns the same as the initial state (i.e., it does not return anything new).***
