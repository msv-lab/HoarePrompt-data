Postcondition: ***`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true. Moreover, the direction of movement is either right (`dx == 1` and `dy == 0`) or left (`dx == -1` and `dy == 0`), but `grid[nx][ny] != '>'`.***
