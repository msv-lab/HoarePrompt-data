Let's analyze the given scenario step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(n \geq 3\).
   - `i` is `n - 1` (if the loop did not break).
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates `t` times.
   - For each iteration, it checks the condition: `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'Yes'.

4. **State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating `t` times and we are considering the start of the next iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 from its initial value.
   - Therefore, `t` becomes `t - 1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged as well because the loop is simply decrementing `t` and does not modify `i` unless the condition breaks the loop.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - `t` is reduced by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(n \geq 3\), `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and \(t\) is reduced by 1**.
