Postcondition: ***`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged. If `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` and `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`, then the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` still hold true, and `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True`. The queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` if `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`. Otherwise, if `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. If `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. In all other cases, no changes occur.***
