Postcondition: ***`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; the current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`. If `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>'` and `dy` is `1`, then `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, if `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))` is false, `(nx, ny)` is still added to `queue`.***
