According to the given for loop, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 4
- `i` is 3

The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration (since the step is 2 in `range(1, n, 2)`), so the next value of `i` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be 5 and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5**
