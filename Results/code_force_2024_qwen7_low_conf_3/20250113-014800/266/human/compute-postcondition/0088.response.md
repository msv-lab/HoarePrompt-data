The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` updates the value of `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This means that the current cell `(nx, ny)` is marked as visited.

The states of the other variables (`nx`, `ny`, `visited`, and the queue) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` if the condition for appending was met.**
