`visited[nx][ny]` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `visited[nx][ny]`, and the queue are updated accordingly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` if the condition for appending was met.**
