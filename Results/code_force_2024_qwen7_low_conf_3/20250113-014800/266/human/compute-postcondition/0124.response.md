The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. This operation does not affect the values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `visited[nx][ny]`, or the content of `queue` except for adding the new tuple.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`. The queue now contains an additional tuple `(nx, ny)`.**
