Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \(t\) (such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), an integer \(n\) (such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n\) is even), and two strings \(a\) and \(b\) of length \(n\) where each character is either "<" or ">". For each test case, the function checks if there exists any index \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n-1\) and \(i\) is odd) such that \(a[i] = '<'\) and either \(b[i+1] = '<'\) or \(b[i-1] = '<'\). If such an index is found, the function prints 'No' and terminates the current test case. If no such index is found for any test case, the function prints 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where the strings contain characters other than "<" or ">".**
