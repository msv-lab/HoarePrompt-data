Postcondition: ***`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; the current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`. If `grid[nx][ny]` is `'<'` and `dy` is `-1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue` regardless of the value of `grid[nx][ny]` or the value of `dy`.***
