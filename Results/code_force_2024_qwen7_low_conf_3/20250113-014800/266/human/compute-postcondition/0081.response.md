`queue` is appended with the tuple `(nx, ny)`. This means that the tuple `(nx, ny)` is added to the queue. The values of the other variables (`nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `visited[nx][ny]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` and the new tuple `(nx, ny)` has been appended.**
