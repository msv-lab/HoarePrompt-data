The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` to be `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. This does not affect the values of `dx`, `dy`, or `visited`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are checked against the conditions specified, but since the actual values of `dx`, `dy`, `x`, `y`, and `grid[nx][ny]` are not provided, we cannot determine if the additional conditions (`grid[nx][ny]` being `'<'` and `dy` being `-1`) are met. However, in both cases (whether the conditions are met or not), `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True` and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.**
