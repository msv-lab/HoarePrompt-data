The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns the value of `x + dx` to `nx` and the value of `y + dy` to `ny`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

- `dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list.
- `nx` is now `x + dx`.
- `ny` is now `y + dy`.
- `visited[nx][ny]` is still `True`.
- `(nx, ny)` is still added to `queue`.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.**
