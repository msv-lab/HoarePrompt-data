Postcondition: ***`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`. The queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, the new tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to the queue. If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, the queue does not change. Otherwise, the new tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to the queue.***
