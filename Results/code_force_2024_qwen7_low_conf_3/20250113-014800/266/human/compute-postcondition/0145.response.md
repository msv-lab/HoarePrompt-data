Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the last pair from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the additional element `(nx, ny)`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, no additional elements are added to `queue`. Otherwise, if `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `queue` contains one additional element `(nx, ny)`. The loop has executed for all possible pairs in the `directions` list, and no further execution is possible because there are no more pairs to iterate over.**

This output state captures the final conditions of the variables after the loop has finished executing, including the values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `visited[nx][ny]`, and `queue`, based on the last iteration of the loop. It also specifies that the loop has executed for all possible pairs in the `directions` list and that no further execution is possible.
