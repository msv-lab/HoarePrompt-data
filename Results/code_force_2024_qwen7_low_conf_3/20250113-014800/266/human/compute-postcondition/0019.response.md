According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, and `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop will print 'No' and break if it executes at least once, we can infer that `t` must be decremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

So, the updated states are:
- `t` is now \(t - 1\) (it must still be between 1 and \(10^4\))
- `n` remains the same (it is still an odd integer greater than 1)
- `b` remains the same (it is still the string representation of the input provided by the user)

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1\), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user**
