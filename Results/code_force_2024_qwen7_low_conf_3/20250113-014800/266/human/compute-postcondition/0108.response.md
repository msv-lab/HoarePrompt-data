The code appends a tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. This means that the coordinates `(nx, ny)` are added to the end of the queue. The values of `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged, and all other variables in the initial state remain valid.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; the current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; `grid[nx][ny]` is `'<'`; and `dy` is `-1`; queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.**
