Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer, and `a` and `b` are lists of characters. If the condition (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<') is true, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, the condition is not checked and no changes are made to the program state.***
