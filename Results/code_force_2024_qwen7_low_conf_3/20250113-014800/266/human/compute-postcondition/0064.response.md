The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` changes the value of `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true, but either `grid[nx][ny] != '<'` or `dy != -1`. Additionally, `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>',` `dy` is `1`.**
