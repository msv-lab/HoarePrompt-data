The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. The previous state of `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, but since the assignment does not change the fact that it was already `True`, the state remains the same. All other variables and conditions are not affected.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` if the condition for appending was met.**
