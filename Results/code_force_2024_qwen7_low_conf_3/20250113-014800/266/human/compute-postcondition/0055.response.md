Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an odd integer, `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of "<" and ">". If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is undefined.
   - Each test case consists of two strings, each of length `n`, where each character in the strings is either "<" or ">".

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, `n` is read as an integer input.
   - Strings `a` and `b` are read as inputs of length `n`.
   - An inner loop runs from `1` to `n-1` with a step of `2`.

3. **Condition in Inner Loop:**
   - The condition checks if either:
     - `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or
     - `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'No' and breaks out of the inner loop.
   - If the inner loop completes without breaking, it prints 'yes'.

4. **Final State Analysis:**
   - If the loop completes without breaking after all `t` iterations, it means no instance of the condition was met for any `n` and the final output is 'yes'.
   - If the loop breaks in any of the iterations, it prints 'No' for that particular `n`.

5. **Final Variables:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is just the count of test cases.
   - `n` will be the last value of `n` considered in the loop.
   - `a` and `b` will be the last strings of length `n` read during the loop.
   - The final output depends on whether the condition was met for any `n` during the loop.

Thus, the final output state captures the essence of the loop execution and the resulting conditions on the variables.
