To determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues and how the variables change during each iteration.

### Given Information:
- `nx` is `x + dx`
- `ny` is `y + dy`
- `x` and `y` remain unchanged
- `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged
- `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`
- The queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`
- If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` becomes `True` and the new tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to the queue.
- If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, the queue remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `visited[nx][ny]` becomes `True` and the new tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to the queue.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Continuation:**
   - The loop will continue if there are elements in the queue.
   - Since the queue initially contains `(nx, ny)` and we are appending tuples to it under certain conditions, the queue will not be empty as long as the conditions for appending tuples are met.

2. **Update the States Based on Conditions:**
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` becomes `True` and the new tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to the queue. In this case, `nx` and `ny` will change, and the queue will contain the new tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, the queue remains unchanged. This means `nx` and `ny` will not change, but the queue still contains the original tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - Otherwise, `visited[nx][ny]` becomes `True` and the new tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to the queue. Similar to the first condition, `nx` and `ny` will change, and the queue will contain the new tuple `(nx, ny)`.

3. **Identify the Next Iteration's State:**
   - Regardless of the specific condition met, at the start of the next iteration, `nx` and `ny` will be updated to the new coordinates based on the conditions.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
   - `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged.
   - `visited[nx][ny]` will be `True` since it was updated in the previous iteration.
   - The queue will contain the updated tuple `(nx, ny)` if the condition for appending was met.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`. The queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**.
