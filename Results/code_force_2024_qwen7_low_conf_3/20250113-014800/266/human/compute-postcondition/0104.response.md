`nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are valid values from the `directions` list, which means they are either 0, 1, or -1. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`.**
