The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or match-case structure. Since there is no loop or match-case structure in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The program also prints 'No', but this print statement is outside the scope of the `break` statement's impact.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5**
