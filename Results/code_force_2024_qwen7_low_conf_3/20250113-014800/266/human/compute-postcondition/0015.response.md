The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console and does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `i` is the current index plus 2 (\( i + 2 \)), and the next valid value for \( i \) is \( i + 2 \). The string 'No' is printed to the console.**
