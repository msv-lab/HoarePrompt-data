The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This means that the value of `visited[nx][ny]` changes from `False` to `True`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`. The current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`. Additionally, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`. `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>`' or `dy` is not `-1`. The condition `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))` is true.**
