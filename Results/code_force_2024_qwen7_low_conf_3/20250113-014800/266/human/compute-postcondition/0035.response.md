Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `i_current + 4`, `a` and `b` are lists of characters. If `i + 1 < n` and both `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are equal to `<`, or if `a[i]` is equal to `<` and `b[i - 1]` is also equal to `<`, the conditions hold true. Otherwise, the conditions do not change from the initial state.***
