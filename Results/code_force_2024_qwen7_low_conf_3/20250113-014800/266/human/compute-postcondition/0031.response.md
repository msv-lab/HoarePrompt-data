Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `i_current + 2` (as long as `i_current + 2 < n`), `a` and `b` are lists of characters. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'`, or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
