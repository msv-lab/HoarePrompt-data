`queue` is appended with the tuple `(nx, ny)`. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `visited[nx][ny]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` and the new tuple `(nx, ny)` has been appended.**
