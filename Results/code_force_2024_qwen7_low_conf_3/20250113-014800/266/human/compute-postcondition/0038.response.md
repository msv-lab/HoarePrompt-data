The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(n \geq 3\), after the execution of this line, `n` will still satisfy these conditions, but its exact value will be the one entered by the user. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user (satisfying \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(n \geq 3\)), `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and `t` is reduced by 1**
