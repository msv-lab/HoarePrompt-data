To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over odd indices starting from 1 up to `n-1` with a step of 2. The condition inside the loop checks if the following conditions are true:
1. `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`
2. `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`

If either of these conditions is true, the loop prints "No" and breaks. If the loop completes without breaking, it prints "yes".

### Key Observations

1. **Range of `i`:** The loop runs for all odd `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
2. **Condition Check:** For each `i`, the loop checks if the character at position `i` in string `a` is equal to the character at position `i + 1` in string `b` and both are `<`. Alternatively, it checks if the character at position `i` in string `a` is equal to the character at position `i - 1` in string `b` and both are `<`.

### Conclusion

- If the loop prints "No" at any point, the loop will break, and the final output will be "No".
- If the loop completes without printing "No", the final output will be "yes".

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop, the variables will retain their last values. Since the loop modifies no other variables except potentially printing "No", the key variables are `a`, `b`, and `n`.

- `a` and `b` will be the strings provided by the user.
- `n` will be the last value of `n` it had before the loop started, which is an odd number starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes is determined by whether the condition inside the loop was ever met. If it was met at any point, the loop prints "No" and breaks. If not, it prints "yes".

**Output State:**
- `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^4` and `n >= 3`.
- `a` is the string entered by the user.
- `b` is the string entered by the user.
- The final output is "yes" if the loop did not print "No" during its execution, and "no" if it did.

**Final Output State:**
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^4` and `n >= 3`, `a` is the string entered by the user, `b` is the string entered by the user, the final output is "yes" if the loop did not print "No", and "no" if it did.**
