`visited[nx][ny]` is assigned the value `True`. This updates the value of `visited[nx][ny]` from its previous state (which was `True`) to `True` again. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `visited`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.**
