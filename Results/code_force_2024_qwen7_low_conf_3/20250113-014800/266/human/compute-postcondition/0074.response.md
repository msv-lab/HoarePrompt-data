To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the variables involved.

### Given Conditions:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `nx` is `x + dx`
  - `ny` is `y + dy`
  - `x` is unchanged
  - `y` is unchanged
  - `dx` is unchanged
  - `dy` is unchanged
- The conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` must hold true.
- `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`.
- If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
- If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
- If `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
- In all other cases, no changes occur.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each direction in `directions`. For the loop to continue, it must find a valid direction that satisfies the conditions mentioned above.

2. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `nx` and `ny` are updated based on `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.
   - The conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` must hold true.
   - `visited[nx][ny]` must be `False`.

3. **Queue and Changes**:
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - If `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that there exists at least one direction `(dx, dy)` that satisfies the conditions and updates the necessary variables.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `nx` should be updated to `x + dx`.
- `ny` should be updated to `y + dy`.
- `visited[nx][ny]` should be `False` (since it needs to be checked for the current direction).
- The queue should contain the tuple `(nx, ny)` under the specified conditions (`grid[nx][ny] == '<' and dy == -1`, `grid[nx][ny] == '>' and dy == 1`, or `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`).

### Final Answer:

State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` under the specified conditions**.
