`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer entered by the user**
