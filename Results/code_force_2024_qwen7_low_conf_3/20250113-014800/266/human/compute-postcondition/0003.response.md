`a` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is stored as a string since `input()` function returns a string. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is the string representation of the input provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is the string representation of the input provided by the user**
