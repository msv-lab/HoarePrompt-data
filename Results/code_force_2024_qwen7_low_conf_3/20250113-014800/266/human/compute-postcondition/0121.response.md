Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list.
   - `nx` is `x + dx`.
   - `ny` is `y + dy`.
   - The current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2`.
   - The current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`.
   - If `grid[nx][ny]` is `'<'` and `dy` is `-1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue` regardless of the value of `grid[nx][ny]` or the value of `dy`.

2. **Loop Execution**: For the next iteration, the loop will use the next pair `(dx, dy)` from the `directions` list.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since we are starting a new iteration, `dx` and `dy` will be the next pair from the `directions` list.
   - `nx` will be calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` will be calculated as `y + dy`.
   - We need to ensure that `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n`.
   - If `grid[nx][ny]` is `'<'` and `dy` is `-1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` will be `True` and `(nx, ny)` will be added to `queue`. Otherwise, `visited[nx][ny]` will be `True` and `(nx, ny)` will be added to `queue`.

Given these points, we can conclude the following:

- `dx` and `dy` will be the next pair from the `directions` list.
- `nx` will be `x + dx`.
- `ny` will be `y + dy`.
- The conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` must still hold true.
- Depending on the values of `grid[nx][ny]` and `dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` will be set to `True` and `(nx, ny)` will be added to `queue`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, the current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`. If `grid[nx][ny]` is `'<'` and `dy` is `-1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue` regardless of the value of `grid[nx][ny]` or the value of `dy`.**
