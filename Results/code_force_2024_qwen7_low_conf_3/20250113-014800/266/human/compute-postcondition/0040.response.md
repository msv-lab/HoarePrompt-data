The code `b = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user (satisfying \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(n \geq 3\)), `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a string containing the input provided by the user, `b` is the string entered by the user, and `t` is reduced by 1.**
