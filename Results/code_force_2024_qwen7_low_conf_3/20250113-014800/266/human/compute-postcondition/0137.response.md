The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` assigns the value `True` to the element in the `visited` list at the index `[nx][ny]`. This updates the visited status of the position `(nx, ny)` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.**
