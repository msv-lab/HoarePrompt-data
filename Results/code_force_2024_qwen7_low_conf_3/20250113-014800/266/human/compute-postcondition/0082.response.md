Postcondition: ***`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. This holds whether `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`. If either condition is met, the new tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to the queue.***
