Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(n \geq 3\), `i` is `n - 1` (if the loop did not break), `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and the loop either prints 'No' if any condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true, or prints 'Yes' if the loop completes without breaking.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is the string representation of the user's input, and `a` is the user's input.
- **Loop Behavior**:
  - The loop iterates over odd indices starting from 1 up to `n-1` (inclusive).
  - For each iteration, the loop checks if the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` holds true.
  - If the condition is true, the loop prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
  - If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'Yes'.

### After All Iterations:
- **Final Value of `i`**: The final value of `i` will be `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking. If the loop breaks, `i` will be the index where the condition was found to be true.
- **Conditions for Loop Completion**:
  - If the loop completes without breaking, `i` will be `n - 1` and the loop will print 'Yes'.
  - If the loop breaks due to the condition being true at any point, `i` will be the index where the condition was true, and the loop will print 'No'.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is as described above.
