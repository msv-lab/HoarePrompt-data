According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` contains all valid tuples \((nx, ny)\) that satisfy the conditions in the loop, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` for all such tuples. This means that the loop has processed all valid tuples in the current `queue` and found no valid tuple to add to the queue, leading to its termination.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `queue` is not empty. This can be achieved by ensuring there are valid tuples that meet the conditions to be added to the `queue`.

State: **`queue` must contain at least one valid tuple \((nx, ny)\) that satisfies the conditions in the loop and `visited[nx][ny]` is `False` for such tuples.**
