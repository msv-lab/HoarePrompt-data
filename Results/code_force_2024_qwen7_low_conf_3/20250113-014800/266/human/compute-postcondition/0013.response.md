Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `i` is an index where \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \) and the next valid value for \( i \) is \( i + 2 \), and if either \( a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' \) or \( a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<' \) is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing changes regarding these variables.***
