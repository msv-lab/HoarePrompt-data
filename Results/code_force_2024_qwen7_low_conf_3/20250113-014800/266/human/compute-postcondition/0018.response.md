To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the given code and the provided output states.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer entered by the user (assumed to be odd since the loop increments by 2)
- `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user
- `a` is assumed to be a list or array of characters corresponding to `b`

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the indices of `a` in steps of 2, checking if certain conditions are met:
```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('No')
        break
else:
    print('yes')
```

#### Key Observations
- The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.
- The loop will only execute if `n` is an odd integer greater than 1.
- The loop checks the characters at indices `i` and `i+1` or `i` and `i-1` for the condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`.
- If the condition is met, it prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
- If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'yes'.

### Final Output State
- **Case 1: The loop executes at least once**  
  - This means there exists an index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n-1\)) such that either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is true.
  - Therefore, the loop will print 'No' and break out of the loop.
- **Case 2: The loop does not execute**  
  - This means the loop condition `i + 1 < n` fails for all valid `i`, meaning `i` reaches `n-1` without finding the condition to be true.
  - In this case, the loop will complete without printing anything, and the program will print 'yes' in the `else` block.

### Output State After All Iterations
Given the above analysis, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains as `t` (unchanged).
- `n` remains as `n` (unchanged).
- `b` remains as `b` (unchanged).

The decision on whether to print 'No' or 'Yes' depends on the loop's execution. Since the loop can either execute at least once or not at all, the output state can be summarized as follows:

**Output State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\),
- `n` is an odd integer greater than 1,
- `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user,
- If the loop executes at least once, it prints 'No' and breaks.
- If the loop does not execute, it prints 'yes'.

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user. If the loop executes at least once, it prints 'No' and breaks. If the loop does not execute, it prints 'yes'.**
