The code `break` is used to exit the current loop. Since there is no loop specified in the initial state, we assume this `break` statement is within a loop that was previously defined. After executing `break`, the loop is exited, and the states of the variables outside the loop remain unchanged. The states of the variables inside the loop are not specified, so they are not updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, the current value of `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is '<' or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is '<', and the print statement 'No' has been executed, and we break out of the loop.**
