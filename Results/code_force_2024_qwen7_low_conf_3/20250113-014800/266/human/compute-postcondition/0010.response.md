Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
   - \( n \) is an odd integer greater than 1.
   - \( b \) is the string representation of the input provided by the user.
   - \( i \) is an index where \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over indices \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) with a step of 2. This means \( i \) takes values 1, 3, 5, ..., \( n-2 \) (since \( n \) is odd, \( n-1 \) is even, and the loop does not include \( n-1 \)).

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body checks if either \( a[i] == b[i+1] == '<' \) or \( a[i] == b[i-1] == '<' \) holds true.
   - If either condition is true, "No" is printed, and the loop terminates without further iterations.

4. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - \( t \) is still an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
   - \( n \) is still an odd integer greater than 1.
   - \( b \) is still the string representation of the input provided by the user.
   - \( i \) is the index just before the current iteration, and it satisfies \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \).

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) must be the next odd index in the sequence, which would be \( i + 2 \).
   - Since \( n \) is odd and the loop increments \( i \) by 2 each time, the next valid value for \( i \) is \( i + 2 \).

6. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if \( i + 2 \) is still within the bounds \( 1 \leq i < n-1 \).

7. **State Adjustments**:
   - \( t \) remains unchanged.
   - \( n \) remains unchanged.
   - \( b \) remains unchanged.
   - \( i \) becomes \( i + 2 \), ensuring it is within the valid range for the next iteration.

Given the above steps, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `i` is an index where \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \) and the next valid value for \( i \) is \( i + 2 \).**
