Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is `i_current + 2` (as long as `i_current + 2 < n`).
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Range of the For Loop:**
   - The for loop starts from `1` and increments by `2` until it reaches `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` takes odd values starting from `1` up to but not including `n`.

2. **Check the Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_current + 2`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by `2`, the next value of `i` would be `i_current + 4`.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i + 2 < n`.
   - This means that the next value `i + 2` should be less than `n`.

4. **Variables to Adjust:**
   - `i` needs to be set to `i_current + 4` for the next iteration.
   - `n` does not change as long as `i + 2 < n`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as there is no indication that they are modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be updated to `i_current + 4` while ensuring that `i + 2 < n`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 3).
- `i` is now `i_current + 4`.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `i_current + 4`, `a` and `b` are lists of characters.**
