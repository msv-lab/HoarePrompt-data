To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list.
   - `nx` is `x + dx`.
   - `ny` is `y + dy`.
   - `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`.
   - `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '<' and dy == -1`, then `queue` contains an additional tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '>' and dy == 1`, then `queue` contains one additional element `(nx, ny)`.
   - If `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is now `True` and `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - In all other cases, no change to `visited[nx][ny]` and `queue` is made.

3. **Determine Changes Based on Conditions:**
   - Since `visited[nx][ny]` is already `True` at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain `True` unless one of the conditions where `visited[nx][ny]` changes is met.
   - The only condition that can change `queue` is if `grid[nx][ny]` matches specific values and `dy` meets certain criteria.

4. **Conditions for Adding to Queue:**
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '<' and dy == -1`, then `queue` gets an additional tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '>' and dy == 1`, then `queue` gets one additional element `(nx, ny)`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - If neither of these conditions is met (which is the case based on the information given), no changes are made to `visited[nx][ny]` and `queue`.
   - Therefore, `visited[nx][ny]` remains `True`, and `queue` does not change.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.**
