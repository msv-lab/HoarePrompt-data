`x` and `y` are assigned the values of the tuple retrieved from `queue` using the `popleft()` method. This operation removes the first element from the `queue`. The `visited[x][y]` state for this tuple is updated to `True` because it has been processed. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain the tuple \((nx, ny)\) that was removed; `x` is the first element of the removed tuple; `y` is the second element of the removed tuple; `visited[x][y]` is `True`.**
