The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` assigns the value `True` to the element `visited[nx][ny]`. This changes the state of `visited[nx][ny]` but does not affect the values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, or the elements in the queue.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`. `visited[nx][ny]` is now `True`.**
