`nx` and `ny` are updated based on the formula `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `visited[nx][ny]` are updated accordingly. The queue will contain the tuple `(nx, ny)` if the condition for appending was met in the previous iteration. 

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` if the condition for appending was met.**
