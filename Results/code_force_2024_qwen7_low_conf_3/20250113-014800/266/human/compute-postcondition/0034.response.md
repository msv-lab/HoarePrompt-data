The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Since no such statement is mentioned in the provided code snippet, the only effect is that we exit the current context (which could be a loop or a conditional block).

Given that the initial state includes `n` being an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` being `i_current + 4`, and `a` and `b` being lists of characters, none of these are changed by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `i_current + 4`, `a` and `b` are lists of characters**
