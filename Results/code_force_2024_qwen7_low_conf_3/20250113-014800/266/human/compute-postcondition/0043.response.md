The code simply prints 'No', and this operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, the current value of `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is '<' or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is '<', and the print statement 'No' has been executed.**
