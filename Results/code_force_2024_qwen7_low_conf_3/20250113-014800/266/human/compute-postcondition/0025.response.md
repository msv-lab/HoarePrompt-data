The code prints 'No', but it does not affect any variable values. The conditions involving `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement and retains the original conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, the condition (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<') is satisfied, and 'No' is printed.**
