The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. Given the initial conditions, the values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, and `visited[nx][ny]` is still `True`. The `grid[nx][ny]` remains `'>',` and `dy` still equals `1`.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; the current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`; additionally, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>',` and `dy` equals `1`; `(nx, ny)` has been appended to `queue`.**
