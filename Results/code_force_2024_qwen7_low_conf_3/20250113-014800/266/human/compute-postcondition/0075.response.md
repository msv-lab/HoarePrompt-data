The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` by assigning them the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `visited[nx][ny]`, and the queue are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the updated values of `nx` and `ny` are `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
