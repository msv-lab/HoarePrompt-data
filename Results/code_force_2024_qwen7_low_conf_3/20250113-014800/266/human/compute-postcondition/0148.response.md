The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `grid`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `grid` is a list of two strings, each string consists of exactly n characters which are either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.

The function has four cases for its return value:
- Case_1: The program returns `True`.
- Case_2: The program returns `True`.
- Case_3: The program returns `True`.
- Case_4: The program returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a grid represented as a list of two strings, and return `True` in three specific cases and `False` in one specific case.
