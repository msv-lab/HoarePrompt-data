The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `i_current + 2` (as long as `i_current + 2 < n`), `a` and `b` are lists of characters**
