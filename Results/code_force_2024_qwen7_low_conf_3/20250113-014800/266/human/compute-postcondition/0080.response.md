`visited[nx][ny]` is assigned the value `True`. This updates the value of `visited[nx][ny]` from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
