Postcondition: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and the following conditions hold: if `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. Otherwise, if `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. In all other cases, no changes occur.**
