Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `i` is an index where \(0 \leq i < n-1\). If either \(i+1 < n\) and `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` holds true, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
