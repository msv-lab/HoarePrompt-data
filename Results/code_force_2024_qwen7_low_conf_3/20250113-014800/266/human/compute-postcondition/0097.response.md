Postcondition: ***`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, the queue remains unchanged. If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, the queue remains unchanged. In all other cases, the queue remains unchanged.***
