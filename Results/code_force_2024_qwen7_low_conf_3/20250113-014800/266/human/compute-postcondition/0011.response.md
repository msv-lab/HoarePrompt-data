The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console. It does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `i` is an index where \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \) and the next valid value for \( i \) is \( i + 2 \). Printed: 'No'**
