The code `break` does not affect any variables' values but may exit a loop or the most internal if statement. Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `i_current + 2` (as long as `i_current + 2 < n`), `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
