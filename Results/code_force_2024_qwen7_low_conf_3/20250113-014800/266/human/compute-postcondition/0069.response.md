The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true; the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**.
