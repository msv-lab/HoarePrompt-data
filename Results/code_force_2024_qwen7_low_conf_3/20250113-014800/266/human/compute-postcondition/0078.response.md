`visited[nx][ny]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `nx` is `x + dx`, the value of `ny` is `y + dy`, and the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `visited[nx][ny]` before this assignment are unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
