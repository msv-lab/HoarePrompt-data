According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer, which is already given as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself since it already meets the required condition.

The key point here is that `t` must be defined and non-zero for the loop to execute. Since the problem statement mentions that `t` is equal to the integer input, we can assume `t` is already defined and within the valid range. However, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed a positive integer, which is already given.

Additionally, the value of `n` is undefined at the start of the loop, but this does not affect the ability of the loop to execute because the loop's condition is based solely on `t`.

So, the only necessary state to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is defined and meets its constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is defined, `n` is undefined**
