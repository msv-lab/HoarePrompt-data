The code appends a tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. Given the conditions in the initial state, `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x` and `y` via `dx` and `dy`, respectively. The values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy their respective constraints, and `visited[nx][ny]` is already `True`. The condition involving `dx` and `dy` indicates that movement is horizontal.

The `queue` is updated, but no other variables are affected. The conditions about `visited` and `grid` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state includes the updated queue and the unchanged values of `nx`, `ny`, `visited[nx][ny]`, and `grid[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; the current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>`` or `dy` is not `-1`; `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))` is true; `queue` contains `(nx, ny)`**
