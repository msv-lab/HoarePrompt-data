`queue` is appended with the tuple `(nx, ny)`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `visited[nx][ny]`, and the addition of `(nx, ny)` to `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`; `queue` contains one additional element `(nx, ny)`.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`; `queue` contains one additional element `(nx, ny)`**
