The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends a tuple containing the values of `nx` and `ny` to the list `queue`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are unchanged from their initial states, and the other variables (`x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `visited[nx][ny]`, `grid[nx][ny]`, etc.) remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>', `dy` is `1`, queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
