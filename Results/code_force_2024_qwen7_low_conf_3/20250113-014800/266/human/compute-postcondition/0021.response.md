The code `a = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since `n` and `b` are derived from the user's input, and `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the output state will reflect that `a` now holds the user's input, while `n` and `b` retain their initial state based on the user's input.

Given that `n` is obtained from input and `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` retains its initial value from user input.
- `b` remains the string representation of the user's input.
- `a` is now set to the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `a` is the user's input**
