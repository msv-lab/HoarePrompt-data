The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block it is inside is being exited. Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
