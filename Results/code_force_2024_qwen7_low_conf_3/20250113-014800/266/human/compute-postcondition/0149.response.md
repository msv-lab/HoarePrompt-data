Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `grid`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `grid` is a list of two strings, each string consists of exactly n characters which are either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.

The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to check if there is a path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (1, n-1) in the grid. The BFS uses a queue to explore possible moves based on the direction of the arrows.

- If the function finds a path from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), it returns `True`.
- If no such path exists, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `grid` contains exactly two strings of length `n` with characters '<' or '>'. It does not handle cases where these assumptions are violated.
- The function only checks for valid paths using the specified rules (i.e., moving according to the arrow direction and staying within grid boundaries). It does not account for additional constraints or special conditions that might be implied by the annotations but are not explicitly handled in the code.**

This summary covers the main functionality of the function and includes the necessary edge cases and missing considerations.
