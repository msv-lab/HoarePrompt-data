`queue.append((nx, ny))` appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the list `queue`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `visited[nx][ny]`, and the content of `queue` before this line of code are preserved.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue` and then `queue` contains one additional element `(nx, ny)`.**
