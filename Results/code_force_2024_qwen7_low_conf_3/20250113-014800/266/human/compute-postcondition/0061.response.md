The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not changed by this operation. The condition `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `grid[nx][ny]` is `<` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is `-1`, the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` still hold true, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is `<`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
