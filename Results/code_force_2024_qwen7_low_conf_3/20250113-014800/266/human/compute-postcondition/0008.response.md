The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most nested loop in a block of code. In this case, it does not specify which loop it is breaking out of, but it implies that there is a loop or conditional statement where the `break` is placed. Since the exact loop is not specified, we assume the `break` is within a loop where the condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is being checked. Upon encountering this condition, the loop is exited.

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, nor does it affect the conditions that are true before the statement. It simply exits the loop or conditional block.

Therefore, the Output State remains as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `i` is an index where \(0 \leq i < n-1\), and either \(i+1 < n\) and `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`; 'No' is printed.**
