The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or block it is within. In this case, since the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is satisfied, the `break` statement will cause the loop to terminate. However, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables outside of the loop. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `No` being printed does not affect the variables' values either.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, the condition (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<') is no longer checked, and 'No' is printed.**
