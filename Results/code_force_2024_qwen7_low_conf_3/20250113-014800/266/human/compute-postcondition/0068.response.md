The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` updates the `visited` variable at the position `[nx][ny]` to `True`. This means that the position `(nx, ny)` has been marked as visited. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` remain unchanged, and the direction of movement (right or left) also remains the same. The condition `grid[nx][ny] != '>'` is still valid.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true. The direction of movement is either right (`dx == 1` and `dy == 0`) or left (`dx == -1` and `dy == 0`), but `grid[nx][ny] != '>'`.**
