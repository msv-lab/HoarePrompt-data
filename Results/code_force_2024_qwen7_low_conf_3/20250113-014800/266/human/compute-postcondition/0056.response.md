The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to work with test cases that are not passed directly to the function but are implied by the constraints provided. The function will process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), an integer `n` (such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even), and two strings of length `n` where each character is either "<" or ">".

Based on the given output cases, the function needs to handle two scenarios:

- Case_1: If any of the strings contains a character other than "<" or ">", the function should return an error message indicating invalid input.
- Case_2: If all characters in both strings are either "<" or ">", the function should return some specific value or perform some operation based on the input.

However, since the exact return values or operations for Case_2 are not specified, we can only describe the conditions under which the function operates.
