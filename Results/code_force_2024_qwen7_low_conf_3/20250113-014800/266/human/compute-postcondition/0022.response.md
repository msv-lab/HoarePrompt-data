`b` is assigned the value of `input()`. This means that `b` will hold the string representation of whatever the user inputs. The value of `n` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is the string representation of the user's input, `a` is the user's input**
