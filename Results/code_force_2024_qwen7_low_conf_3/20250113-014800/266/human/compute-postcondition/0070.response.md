Postcondition: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true; if `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. Otherwise, none of these changes occur.**
