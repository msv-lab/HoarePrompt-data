The code snippet simply prints 'No', which does not affect any variable values. The variables `t`, `n`, `b`, `i` retain their initial values, and the conditions specified in the initial state are still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `i` is an index where \(0 \leq i < n-1\), and either \(i+1 < n\) and `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`; 'No' is printed.**
