The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. The values of `nx`, `ny`, and `visited[nx][ny]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the `queue` now contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` in addition to its previous contents.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` in addition to its previous contents.**
