The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, and the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` still hold. The state of `grid[nx][ny]` remains `'<'`, and `dy` is `-1`.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; the current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; `grid[nx][ny]` is `'<'`; and `dy` is `-1`.**
