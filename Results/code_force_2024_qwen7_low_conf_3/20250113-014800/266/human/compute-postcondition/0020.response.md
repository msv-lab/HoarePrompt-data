The code assigns the value of `input()` to `n`, which is an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `b` is unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t - 1\), `n` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user**
