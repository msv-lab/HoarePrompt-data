Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `b` is the string representation of the input provided by the user, `i` is the current index plus 2 (\( i + 2 \)), and the next valid value for \( i \) is \( i + 2 \). If the condition `i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is satisfied, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and print 'No' to the console. If the condition is not satisfied, the program continues to execute the subsequent code without any specific action mentioned in the else part.***
