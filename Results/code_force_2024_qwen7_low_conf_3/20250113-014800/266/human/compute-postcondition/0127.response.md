`visited[nx][ny]` is assigned the value `True`. This changes the state of the `visited` variable at the index `[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`; `visited[nx][ny]` is now `True`.**
