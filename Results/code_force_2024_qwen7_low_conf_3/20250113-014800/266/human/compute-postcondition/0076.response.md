The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` sets the value of `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This changes the value of `visited[nx][ny]` from `False` to `True`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and the queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
