Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs with `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 each time until `i` is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Condition in the Loop Body:**
   - The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is evaluated.
   - If this condition is true, "No" is printed and the program state is not changed.
   - If the condition is false, no changes are made to the program state.

4. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - We know `i` is an integer.
   - Since the loop increments by 2, `i` could be 1, 3, 5, etc.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - No specific values for `a` and `b` are mentioned, so we assume they retain their values from the previous iteration.

5. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 2, so if `i` was odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5), the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - For example, if `i` was 1, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - If `i` was 3, the next value of `i` would be 5.

6. **Determine the New Range for the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < n` and `i` is within the range specified by the loop.
   - Therefore, `i` must be such that `i + 2 < n` for the next iteration to occur.

7. **Final Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `i + 2` if the current `i` plus 2 is still within the valid range.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the current `i` as `i_current`.

Given the loop increments by 2, the next `i` value would be `i_current + 2` as long as it is still within the valid range.

Thus, the state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `i_current + 2` (as long as `i_current + 2 < n`), `a` and `b` are lists of characters**.
