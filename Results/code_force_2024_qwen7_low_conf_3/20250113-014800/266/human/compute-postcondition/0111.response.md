The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`, which means the cell `(nx, ny)` has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` and `dy` are defined and valid values from the `directions` list; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`. The current value of `nx` satisfies `0 <= nx < 2` and the current value of `ny` satisfies `0 <= ny < n`. Additionally, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`. `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>', ` and `dy` equals `1`.**
