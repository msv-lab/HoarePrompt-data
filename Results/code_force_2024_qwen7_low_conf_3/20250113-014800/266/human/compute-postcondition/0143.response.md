Postcondition: ***`dx` and `dy` are the next pair from the `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the additional element `(nx, ny)`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, no additional elements are added to `queue`. Otherwise, if `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `queue` contains one additional element `(nx, ny)`.***
