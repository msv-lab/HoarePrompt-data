The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` changes the value of `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values mentioned in the initial state still hold true.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is `-1`, the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` still hold true, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `grid[nx][ny]` is `<`.**
