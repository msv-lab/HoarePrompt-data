Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions for the robot to reach the target cell (2, n). Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads \( n \), the first row of the grid as string \( a \), and the second row of the grid as string \( b \).

2. **Condition Check**: The program iterates through the odd indices \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) (assuming \( n \) is even, which is a constraint of the problem). For each odd index \( i \), it checks if \( a[i] = '<' \) and if either \( b[i+1] = '<' \) or \( b[i-1] = '<' \). If such an index is found, the program immediately prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the robot cannot reach the target cell (2, n). If no such index is found, the program prints 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately. Since \( n \) is even, the last index \( n-1 \) is always an odd index. The program correctly handles the condition for the last odd index \( n-1 \) by checking \( b[n-2] \).

4. **Constraints and Assumptions**: The program correctly assumes that \( n \) is even and that the strings \( a \) and \( b \) only contain the characters "<" and ">". This aligns with the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program logic is sound and correctly implements the solution for determining whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the provided conditions.

Correctness: **True**
