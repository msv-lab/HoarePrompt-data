Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks for certain conditions (when `i` is odd and both arrows point left) and prints 'No' immediately upon finding such a condition. However, this logic is incomplete and does not account for all possible paths the robot could take.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
6
<>><<>
<>><<<
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the provided program would incorrectly output:
```
No
```

This happens because the program only checks for the condition where `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` when `i` is odd, but it fails to account for other valid paths. For instance, in the above example, the robot can follow the path `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)`, which leads to the goal cell `(2, 6)`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
