Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Reachability**: The program checks for specific conditions using the lines:
   ```python
   if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
       print('No')
       break
   ```
   This logic is intended to check if the robot cannot reach the final column (2, n). However, this condition does not fully capture all scenarios where the robot cannot reach the target cell. For instance, it fails to consider other configurations of arrows that might prevent the robot from reaching (2, n).

2. **Assumption of Even n**: While the problem states that \(n\) is even, the program incorrectly handles the case when \(i\) is odd. The loop starts from 1 and increments by 2, which means it only checks cells with odd indices. This ignores the possibility of arrows affecting the robot's movement through even-indexed cells.

3. **Printing 'yes' Without Proper Condition**: The program prints 'yes' only if the loop completes without breaking. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not cover all scenarios where the robot can reach the target cell. It should instead use a more comprehensive approach to verify reachability.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Traverse the grid to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step.
- Use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from (1, 1) to (2, n).
- Ensure that the logic accounts for all possible configurations of arrows and their effects on the robot's movement.

In conclusion, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n), making it incorrect according to the problem description.
