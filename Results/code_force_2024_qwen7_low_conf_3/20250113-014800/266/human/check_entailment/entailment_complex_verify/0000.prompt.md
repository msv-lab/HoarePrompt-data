You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings, each of length n, where each character in the strings is either "<" or ">".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an odd integer, `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of "<" and ">". If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \(t\) (such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), an integer \(n\) (such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n\) is even), and two strings \(a\) and \(b\) of length \(n\) where each character is either "<" or ">". For each test case, the function checks if there exists any index \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n-1\) and \(i\) is odd) such that \(a[i] = '<'\) and either \(b[i+1] = '<'\) or \(b[i-1] = '<'\). If such an index is found, the function prints 'No' and terminates the current test case. If no such index is found for any test case, the function prints 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where the strings contain characters other than "<" or ">".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks for certain conditions (when `i` is odd and both arrows point left) and prints 'No' immediately upon finding such a condition. However, this logic is incomplete and does not account for all possible paths the robot could take.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
6
<>><<>
<>><<<
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the provided program would incorrectly output:
```
No
```

This happens because the program only checks for the condition where `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` when `i` is odd, but it fails to account for other valid paths. For instance, in the above example, the robot can follow the path `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)`, which leads to the goal cell `(2, 6)`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
