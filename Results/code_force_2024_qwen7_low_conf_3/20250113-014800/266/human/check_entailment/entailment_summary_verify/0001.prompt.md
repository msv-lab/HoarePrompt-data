You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \(t\) (such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), an integer \(n\) (such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n\) is even), and two strings \(a\) and \(b\) of length \(n\) where each character is either "<" or ">". For each test case, the function checks if there exists any index \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n-1\) and \(i\) is odd) such that \(a[i] = '<'\) and either \(b[i+1] = '<'\) or \(b[i-1] = '<'\). If such an index is found, the function prints 'No' and terminates the current test case. If no such index is found for any test case, the function prints 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where the strings contain characters other than "<" or ">".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, the size of the grid, and the two rows of the grid.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The loop iterates over odd indices (i.e., `1, 3, 5, ...`) of the grid.
   - For each odd index `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `i + 1` is within bounds (`i + 1 < n`) and both `a[i]` (first row) and `b[i + 1]` (second row) are `<`, indicating the robot cannot progress to the next column.
     - If `a[i]` (first row) and `b[i - 1]` (second row) are `<`, also indicating the robot cannot progress to the previous column.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - If any of these conditions are met, the program immediately prints "No" and breaks out of the loop, assuming the robot cannot reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such condition, the program prints "yes", indicating the robot can potentially reach the target cell.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the even indices, which means it might miss some configurations where the robot could still reach `(2, n)` by moving through even indices.
   - It assumes that if a specific condition is violated, the robot cannot reach the goal, which may not be true in all cases.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the provided examples, the program correctly identifies cases where the robot cannot reach the target, but it incorrectly identifies some cases as unreachable due to the limited condition checking.

Given the analysis, the program does not cover all possible scenarios to ensure the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
