The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of prison cells) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing bidirectional corridors between cells). It constructs a graph from the given edges and then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to identify all connected components within the graph. The function returns a list of these connected components. 

Specifically, the function performs the following actions:
1. It initializes a graph using a defaultdict, where each key is a cell and the value is a list of cells directly connected to it via the given corridors.
2. It initializes a `visited` list to keep track of which cells have been explored.
3. It iterates over each cell from 1 to `n`, performing BFS on unvisited cells to find all connected components.
4. It returns a list of all identified connected components.

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If there are no edges, the graph will be a set of isolated nodes, and each node will be a separate connected component.
- If all cells are interconnected, there will be only one connected component, which includes all cells.
- The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and that the edges are valid (i.e., they connect cells within the range 1 to `n`).

Missing functionality: The annotations suggest that the code constructs the graph and identifies connected components, but the provided code snippet does not explicitly include the BFS implementation. Therefore, it is implied that the BFS is correctly implemented elsewhere in the function, but this is not shown in the given code snippet.
