Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states given:**
   - `i` is `original_i + 1`
   - `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`
   - `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`
   - `min_cost` is the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop runs from `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the last value it iterated over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `j` is still within the range `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be increased by 1 (to `j + 1`).

5. **Update the states:**
   - `i` remains the same as it is not changed within the loop.
   - `cost_i` remains the same as it is not changed within the loop.
   - `cost_j` needs to be updated to `len(components[j + 1])`.
   - `min_cost` remains the same unless it is updated inside the loop, but we cannot assume it changes without knowing the loop body.

Given these steps, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j + 1])`, `min_cost` is the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
