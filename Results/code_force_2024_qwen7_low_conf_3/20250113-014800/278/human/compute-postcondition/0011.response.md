`cost_i` is assigned the value of `len(components[i]) ** 2`. This means the value of `cost_i` is the square of the length of the sublist `components[i]`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j + 1]`, and `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j + 1]`, and `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[i]`**.
