`cost_j` is assigned the value `len(components[j]) ** 2`. The value of `components[j]` is not specified in the initial state, so it is represented as `len(components[j]) ** 2`. The states of the other variables (`i` and `cost_i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, and `cost_j` is `len(components[j]) ** 2`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, and `cost_j` is `len(components[j]) ** 2`**
