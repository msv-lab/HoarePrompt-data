`cost_i` is assigned the value of the length of `components[i]` squared. The length of `components[i]` is a specific value, but since it is not given, we will keep it in terms of its length. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`), `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared.
