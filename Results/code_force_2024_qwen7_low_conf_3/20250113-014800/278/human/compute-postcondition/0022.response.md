The code updates the value of `cost_j` to the square of the length of `components[j]`. However, the initial values of `j` and `components[j]` are not provided. We know from the initial state that `i` is `original_i + 1` and `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`.

Given this, we can deduce that:
- `i` is `original_i + 1`
- `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`

After executing the line `cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2`, `cost_j` is set to the square of the length of `components[j]`. However, without the value of `j`, we cannot determine the exact value of `cost_j`. The values of `i` and `cost_i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j]) ** 2`**
