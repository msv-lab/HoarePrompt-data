`cost_j` is assigned the value of `len(components[j])**2`. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unspecified. However, we know that `i` is less than `len(components)` and `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`.

Therefore, after executing the line of code, the updated values are:
- `cost_j` is now `len(components[j])**2`
- `i` is still less than `len(components)`
- `cost_i` remains `len(components[i])`

Output State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])**2`**
