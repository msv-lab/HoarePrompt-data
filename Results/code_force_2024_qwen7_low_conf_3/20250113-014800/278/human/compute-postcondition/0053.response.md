The function `bfs` accepts a parameter `start`. `start` is an integer representing the starting node in the graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency list where `graph` is a dictionary mapping each node to a list of its neighbors, and `visited` is a boolean list of the same length as the number of nodes, initially set to `False`.

After executing the function body, the function returns a set of nodes that belong to the connected component of `start` in the graph.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `bfs` is to accept an integer `start`, and return the set of nodes in the connected component of `start` in the graph.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter start, returns the set of nodes in the connected component of 'start' in the graph 'graph'.**
