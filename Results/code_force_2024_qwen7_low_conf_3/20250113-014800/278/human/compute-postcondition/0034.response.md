According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the relationship between `i` and `len(components)`.

1. The loop starts when `j` is set to `i + 1`.
2. The loop continues as long as `j < len(components)`.

Given that `i` is `len(components)` at the start, let's analyze this:

- If `i` is equal to `len(components)`, then `i + 1` would be `len(components) + 1`.
- Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, the initial value of `j` would be `len(components) + 1`.
- Because `j` must be less than `len(components)` for the loop to execute, `j = len(components) + 1` would never satisfy the condition `j < len(components)`.

Therefore, the loop cannot execute under these conditions because `i` is already equal to `len(components)`, making `j` start from `len(components) + 1`, which is always outside the range of `len(components)`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `len(components)`.

State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `cost_i + cost_j + c` computed during the loop iterations**
