Output State: **`i` is `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i - 1]) ** 2`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j]) ** 2` for the last iteration where `j` was `len(components) - 1`, `min_cost` is the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c` for all valid pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `j < len(components)`**
