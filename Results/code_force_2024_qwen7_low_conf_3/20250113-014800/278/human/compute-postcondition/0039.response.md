`cost_i` is updated to be the square of `len(components[i])`. The previous value of `cost_i` was `len(components[i])`, so now `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`. The value of `cost_j` and `min_cost` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`, `cost_j` is `len(components[i + 1])`, `min_cost` is the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`, `cost_j` is `len(components[i + 1])`, `min_cost` is the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
