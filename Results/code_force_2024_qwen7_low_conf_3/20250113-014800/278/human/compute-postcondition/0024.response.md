Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is `original_i + 1`
   - `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`
   - `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`
   - `min_cost` is the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `len(components)`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the new state at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Key Variables to Consider**:
   - `i`: This remains constant throughout the loop as it is initialized outside and only incremented once before the loop starts.
   - `j`: This is the variable that changes in each iteration.
   - `cost_i`: This is calculated once before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - `cost_j`: This changes with each iteration of the loop.
   - `min_cost`: This is updated based on the values of `cost_i` and `cost_j`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range `i + 1` to `len(components)`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be set to `i + 2` (since `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration).

6. **Updated States**:
   - `i` remains `original_i + 1`.
   - `cost_i` remains the same as it was calculated before the loop started.
   - `cost_j` now refers to `len(components[i + 2])`.
   - `min_cost` remains unchanged unless updated in the loop body, but we assume no update for this analysis.

Based on these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[i + 2])`, `min_cost` is the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
