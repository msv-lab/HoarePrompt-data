Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(u_i, v_i)` represents a bi-directional corridor between cells `u_i` and `v_i`.

The function first calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of connected components in the graph formed by the prison cells and corridors. If there is only one connected component, the function returns `-1`, indicating that all cells are already connected and no additional corridors need to be built.

If there are multiple connected components, the function calculates the minimum cost required to connect all components into a single connected component. It does this by iterating over all pairs of components and calculating the cost of connecting them, which is given by the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two components plus the cost `c` to build a single corridor. The function then returns the minimum cost found among all pairs of components.

The function can return either `-1` if all cells are already connected, or the minimum cost required to connect all cells if there are multiple connected components.**

This summary includes all potential cases and the actions performed by the function, adhering to the given annotations and the actual code logic.
