In the given context, let's analyze the code snippet step by step:

- **Initial State**:
  - `i` is `original_i + 1`.
  - `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`.
  - `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`.
  - `min_cost` is the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2
  ```

This line of code calculates the square of the length of `components[i]` and assigns it to `cost_i`. Let's break this down:

- The value of `i` is `original_i + 1`.
- `cost_i` is now assigned the value of `len(components[original_i + 1]) ** 2`.

Since the original value of `cost_i` was `len(components[original_i + 1])`, after this assignment, `cost_i` will be squared. The values of `cost_j`, `min_cost`, and `j` remain unchanged.

- **Updated States**:
  - `i` remains `original_i + 1`.
  - `cost_i` is now `len(components[original_i + 1]) ** 2`.
  - `cost_j` remains `len(components[j])`.
  - `min_cost` remains the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given code snippet is:

Output State: **`i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1]) ** 2`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, `min_cost` is the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
