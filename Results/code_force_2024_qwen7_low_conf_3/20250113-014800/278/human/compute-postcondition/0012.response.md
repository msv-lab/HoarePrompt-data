In the initial state, `i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j + 1]`, and `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[i]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2
```

This code updates the value of `cost_j` to be the square of the length of `components[j]`. The previous value of `cost_j` was the square of the length of `components[j + 1]`. Since the value of `j` is not defined in the snippet, we cannot determine the exact change, but we know that `cost_j` now holds the square of the length of `components[j]`.

The output state is:
**`i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is `cost_i + len(components[j])**2 + c`, `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[i]`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j]`**.
