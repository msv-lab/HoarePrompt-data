`min_cost` is assigned the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`. The values of `i` and `j` are not affected, and neither are `components`, `cost_i`, `cost_j`, or `c`. The `min_cost` variable is updated based on the comparison.

Output State: **`i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, `min_cost` is the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
