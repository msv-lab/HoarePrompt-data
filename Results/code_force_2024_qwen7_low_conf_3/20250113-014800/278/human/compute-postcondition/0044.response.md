`cost_j` is assigned the value of `len(components[j])**2`. The value of `components[j]` is the length of the j-th element in the list `components`, and this value is squared. The values of `i` and `cost_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])**2`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])**2`**
