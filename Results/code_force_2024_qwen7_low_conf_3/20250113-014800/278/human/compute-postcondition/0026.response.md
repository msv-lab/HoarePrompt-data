The code updates the value of `cost_j` to the square of the length of `components[j]`. The values of `i` and `cost_i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])**2**.**
