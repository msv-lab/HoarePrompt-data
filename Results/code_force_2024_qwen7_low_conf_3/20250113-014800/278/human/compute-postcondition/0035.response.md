The code assigns the value of `len(components[i]) ** 2` to `cost_i`. This means that `cost_i` now holds the square of the length of the list at index `i` in `components`. The other variables (`min_cost` and `components`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `cost_i + cost_j + c` computed during the loop iterations**
