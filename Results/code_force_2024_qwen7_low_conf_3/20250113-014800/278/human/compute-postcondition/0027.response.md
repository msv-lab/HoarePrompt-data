`min_cost` is assigned the minimum value between itself and `cost_i + cost_j + c`. Here, `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])` and `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`. The value of `min_cost` is updated to the smaller value between its current value and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, `min_cost` is the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
