To ensure the for loop executes, we need to analyze the loop condition `for j in range(i + 1, len(components))`. This means:

1. The loop will start with `j = i + 1` and continue until `j < len(components)`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one element in `components` such that `i + 1` is less than the length of `components`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer
- `c` is an integer
- `components` is a non-empty list
- `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`)

We need to focus on `i` and `components` to determine the necessary adjustments.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Non-empty List**: The `components` list is already stated as non-empty, so we don't need to adjust this part directly related to the loop execution.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than the length of `components`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of `components` minus one.

Since `components` is a non-empty list, its length is at least 1. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than the length of `components`.

### Conclusion:
- `i` must be less than the length of `components` (which is at least 1).
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `min_cost`) do not affect the loop's execution directly based on the given information.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`)**
