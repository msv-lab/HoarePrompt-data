To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information:

1. The loop is iterating over the `components` list using `range(len(components))`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `i` represents the current index being processed in the loop.

Given this, we need to consider what changes will occur for the loop to continue executing:

- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `components`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- The variable `i` will be increased by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(components)`.

Based on these points, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `components`.

Since no specific values for `i` or `components` were provided at the end of the previous iteration, we will use general terms:

- `i` must be less than the length of `components`.
- The length of `components` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1 and still needs to satisfy the loop condition.

**State: **`i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was previously less than `len(components)`) and `i` must be less than `len(components)`**
