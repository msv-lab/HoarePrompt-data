`min_cost` is assigned the value of the minimum between itself and `cost_i + cost_j + c`. The values of `i`, `cost_i`, `j`, `cost_j`, and `c` remain unchanged. The state of `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`.

Output State: **`i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[original_i + 1])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, `min_cost` is the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
