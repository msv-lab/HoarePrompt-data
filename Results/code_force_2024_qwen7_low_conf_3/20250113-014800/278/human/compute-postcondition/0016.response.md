The code `cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2` calculates the square of the length of `components[j]` and assigns it to `cost_j`. Given the initial conditions:

- `i` is less than the length of `components`
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer
- `c` is an integer
- `components` is a non-empty list
- `min_cost` is the minimum of `cost_i + len(components[j + 1])`, where `j` is `i + 2`
- `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`

The only change in this code is that `cost_j` is updated to be the square of the length of `components[j]`, where `j` is `i + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum of `cost_i + len(components[j + 1])`, `j` is `i + 2`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[i + 2]) ** 2`**
