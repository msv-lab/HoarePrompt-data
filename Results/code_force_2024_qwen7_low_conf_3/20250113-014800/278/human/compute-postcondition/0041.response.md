`min_cost` is assigned the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`. The values of `i`, `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c` are used in this calculation, but the exact value of `min_cost` before the assignment is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, `min_cost` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, `min_cost` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
