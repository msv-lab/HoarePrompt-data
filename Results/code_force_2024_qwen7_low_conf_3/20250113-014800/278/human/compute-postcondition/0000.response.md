The code `components = func_1(n, edges)` calls a function `func_1` with the arguments `n` and `edges`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, so its exact behavior cannot be determined. However, based on typical graph theory functions, `func_1` likely returns the number of connected components in the graph represented by `n` (number of nodes/cells) and `edges` (list of edges/bi-directional corridors). The variables `n`, `m`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `components` is assigned the result of the function.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only say that `components` is now holding the result of the function call. The output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells; `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors; `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor; `components` is the result of the function `func_1(n, edges)`.**
