`cost_j` is assigned the value of `len(components[j]) ** 2`. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `cost_j`. However, we know that `i` is `original_i + 1` and `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`.

Since `j` is not specified, `components[j]` could be any list, and thus `len(components[j])` could be any non-negative integer. Therefore, `cost_j` will be the square of that length.

Output State: **`i` is `original_i + 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j]) ** 2`**
