`cost_i` is assigned the value of the square of the length of `components[i]`. The previous value of `cost_i` is not specified, so it is updated to `len(components[i])**2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum of `cost_i + len(components[j + 1])`, `j` is `i + 2`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])**2`.
