The code initializes `min_cost` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, and `components`). Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `min_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells; `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors; `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor; `components` is the result of the function `func_1(n, edges)`, and `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`).**
