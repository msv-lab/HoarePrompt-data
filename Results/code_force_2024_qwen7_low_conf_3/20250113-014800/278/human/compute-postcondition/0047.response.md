Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial Variables:
- `n`: An integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m`: An integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c`: An integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `components`: The result of the function `func_1(n, edges)`.
- `min_cost`: Initially set to infinity (`float('inf')`).

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(len(components)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
        cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2
        cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Inner Loop (j) and Outer Loop (i):**
   - The outer loop runs from `0` to `len(components) - 1`.
   - For each `i`, the inner loop runs from `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`.

2. **Variables Inside the Loop:**
   - `cost_i`: The square of the number of elements in `components[i]`.
   - `cost_j`: The square of the number of elements in `components[j]`.
   - `min_cost`: Updated to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop finishes, `min_cost` will hold the minimum value of `cost_i + cost_j + c` where `i` and `j` are indices of `components` such that `i < j`.
   - The value of `i` and `j` do not matter for the final value of `min_cost`, but they indicate that the loop has iterated through all possible pairs of components.

### Output State After All Iterations:
Since the loop will iterate through all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and update `min_cost` accordingly, the final state will be:

Output State: **`min_cost` is the minimum value of `len(components[i]) ** 2 + len(components[j]) ** 2 + c` computed over all pairs `(i, j)` such that `0 â‰¤ i < j < len(components)`.**
