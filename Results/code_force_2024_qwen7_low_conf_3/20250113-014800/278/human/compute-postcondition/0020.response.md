State before the loop starts: `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was previously less than `len(components)`) and `i` must be less than `len(components)`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop will iterate over the range from `i + 1` to `len(components)`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `i + 1` must be less than `len(components)`, otherwise the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.
3. Given that `i` was previously less than `len(components)`, the new value of `i` should still be valid for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the initial condition `i < len(components)` holds true after incrementing `i` by 1.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `len(components)`**
