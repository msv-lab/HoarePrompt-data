The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(u_i, v_i)` represents a bi-directional corridor between cells `u_i` and `v_i`.

The function has two possible return values:

- Case_1: The program returns `-1`.
- Case_2: The program returns `min_cost`, which is the minimum value of `len(components[i])`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`, and return either `-1` or the minimum value of the length of components based on certain conditions related to the prison cells and corridors.
