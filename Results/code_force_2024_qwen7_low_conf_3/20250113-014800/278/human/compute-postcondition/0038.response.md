Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `i` is less than `len(components)`
   - `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`
   - `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`
   - `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`

2. **Analyze the for loop**: The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `len(components)`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(components)`.
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, the condition for the next iteration will be `i + 1 <= j < len(components)`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` remains the same as it is not incremented or modified within the loop.
   - `cost_i` remains `len(components[i])` as it is not updated.
   - `cost_j` needs to be updated to `len(components[j])` for the next iteration.
   - `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `cost_i` remains the same.
   - `cost_j` changes to `len(components[j])` where `j` is now `i + 1`.
   - `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[i + 1])`, `min_cost` is the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
