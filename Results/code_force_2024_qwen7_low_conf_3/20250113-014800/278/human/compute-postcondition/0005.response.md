According to the code, the loop can execute if `len(components)` is at least 1. The initial states provided are:

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `components` is the result of the function `func_1(n, edges)`.
- `min_cost` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`).

For the loop to execute, `components` must have at least one element, meaning `len(components)` must be greater than 0.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

1. Ensure `components` is a non-empty list (i.e., `len(components) > 0`).
2. Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `components`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `components` must be a non-empty list.
- `i` is implicitly set to 0 at the start of the loop.

The final answer is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`)**
