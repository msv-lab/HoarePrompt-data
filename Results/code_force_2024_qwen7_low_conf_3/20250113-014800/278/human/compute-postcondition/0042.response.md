According to the given code, the loop condition for the `for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):` statement is based on the value of `j`. Specifically, the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(components)` and `j > i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is less than `len(components)`
- `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`
- `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`
- `min_cost` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `j` should be such that `j + 1 < len(components)` and `j + 1 > i`.

Given the above conditions, let's step through the process:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was set to some value such that `i + 1 <= j < len(components)`.
2. For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` remains the same (no change in `i`).
- `cost_i` remains `len(components[i])`.
- `cost_j` will now be `len(components[j+1])`.
- `min_cost` remains the same since it is only updated based on the values of `cost_i` and `cost_j` within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is less than `len(components)`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j + 1])`, `min_cost` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
