The code `min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)` impacts the `min_cost` variable by updating it to the minimum value between its current value and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`. Here, `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[i]` and `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is less than the length of `components`
- `n` is an integer (though it's not used in the code)
- `m` is an integer (though it's not used in the code)
- `c` is an integer
- `components` is a non-empty list
- `min_cost` is `float('inf')`

After executing the code, `min_cost` will be updated to the minimum of its current value (`float('inf'`) or the value of `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

Since `min_cost` was initially set to `float('inf')`, it will be updated to `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is less than the length of `components`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `components` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j]`**.
