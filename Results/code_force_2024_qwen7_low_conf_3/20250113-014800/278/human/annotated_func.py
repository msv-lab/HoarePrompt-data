    #`The program returns the list containing all the connected components of the graph`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of prison cells) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing bidirectional corridors between cells). It constructs a graph from the given edges and then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to identify all connected components within the graph. The function returns a list of these connected components. 

Specifically, the function performs the following actions:
1. It initializes a graph using a defaultdict, where each key is a cell and the value is a list of cells directly connected to it via the given corridors.
2. It initializes a `visited` list to keep track of which cells have been explored.
3. It iterates over each cell from 1 to `n`, performing BFS on unvisited cells to find all connected components.
4. It returns a list of all identified connected components.

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If there are no edges, the graph will be a set of isolated nodes, and each node will be a separate connected component.
- If all cells are interconnected, there will be only one connected component, which includes all cells.
- The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and that the edges are valid (i.e., they connect cells within the range 1 to `n`).

Missing functionality: The annotations suggest that the code constructs the graph and identifies connected components, but the provided code snippet does not explicitly include the BFS implementation. Therefore, it is implied that the BFS is correctly implemented elsewhere in the function, but this is not shown in the given code snippet.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `start` is an integer representing the starting node in the graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency list where `graph` is a dictionary mapping each node to a list of its neighbors, and `visited` is a boolean list of the same length as the number of nodes, initially set to `False`.
def bfs(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    component = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        if not visited[node]:
            visited[node] = True
            component.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `component` contains all nodes in the connected component of `start` in the graph `graph`, and `visited[node]` is True for all nodes in `component`.
    return component
    #`The program returns the set of nodes in the connected component of 'start' in the graph 'graph'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs(start)` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a graph starting from the node `start`. It initializes a queue with the starting node and iteratively explores all nodes in the connected component of `start`. During this process, it marks nodes as visited and adds them to the `component` list. The function returns a list containing all nodes in the connected component of `start`. If the starting node `start` is not present in the graph, or if the graph is empty, the function will still execute without errors but may return an empty list. The function does not handle cases where the graph contains isolated nodes that are not reachable from `start`.

    components = func_1(n, edges)

The number of components in `components` is greater than 1
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(components)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
            cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2
            cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_cost` is the minimum value of `len(components[i])
    return min_cost
    #The program returns min_cost which is the minimum value of len(components[i])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(u_i, v_i)` represents a bi-directional corridor between cells `u_i` and `v_i`.

The function first calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of connected components in the graph formed by the prison cells and corridors. If there is only one connected component, the function returns `-1`, indicating that all cells are already connected and no additional corridors need to be built.

If there are multiple connected components, the function calculates the minimum cost required to connect all components into a single connected component. It does this by iterating over all pairs of components and calculating the cost of connecting them, which is given by the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two components plus the cost `c` to build a single corridor. The function then returns the minimum cost found among all pairs of components.

The function can return either `-1` if all cells are already connected, or the minimum cost required to connect all cells if there are multiple connected components.
