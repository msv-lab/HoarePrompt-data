### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The provided program defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and an unnamed `bfs` function within `func_1`.
   - `func_1` constructs a graph and performs BFS to find all connected components in the graph.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to determine the number of connected components and calculates the minimum cost to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.

2. **`func_1` Function**:
   - This function constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph.
   - It performs BFS to find all connected components.
   - The function returns the list of connected components.

3. **`func_2` Function**:
   - This function takes `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges` as inputs.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the list of connected components.
   - If there is only one connected component, it returns `-1` because it is impossible to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost required to connect all components into a single connected component by considering every pair of components, computing the cost for each pair, and keeping track of the minimum cost found.
   - The cost for a pair of components is the sum of their sizes squared plus the cost `c` of the single connecting corridor.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly, including the checks for the number of components and ensuring that the input is valid.
   - The algorithm considers all pairs of components, which is necessary to find the minimum cost.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the minimum cost required to divide the prison as per the Ministry's requirements or `-1` if no such division is possible.

6. **Validation Using Function Summaries**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` matches the provided logic. It correctly describes how the function works, including the use of `func_1` to determine connected components and the calculation of the minimum cost.
   - The function summary also correctly mentions the handling of edge cases and the consideration of all pairs of components.

Based on the analysis, the program logic and the function summaries align with the problem description and the expected behavior. The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
