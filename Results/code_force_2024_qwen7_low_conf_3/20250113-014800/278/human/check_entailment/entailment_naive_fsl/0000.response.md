Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the graph is a single connected component. Specifically, the `func_1` function returns a list of components, but it does not properly track the state of the `visited` array across different calls. This leads to incorrect component detection in cases where the graph is a single connected component.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 6 5
4 3
2 3
2 4
1 2
4 1
3 1
```

The graph is a single connected component, and the program should return `-1` because it is not possible to divide it into two separate complexes. However, due to the issue with the `visited` array being shared across multiple calls to `bfs`, the program incorrectly finds multiple components, leading to a wrong result.

To fix this, the `visited` array should be reset before each call to `bfs` within the `func_1` function. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def func_1(n, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = []

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            comp = bfs(i, visited, graph)
            components.append(comp)
    return components

def bfs(start, visited, graph):
    queue = deque([start])
    component = []
    visited[start] = True
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return component
```

This corrected version ensures that the `visited` array is reset before each call to `bfs`, allowing the function to correctly detect the single connected component in the graph.
