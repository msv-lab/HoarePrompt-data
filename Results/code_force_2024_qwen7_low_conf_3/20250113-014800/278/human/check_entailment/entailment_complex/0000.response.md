Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly constructs a graph using the given edges and identifies all connected components in the graph. This is crucial for understanding the structure of the prison and how cells are connected.
2. **Function `bfs`**: This function correctly performs a BFS to find all nodes in a connected component starting from a given node. This helps in identifying the individual components.
3. **Function `func_2`**: 
   - **Initialization**: It correctly calls `func_1` to get the list of connected components.
   - **Edge Case Handling**: If there is only one connected component, it correctly returns `-1` because it's not possible to divide the prison into two separate complexes.
   - **Cost Calculation**: It correctly calculates the minimum cost required to connect the components by considering all pairs of components and summing their sizes squared plus the cost `c` to build a single corridor. This logic aligns with the problem statement.
   
Given the problem description and the annotated functions, the program correctly implements the solution logic. It accurately identifies connected components, handles the edge case where all cells are already connected, and computes the minimum cost to connect the components as specified.

Correctness: **True**
