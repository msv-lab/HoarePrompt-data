Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function `func_1` and `bfs` Implementation**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `bfs` are correctly implemented and serve their intended purpose of finding connected components in the graph. However, they are not used correctly within the context of the problem.
   - The `func_1` function returns the list of all connected components, but this information is not utilized in the final calculation of the minimum funding.

2. **Function `func_2` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the minimum funding by iterating over all pairs of connected components and considering the cost of connecting them with a single corridor. However, the logic for calculating the minimum funding is incorrect.
   - Specifically, the function does not account for the fact that the total funding includes the cost of building the necessary corridors to connect the two components. It only considers the cost of the corridor itself without including the cost of making the two components connected.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the graph is fully connected and cannot be divided into two components with exactly one corridor connecting them.

To correct the program, you need to:
1. Ensure that the graph is fully explored and all connected components are identified.
2. Calculate the minimum funding by considering the cost of building corridors to connect different components.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def func_1(n, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            components.append(bfs(i, graph, visited))
    
    return components

def bfs(start, graph, visited):
    queue = deque([start])
    component = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if not visited[node]:
            visited[node] = True
            component.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    return component

def func_2(n, m, c, edges):
    components = func_1(n, edges)
    
    if len(components) <= 1:
        return -1
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(components)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
            cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2
            cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2
            # Find the minimum cost to connect components i and j
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)
    
    return min_cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, c) = map(int, input().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    print(func_2(n, m, c, edges))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies all connected components and calculates the minimum funding required to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one corridor connecting them.
