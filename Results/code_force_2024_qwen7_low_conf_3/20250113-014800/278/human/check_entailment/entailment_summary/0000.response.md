Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to divide the prison into two complexes such that exactly one corridor connects them.
   - The funding required for a complex \( S \) consisting of \( k \) cells is \( k^2 \).
   - We need to minimize the total funding, which includes the funding for the two complexes and the corridors built.

2. **Analyzing the Given Functions**:
   - **func_1** constructs the graph and identifies all connected components using BFS.
   - **bfs** is a helper function that performs BFS to find a connected component starting from a given node.
   - **func_2** calculates the minimum funding required to connect the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.

3. **Verification of Correctness**:
   - **func_1** correctly identifies all connected components in the graph.
   - **bfs** correctly performs BFS to find connected components.
   - **func_2** correctly identifies multiple connected components and calculates the minimum funding required to connect them.

4. **Edge Cases and Considerations**:
   - If there is only one connected component, the function correctly returns `-1` as no additional corridors can be built.
   - The function correctly handles cases where there are multiple connected components and calculates the minimum cost to connect them.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It accurately identifies connected components and calculates the minimum funding required to connect them.

Correctness: **True**
