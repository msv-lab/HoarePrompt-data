# Problem:
In the hard version, 2 \leq \sum n \leq 10^5 and 1 \leq \sum m \leq 5 \times
10^{5}

After a worker's strike organized by the Dementors asking for equal rights,
the prison of Azkaban has suffered some damage. After settling the spirits,
the Ministry of Magic is looking to renovate the prison to ensure that the
Dementors are kept in check. The prison consists of n prison cells and m bi-
directional corridors. The i^{th} corridor is from cells u_i to v_i . A subset
of these cells S is called a complex if any cell in S is reachable from any
other cell in S . Formally, a subset of cells S is a complex if x and y are
reachable from each other for all x, y \in S , using only cells from S on the
way. The funding required for a complex S consisting of k cells is defined as
k^2 .

As part of your Intro to Magical Interior Design course at Hogwarts, you have
been tasked with designing the prison. The Ministry of Magic has asked that
you divide the prison into 2 complexes with \textbf{exactly one corridor}
connecting them, so that the Dementors can't organize union meetings. For this
purpose, you are allowed to build bi-directional corridors. The funding
required to build a corridor between any 2 cells is c .

Due to budget cuts and the ongoing fight against the Death Eaters, you must
find the \textbf{minimum total funding} required to divide the prison as per
the Ministry's requirements or -1 if no division is possible.

Note: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the 2 complexes
and the corridors built. If after the division, the two complexes have x and y
cells respectively and you have built a total of a corridors, the total
funding will be x^2 + y^2 + c \times a . Note that x+y=n .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^5 ) — the number of
test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers n, m and c (2 \leq
n \leq 10^5 , 1 \leq m \leq 5 \times 10^{5} , 1 \leq c \leq 10^9 )

m lines follow, each consisting of 2 integers — u_i, v_i indicating a corridor
is present between cells u_i and v_i (1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n , u_i \neq v_i )

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 5
\times 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that there exists at most one corridor between any two cells.

Output

Print the \textbf{minimum funding} required to divide the prison as per the
Ministry's requirements or -1 if no division is possible.

Note

In the first test case of the sample input, there is no way to divide the
prison according to the Ministry's requirements.

In the second test case, consider the corridor between cells 1 and 5 as the
connection between the 2 complexes consisting of \\{2, 3, 5, 6\\} and \\{1,
4\\} cells respectively. There are no new corridors built. The total funding
is 4^2 + 2^2 = 20 . You can verify this is the minimum funding required.

In the third test case, build a corridor between 2 and 4 . Consider the
corridor between cells 1 and 5 as the connection between the 2 complexes
consisting of \\{3, 5, 6\\} and \\{1, 2, 4\\} cells respectively. The total
funding is 3^2 + 3^2 + 7 \times 1 = 25 . You can verify this is the minimum
funding required.

In the fourth test case, build a corridor between 2 and 4 and between 5 and 7
. Consider the corridor between cells 5 and 7 as the connection between the 2
complexes consisting of \\{1, 2, 4, 7\\} and \\{3, 5, 6\\} cells respectively.
The total funding is 4^2 + 3^2 + 4 \times 2 = 33 . You can verify this is the
minimum funding required.

Note for all test cases that there may be multiple ways to get the same
funding but there is no other division which will have a more optimal minimum
funding.

# Functions with Execution Summary:

    edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of prison cells) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing bidirectional corridors between cells). It constructs a graph from the given edges and then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to identify all connected components within the graph. The function returns a list of these connected components. 

Specifically, the function performs the following actions:
1. It initializes a graph using a defaultdict, where each key is a cell and the value is a list of cells directly connected to it via the given corridors.
2. It initializes a `visited` list to keep track of which cells have been explored.
3. It iterates over each cell from 1 to `n`, performing BFS on unvisited cells to find all connected components.
4. It returns a list of all identified connected components.

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If there are no edges, the graph will be a set of isolated nodes, and each node will be a separate connected component.
- If all cells are interconnected, there will be only one connected component, which includes all cells.
- The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and that the edges are valid (i.e., they connect cells within the range 1 to `n`).

Missing functionality: The annotations suggest that the code constructs the graph and identifies connected components, but the provided code snippet does not explicitly include the BFS implementation. Therefore, it is implied that the BFS is correctly implemented elsewhere in the function, but this is not shown in the given code snippet.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def bfs(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    component = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if not visited[node]:
            visited[node] = True

            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    return component
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `bfs(start)` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a graph starting from the node `start`. It initializes a queue with the starting node and iteratively explores all nodes in the connected component of `start`. During this process, it marks nodes as visited and adds them to the `component` list. The function returns a list containing all nodes in the connected component of `start`. If the starting node `start` is not present in the graph, or if the graph is empty, the function will still execute without errors but may return an empty list. The function does not handle cases where the graph contains isolated nodes that are not reachable from `start`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, m, c, edges):
    components = func_1(n, edges)
    if len(components) == 1:
        return -1
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(components)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
            cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2
            cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)
    return min_cost
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(u_i, v_i)` represents a bi-directional corridor between cells `u_i` and `v_i`.

The function first calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of connected components in the graph formed by the prison cells and corridors. If there is only one connected component, the function returns `-1`, indicating that all cells are already connected and no additional corridors need to be built.

If there are multiple connected components, the function calculates the minimum cost required to connect all components into a single connected component. It does this by iterating over all pairs of components and calculating the cost of connecting them, which is given by the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two components plus the cost `c` to build a single corridor. The function then returns the minimum cost found among all pairs of components.

The function can return either `-1` if all cells are already connected, or the minimum cost required to connect all cells if there are multiple connected components.
