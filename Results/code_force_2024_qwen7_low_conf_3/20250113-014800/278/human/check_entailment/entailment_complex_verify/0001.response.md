### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The provided program defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and an unnamed `bfs` function within `func_1`.

2. **`func_1` Function**:
   - This function takes `n` and `edges` as inputs.
   - It constructs a graph using adjacency lists and performs BFS to find all connected components in the graph.
   - Each connected component is stored in the `components` list.
   - The function returns the list of connected components.
   - **Annotation Analysis**: The annotations accurately describe the behavior of this function.

3. **`func_2` Function**:
   - This function takes `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges` as inputs.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the list of connected components.
   - If there is only one connected component, it returns `-1` because it is impossible to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost required to divide the prison into two complexes by considering every pair of connected components, computing the cost for each pair, and keeping track of the minimum cost found.
     - **Cost Calculation**: The cost for a pair of components is the sum of their sizes squared plus the cost `c` of the single connecting corridor.
   - **Annotation Analysis**: The annotations accurately describe the behavior of this function. However, there is a minor issue with the loop bounds in the `for` loop within `func_2`. The loop should iterate from `i` to `len(components) - 1` instead of `i + 1` to `len(components)` to avoid missing the last component.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly, including the checks for the number of components and ensuring that the input is valid.
   - The algorithm considers all pairs of components, which is necessary to find the minimum cost.
   - **Annotation Analysis**: The constraints and handling of edge cases are correctly described.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the minimum cost required to divide the prison as per the Ministry's requirements or `-1` if no such division is possible.
   - **Annotation Analysis**: The output is correctly described.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the provided problem statement and the corrected logic in `func_2` (specifically the loop bounds), the program correctly implements the solution. The original assessment missed the detail about the loop bounds, but otherwise, it accurately described the program's behavior.

**Final: True**
