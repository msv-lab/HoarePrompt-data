### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description, the annotated code, and the original assessment.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Handling Single Connected Component**: The original assessment correctly pointed out that the `visited` array is not being reset across calls to `bfs` within `func_1`. This leads to incorrect component detection when the graph is a single connected component, causing the program to return a wrong result.

2. **Functionality of `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - `func_1` constructs the graph and uses BFS to find connected components.
   - `func_2` calculates the minimum cost to connect the components if there are multiple.

3. **Revised `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The revised version of `func_1` correctly resets the `visited` array before each call to `bfs`.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - If there is only one connected component, the function should return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it should calculate the minimum cost to connect the components.

Given the revised implementation of `func_1` and the original logic of `func_2`, the program should now correctly handle the cases where the graph is a single connected component.

### Evaluation:

1. **Correctness of Revised `func_1`**:
   - The revised `func_1` correctly handles the single connected component case by resetting the `visited` array before each call to `bfs`.

2. **Functionality of `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum cost if there are multiple components, and returns `-1` if there is only one component.

3. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The program now correctly handles all cases described in the problem statement.

Given the revised implementation and the original logic, the program now accurately solves the problem as specified.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is now correct after the revisions, and it accurately handles all cases including the single connected component scenario.
