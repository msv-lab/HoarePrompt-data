You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        n = len(ab)
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `ab` is the final list of characters from the last input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' characters in `ab`. If `a > b`, the message 'A' has been printed to the console for the last iteration. Otherwise, the message 'B' has been printed to the console for the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Conversion**: It converts the input string into a list of characters using a list comprehension, which is a standard and efficient way to handle the string.
3. **Counting Characters**: The program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string by iterating through the list and incrementing counters accordingly.
4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the character that appears more frequently.
5. **Edge Cases**: Since the input strings are guaranteed to be of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', the logic handles all possible scenarios without errors.
6. **Output Format**: The program outputs the expected letter for each test case, adhering to the specified format.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the provided program correctly solves the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
