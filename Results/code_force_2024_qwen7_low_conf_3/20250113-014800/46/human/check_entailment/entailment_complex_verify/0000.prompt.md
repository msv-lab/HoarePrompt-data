You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        n = len(ab)
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `ab` is the final list of characters from the last input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' characters in `ab`. If `a > b`, the message 'A' has been printed to the console for the last iteration. Otherwise, the message 'B' has been printed to the console for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` input strings, each of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each input string, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. After processing all strings, it prints 'A' if the total count of 'A' characters is greater than the total count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value. It handles the case where `t` is between 1 and 32 inclusive.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string of length 5 and prints the character that appears most frequently. Since the program handles all possible inputs as per the problem description and there are no edge cases that could make it fail, the program is correct.
