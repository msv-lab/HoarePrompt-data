### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Conversion**: It converts the input string into a list of characters using a list comprehension, which is a standard and efficient way to handle the string.
3. **Counting Characters**: The program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string by iterating through the list and incrementing counters accordingly.
4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the character that appears more frequently.
5. **Edge Cases**: Since the input strings are guaranteed to be of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', the logic handles all possible scenarios without errors.
6. **Output Format**: The program outputs the expected letter for each test case, adhering to the specified format.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the provided program correctly solves the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
