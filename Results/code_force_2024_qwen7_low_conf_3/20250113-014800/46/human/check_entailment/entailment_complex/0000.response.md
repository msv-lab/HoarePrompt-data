Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading a string of length 5 and counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
3. After counting the occurrences for each string, it prints 'A' if there are more 'A's than 'B's, and 'B' otherwise.
4. The function handles all test cases correctly without any logical errors.
5. The program logic matches the problem description and the provided example.

Given the above reasoning:

Correctness: **True**
