You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `ab` is the final list of characters from the last input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' characters in `ab`. If `a > b`, the message 'A' has been printed to the console for the last iteration. Otherwise, the message 'B' has been printed to the console for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` input strings, each of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each input string, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. After processing all strings, it prints 'A' if the total count of 'A' characters is greater than the total count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value. It handles the case where `t` is between 1 and 32 inclusive.
