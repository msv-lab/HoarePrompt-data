Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer equal to the input integer.
   - `ab` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - If `ab[i]` is 'A', then `a` is 1, otherwise `b` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - The loop condition checks if `i < n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1 (since it must be).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, `i = 1` will still satisfy this condition.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
   - The values of `t` and `ab` remain the same since the loop body is omitted.

6. **Final State:**
   - `t` is an integer equal to the input integer.
   - `ab` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
