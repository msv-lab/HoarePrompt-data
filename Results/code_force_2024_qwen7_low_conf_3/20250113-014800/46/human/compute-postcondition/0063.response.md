`a` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `a` is not specified in the initial state. Since no specific value for `a` is given, we only know that `a` has been incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `ab` is `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`, `n` is 4, `i` is 4, `a` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `ab` is `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`, `n` is 4, `i` is 4, `a` is increased by 1**
