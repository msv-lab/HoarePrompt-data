The value of `a` is incremented by 1, and since `a` was not defined before, it is implicitly assigned the value of `i` which is initially 1. Therefore, after the line `a += 1`, the value of `a` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `ab`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is 2**
