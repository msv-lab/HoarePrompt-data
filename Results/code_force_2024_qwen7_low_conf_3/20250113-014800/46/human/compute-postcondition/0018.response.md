`b` is incremented by 1, and the value of `t` remains as an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` remains as a list of characters from the input string, and `i` remains as 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is also still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` is 1, `b` is increased by 1, and n must be greater than 1.**
