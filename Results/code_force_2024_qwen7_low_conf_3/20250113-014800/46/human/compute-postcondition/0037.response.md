Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
   - `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `ab[i] == 'A'`, then `a` is 1 and `b` is 0; otherwise, `a` is 0 and `b` is 1.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs based on the variable `i` in the range `range(n)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Determine Changes at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is used as the index in the range, it increases by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 from its value at the start of the previous iteration.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `t` remains `t - 1` and must still be greater than 0.
   - `ab` remains the same list of characters.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - If `ab[i]` was checked in the previous iteration, we need to update `i` to `i + 1` for the next iteration.

Given the above steps, the updated states at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- If `ab[i+1] == 'A'`, then `a` is 1 and `b` is 0; otherwise, `a` is 0 and `b` is 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, if `ab[i+1] == 'A'`, then `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, otherwise `a` is 0 and `b` is 1.**
