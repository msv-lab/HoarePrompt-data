`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The input is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive). The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.**
