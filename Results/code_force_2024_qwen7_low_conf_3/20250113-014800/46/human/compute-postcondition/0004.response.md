The variable `a` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `t`, `ab`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is `0`**
