`b` is incremented by 1, so its new value is the original value of `b` plus 1. The original value of `b` was 0, so now `b` is 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `ab[i]` is not 'A'**
