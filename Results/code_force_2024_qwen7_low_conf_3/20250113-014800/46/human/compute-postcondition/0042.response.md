`a` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `a` was previously set based on the character at `ab[i]` and `ab[i+1]`. Since `a` is increased by 1, the only change is in the value of `a`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i + 1 < n`, if `ab[i+1] == 'A'`, then `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, otherwise `a` is 0 and `b` is 1; if `ab[i] == 'A'`, then `a` is increased by 1, otherwise `b` is increased by 1; `a` is increased by 1.**
