`a` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` remains `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is 0, and the current value of `i` is such that `ab[i] == 'A'`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, the current value of `i` is such that `ab[i] == 'A'`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, the current value of `i` is such that `ab[i] == 'A'`**
