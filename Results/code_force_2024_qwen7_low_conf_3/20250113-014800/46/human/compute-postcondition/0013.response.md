`a` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `a` is not specified in the initial state. However, since `a` is not defined before the increment, it implies that `a` was 0 before this line of code. Therefore, after executing `a += 1`, `a` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is 1**
