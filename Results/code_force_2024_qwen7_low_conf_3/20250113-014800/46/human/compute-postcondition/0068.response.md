`b` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `b` is not specified in the initial state. However, since no other variable values are affected, we can only state that `b` is increased by 1. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `ab` is `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`, `n` is 4, `b` is increased by 1**
