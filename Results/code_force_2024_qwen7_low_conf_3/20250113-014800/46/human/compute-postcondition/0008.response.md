`a` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the `i-th` character in `ab` is 'A' remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, and the current value of `i` satisfies that the `i-th` character in `ab` is 'A'**
