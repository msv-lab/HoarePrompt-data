`b` is incremented by 1. The previous condition that `ab[i+1] == 'A'` implies `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, and `ab[i] == 'A'` implies `a` is increased by 1, otherwise `b` is increased by 1, remains unchanged. The value of `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 0 and `i + 1 < n`. 

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i + 1 < n`, `b` is increased by 1, if `ab[i+1] == 'A'`, then `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, otherwise `a` is 0 and `b` is 1; if `ab[i] == 'A'`, then `a` is increased by 1, otherwise `b` is increased by 1**
