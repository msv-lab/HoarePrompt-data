The variable `b` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `b` is not specified in the initial state. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `b` and retains the other variables from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `ab` is ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B'], `n` is 4, `i` is 4, `b` is 1**
