`b` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `b` is 0, so after executing `b += 1`, the value of `b` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `ab` is `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`, `n` is 4, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `i` is 0, and `ab[i]` is not equal to 'A'**
