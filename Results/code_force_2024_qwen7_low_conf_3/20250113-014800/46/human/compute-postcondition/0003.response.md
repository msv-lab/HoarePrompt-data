The code calculates the length of the list `ab` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The length of the list `ab` is stored in `n`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`**
