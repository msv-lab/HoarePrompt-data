`a` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `a` is unknown. The conditions for `t`, `ab`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, if `ab[i+1] == 'A'`, then `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, otherwise `a` is 0 and `b` is 1; `a` is increased by 1.
