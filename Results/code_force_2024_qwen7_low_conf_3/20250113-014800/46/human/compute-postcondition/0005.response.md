The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `b`. The variable `t` remains an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` remains a list of characters from the input string, `n` remains the length of `ab`, and `a` remains `0`. Therefore, the only change is that `b` is now `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is `0`, `b` is `0`**
