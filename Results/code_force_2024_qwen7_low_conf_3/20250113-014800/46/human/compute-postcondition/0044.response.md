Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i + 1 < n`. If `ab[i] == 'A'`, then `a` is increased by 1, otherwise `b` is increased by 1. Regardless of whether the condition `ab[i] == 'A'` is true, `a` is either increased by 1 or `b` is increased by 1, and `ab[i+1]` is handled according to its value to update `a` and `b` accordingly.***
