Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `ab` is `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`.
   - `n` is 4.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, if `ab[i]` equals 'A', then `a` is set to 1 and `b` remains 0.
   - Otherwise, `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 1.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `ab` remains `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`.
   - `n` remains 4.
   - The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration can be determined based on the loop logic.

4. **Determine `i` at End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `n` is 4, the loop will iterate 4 times.
   - Let's consider the possible values of `i` at the end of the previous iteration:
     - If the loop just finished its last iteration, `i` would be 3.
     - If the loop finished before the last iteration, we need to check the condition of the loop body to determine the exact value of `i`.

5. **Assume the Loop Just Finished Its Last Iteration:**
   - If the loop just finished its last iteration, `i` would be 3.
   - We need to check the value of `a` and `b` at this point:
     - If `ab[3]` is 'B', then `a` would remain 0 and `b` would be 1.
     - If `ab[3]` is 'A', then `a` would be 1 and `b` would remain 0.

6. **State at Start of Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n` (which is 4).
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be 4 for the loop to execute again.
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `ab` remains `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`.
   - `n` remains 4.

7. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `ab` remains `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`.
   - `n` remains 4.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `ab` is `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`, `n` is 4, `i` is 4**
