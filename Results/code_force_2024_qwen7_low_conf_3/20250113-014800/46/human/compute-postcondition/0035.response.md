`b` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `ab[i]` is not equal to 'A'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ab` is a list of characters from the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `ab[i]` is not equal to 'A'**
