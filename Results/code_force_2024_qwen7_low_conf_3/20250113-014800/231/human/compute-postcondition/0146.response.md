The code `res.append(val)` appends the value of `val` to the list `res`. Given the initial state and the definition of `val`, let's calculate the new state.

Initial State:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `n + m` must be greater than 0
- `res` is recalculated for `i = 3`
- If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is `ans - a[types[3]][3] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`.
- Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[3]][3] + a[types[3]][n + m]`

Since `res.append(val)` is called, `val` is added to the list `res`. However, the exact value of `val` depends on the conditions given. Let's assume the conditions are met (or not) and derive the value of `val`.

If the conditions are met:
- `val` is `ans - a[types[3]][3] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`

If the conditions are not met:
- `val` is `ans - a[types[3]][3] + a[types[3]][n + m]`

In both cases, `val` is calculated and appended to `res`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `res` contains `val` (either `ans - a[types[3]][3] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[3]][3] + a[types[3]][n + m]`), `res` is recalculated for `i = 3`**
