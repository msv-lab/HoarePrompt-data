The line of code `curType = 1 - curType` changes the value of `curType` from its original value. Initially, `curType` is set to 1. After executing `curType = 1 - curType`, `curType` will be updated to `1 - 1`, which results in `0`. 

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, and `cur[curType]`) remain unchanged based on the given initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, and `curType` is 0. The current value of `cur[curType]` equals the value of `bounds[0]`.**
