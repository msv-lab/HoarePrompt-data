The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Since `types[i]` can be either 1 or 0, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `types[i]` is 1, then `cur[1]` is incremented by 1.
2. If `types[i]` is 0, then `cur[0]` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial conditions:
- `curType` is either 1 or 0.
- `n + m` is greater than 0.
- `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`.
- `types[i]` is either 1 or 0.
- `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`.
- If `bad == -1`, then `bad` is equal to `i` and `badType` is either 0 or 1; otherwise, no changes occur.

The only change is in the variable `cur[types[i]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1.
- All other variables remain as they were initially.

Output State: **`curType` is either 1 or 0; `n + m` is greater than 0; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `types[i]` is either 1 or 0; `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`; if `bad == -1`, then `bad` is equal to `i` and `badType` is either 0 or 1; `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1.**
