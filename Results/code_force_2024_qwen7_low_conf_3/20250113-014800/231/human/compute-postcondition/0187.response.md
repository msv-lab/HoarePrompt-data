The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given that `types[i]` is 0, this means `cur[0]` is incremented by 1.

From the initial state:
- `ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][i]`
- `curType` is 0
- `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`
- `types[i]` is 0

Since `curType` is 0 and `types[i]` is also 0, `cur[0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur[0]` was initially `bounds[0] + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][i]`, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`, `types[i]` is 0**
