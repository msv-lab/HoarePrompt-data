Postcondition: ***`cur` is [0, 1], `curType` is 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is 0; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0; if `bad == -1`, then `bad` is `i` and `badType` is 0 if `curType` is 1, and `badType` is 1 if `curType` is 0. There is no change in the `types` list since there is no else part in the code block.***
