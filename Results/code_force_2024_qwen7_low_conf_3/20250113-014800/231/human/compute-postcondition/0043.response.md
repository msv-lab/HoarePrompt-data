The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bad`. This means that `bad` is now equal to `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 2]; `curType` is the opposite of its original value; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i + 1` which is equal to 1; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i + 1]`; `bad` is equal to `i`.**
