The code `res = []` initializes an empty list `res`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `res`.

Output State: **`n + m` is a non-negative integer, `res` is an empty list [], `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user.**
