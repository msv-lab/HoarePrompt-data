Let's break down the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `i` is an input integer.
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m` is at least the number of iterations.
   - `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + number of iterations`.
   - `curType` alternates between 0 and 1 based on the conditions.
   - `types` list is filled with alternating values of 0 and 1.
   - `bad` is the index where the condition `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` fails first (if it fails).
   - `badType` is the opposite of `curType` when the failure occurs.
   - `cur` is updated for each `curType` based on the loop execution.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n + m - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n + m` must be at least the number of iterations required. This means `n + m` should be non-zero.

3. **Variables that Need Adjustments**:
   - `i`: It starts from 0 and goes up to `n + m - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be within this range for the loop to execute.
   - `n` and `m`: Since `n + m` must be at least the number of iterations, both `n` and `m` need to ensure their sum is at least 1. Thus, `n` and `m` must be such that their sum is at least 1.

4. **Summary**:
   - Ensure that the loop can start by setting `i` to 0.
   - Ensure that `n + m` is at least 1 so that the loop has at least one iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `n + m` being at least 1.

**State:**
- `res` is an empty list.
- `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for each iteration of the loop.
- `i` is set to 0.
- `n` and `m` must be such that `n + m` is at least 1.
- `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + number of iterations`.
- `curType` alternates between 0 and 1 based on the conditions.
- `types` list is filled with alternating values of 0 and 1.
- `bad` is the index where the condition `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` fails first (if it fails).
- `badType` is the opposite of `curType` when the failure occurs.
- `cur` is updated for each `curType` based on the loop execution.

State: **`res` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be such that `n + m` is at least 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + number of iterations`, `curType` alternates between 0 and 1 based on the conditions, `types` list is filled with alternating values of 0 and 1, `bad` is the index where the condition `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` fails first (if it fails), `badType` is the opposite of `curType` when the failure occurs, `cur` is updated for each `curType` based on the loop execution.**
