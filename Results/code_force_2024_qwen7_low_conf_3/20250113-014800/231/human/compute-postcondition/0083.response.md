The code assigns the value `[0, 0]` to the variable `cur`. This changes the value of `cur` from either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]` to `[0, 0]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `n + m` is a non-negative integer, `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with the new `ans` appended, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user.**
