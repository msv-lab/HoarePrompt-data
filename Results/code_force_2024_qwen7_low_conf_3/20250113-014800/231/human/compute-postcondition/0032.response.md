`badType` is assigned the value `1 - curType`. Since `curType` is 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is 0, `badType` will be 0 if `curType` is 1, and `badType` will be 1 if `curType` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 1]; `curType` is 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is 0; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0; `bad` is `i`; `badType` is 0 if `curType` is 1, and `badType` is 1 if `curType` is 0.**
