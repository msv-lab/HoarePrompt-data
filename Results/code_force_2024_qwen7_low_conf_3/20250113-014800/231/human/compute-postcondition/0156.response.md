The code assigns `-1` to the variable `bad`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `bad` is now `-1`, and all other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`i` is the new value of `int(input())`, `res` is a list of length `i+1`, `n` and `m` are updated by `map(int, input().split())`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing `i+1` lists, `res` is printed, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `i - 1`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1.**
