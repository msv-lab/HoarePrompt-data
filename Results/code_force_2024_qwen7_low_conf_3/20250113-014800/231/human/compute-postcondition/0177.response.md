The code sets `curType` to 0, which changes the value of `curType`. The previous value of `curType` was either 1 (if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`) or remained 1 otherwise. After setting `curType` to 0, the condition for `curType` will no longer be met in the next iteration. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + a[curType][i]`, `i` is an input integer + 1, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `curType` is 0, the `types` list has its `(i+1)`-th element set to `curType`.**
