Postcondition: ***`n + m` must be at least 1, `i` is increased by 1. If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is set to `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`, and `res` is a list with one additional element which is `val`. Otherwise, `val` is set to `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`, and `res` is a list with one additional element which is `val + a[types[i]][n + m]`.***
