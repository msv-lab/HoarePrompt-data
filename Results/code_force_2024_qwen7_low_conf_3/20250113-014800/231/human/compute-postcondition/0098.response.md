`types[i]` is assigned the value of `curType`. The value of `curType` is either 1 or 0, so `types[i]` will also be either 1 or 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`curType` is either 1 or 0; `n + m` is greater than 0; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `types[i]` is either 1 or 0; if `bad == -1`, then `bad` is equal to `i` and `badType` is either 0 or 1; otherwise, no changes occur.**
