The code changes the value of `curType` to its opposite. Since `curType` was previously defined as `1` if `a[0][i] < a[1][i]` and `0` otherwise, changing `curType` to `1 - curType` will flip its value. Therefore, if `curType` was `1`, it will become `0`, and if it was `0`, it will become `1`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `bounds` is `[n, m]`, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is extended by a list of integers obtained from user input, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0, `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0, `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < n + m\), `curType` is the opposite of its previous value.**
