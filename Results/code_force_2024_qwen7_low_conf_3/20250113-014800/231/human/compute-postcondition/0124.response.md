The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given that `types[i]` is either 0 or 1, this means one of the following will happen:

- If `types[i]` is 0, `cur[0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `types[i]` is 1, `cur[1]` is incremented by 1.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code snippet provided. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1.
- All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.

Output State: **`curType` is 0 or 1; if `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `curType` changes to its opposite; `n + m` remains greater than 0; `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`; `cur[types[i+2]]` is increased by 1; if `cur[curType] + 1` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is set to `i + 1` and `badType` is set to 1; otherwise, the original state is retained; `types[i+1]` is 1; `cur[1]` is increased by 1 if `types[i]` is 0, or `cur[0]` is increased by 1 if `types[i]` is 1; if `bad == -1`, then `bad` is set to `i` and `badType` is set to `1 - curType`; otherwise, the original state is retained; `types[i]` is either 0 or 1.**
