Output State: **`curType` is 0 or 1 (it changes from its original value to the opposite), `n + m` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `a[1][i+1]`, `cur[types[i+2]]` is increased by 1, if `cur[curType] + 1` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is set to `i + 1` and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise the original state is retained; `types[i+1]` is 1, `cur[1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `curType = 1 - curType` simply flips the value of `curType`. If `curType` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `curType` was 1, it becomes 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
