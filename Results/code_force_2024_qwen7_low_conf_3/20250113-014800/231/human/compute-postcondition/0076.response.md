The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This operation changes the values of `n` and `m` but does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n + m` is a non-negative integer
- `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with the new `ans` appended
- `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`
- `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`
- `bad` is the index where the type switch happened (or -1 if no switch occurred)
- `badType` is `1 - curType`
- `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`
- `curType` is the opposite of its original value

After executing the code, the following variables are updated:
- `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `n + m` is a non-negative integer, `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with the new `ans` appended, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is the index where the type switch happened (or -1 if no switch occurred), `badType` is `1 - curType`, `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value.**
