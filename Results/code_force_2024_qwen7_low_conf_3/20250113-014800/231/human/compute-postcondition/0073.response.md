The code snippet appends the value of `ans` to the list `res`. This means that the value of `ans` is added to the end of the list `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n + m` is a non-negative integer.
- `val` is calculated based on the final value of `ans`, `a[types[i]][i]`, `a[types[i]][n + m]`, `a[badType][bad]`, and `a[1 - badType][n + m]` according to the rules defined in the loop.
- `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements.
- `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`.
- `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`.
- `bad` is the index where the type switch happened (or -1 if no switch occurred).
- `badType` is `1 - curType`.
- `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`.
- `curType` is the opposite of its original value.

After executing the line `res.append(ans)`, the value of `ans` is appended to the list `res`.

Output State: **`n + m` is a non-negative integer; `val` is calculated based on the final value of `ans`, `a[types[i]][i]`, `a[types[i]][n + m]`, `a[badType][bad]`, and `a[1 - badType][n + m]` according to the rules defined in the loop; `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with `ans` appended to it; `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`; `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`; `bad` is the index where the type switch happened (or -1 if no switch occurred); `badType` is `1 - curType`; `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`; `curType` is the opposite of its original value.**
