The code `print(*res)` prints the elements of the list `res`. Since `res` is a list of length `n + m` with `ans` appended to it, printing this list will display its elements. However, the values of the individual elements in `res` are not altered by this print statement; they remain as they were before.

Output State: **`i` is `n + m`, `res` is a list of length `n + m` with `ans` appended to it, `n + m` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user, the list `res` is printed.**
