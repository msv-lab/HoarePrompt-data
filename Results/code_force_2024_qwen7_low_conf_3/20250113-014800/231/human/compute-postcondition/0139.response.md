Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `res` is `[]` with one additional element `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user, `val` is updated based on the following conditions: if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is `val + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`; otherwise, `val` is its original value plus `a[types[i]][n + m]`***
