The variable `curType` is assigned the value `1`. This changes the value of `curType` from its previous value (which was `0`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + a[curType][i]`, `i` is an input integer + 1, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `curType` is 1, the `types` list has its `(i+1)`-th element set to `curType`.**
