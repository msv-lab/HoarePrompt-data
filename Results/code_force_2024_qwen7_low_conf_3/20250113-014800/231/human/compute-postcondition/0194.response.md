The code sets `badType` to `1 - curType`. Given that `curType` is initially 0, `badType` will be set to 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][prev_i + 1]`, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0 if `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`; otherwise, it retains its initial value, `bad` is `i`, `badType` is 1**
