Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][i]`, meaning `ans` has already included the value `a[0][i]` from the previous iteration.
   - `curType` is 0.
   - `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`.
   - `types[i]` is 0.

2. **Loop Statement Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(n + m)`. This means the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n + m - 1`.

3. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `prev_i`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `prev_i + 1`.
   - The variable `curType` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - The variable `cur[0]` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - The variable `types[i]` needs to be updated to 0 for the new value of `i`.

Given these points, we can determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `ans` will include the value of `a[0][prev_i + 1]` from the next iteration.
- `curType` remains 0.
- `cur[0]` remains `bounds[0] + 2`.
- `types[prev_i + 1]` will be set to 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][prev_i + 1]`, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0**
