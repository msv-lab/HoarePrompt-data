Postcondition: ***`curType` is 0 or 1, `n + m` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `a[1][i+1]`, `cur[types[i+2]]` is increased by 1, if `cur[curType] + 1` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is set to `i + 1` and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise the original state is retained; `types[i+1]` is 1, `cur[1]` is increased by 1. This holds whether `a[0][i] < a[1][i]` is true or false.***
