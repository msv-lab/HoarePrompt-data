Postcondition: ***`t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `bounds` is `[n, m]`, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is extended by a list of integers obtained from user input, `bad` is either `-1` or `i`, `badType` is `0` when `bad` equals `i`, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is `0`, `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to `0`, `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < n + m\), and `curType` is `1` when `bad` does not equal `i` and `0` when `bad` equals `i`. If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, `bad` becomes `i` if `bad` was `-1`, otherwise `bad` remains unchanged. If `cur[curType] != bounds[curType]`, `bad` remains unchanged.***
