The initial state is as follows:
- `curType` is 1
- `n + m` is greater than 0
- `ans` is increased by `a[types[i+1]][i+1]`
- `cur[types[i+1]]` is increased by 1

The code snippet is:
```python
curType = 1 - curType
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `curType` is initially 1.
2. The expression `1 - curType` will evaluate to `1 - 1`, which results in 0.
3. This value is then assigned back to `curType`.

After executing the code, the updated value of `curType` is 0.

The other variables (`n + m`, `ans`, and `cur[types[i+1]]`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`curType` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `a[types[i+1]][i+1]`, and `cur[types[i+1]]` is increased by 1.**
