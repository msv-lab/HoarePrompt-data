The code `bad = i` assigns the value of `i` to `bad`. The value of `i` is an input integer, so `bad` now holds this value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals the value of `bounds[0]`, and `bad` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals the value of `bounds[0]`, and `bad` is equal to `i`.**
