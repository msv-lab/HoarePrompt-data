`curType` is updated to `1 - curType`, which means if `curType` was 0, it will become 1, and if it was 1, it will become 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 2]; `curType` is the opposite of its original value; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i + 1` which is equal to 1; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i + 1]`.**
