The code changes the value of `curType` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 2]; `curType` is 1; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i + 1` which is equal to 1; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i + 1]`.**
