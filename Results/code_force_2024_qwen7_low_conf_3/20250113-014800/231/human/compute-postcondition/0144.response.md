The code `val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]` updates the value of `val`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 3, so `types[i]` is `types[3]`.
- `n + m` must be greater than 0, which is a precondition and remains unchanged.
- `res` is recalculated for `i = 3`, but since `res` is not involved in this line of code, its value remains unchanged.
- `val` is updated to its current value plus `a[types[i]][n + m]`, which translates to `val` being updated to `val + a[types[3]][n + m]`.

Given that `val` is initially `ans - a[types[3]][3]`, the new value of `val` becomes `ans - a[types[3]][3] + a[types[3]][n + m]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `res` is recalculated for `i = 3`, `val` is `ans - a[types[3]][3] + a[types[3]][n + m]`**
