`cur` is assigned the value `[0, 0]`. This initializes `cur` as a list containing two zeros. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is extended by a list of integers obtained from user input, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, and `cur` is `[0, 0]`.
