`badType` is assigned the value `1 - curType`. Given that `curType` is initially 0, `badType` will be `1 - 0`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals the value of `bounds[0]`, and `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is 1.**
