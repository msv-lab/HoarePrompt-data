The code `cur = [0, 0]` assigns the list `[0, 0]` to the variable `cur`. The previous value of `cur` is `[n, m]`, but since the current value is explicitly set to `[0, 0]`, the only change is in the value of `cur`.

The states of other variables (`i`, `res`, `n`, `m`, `bounds`, `a`, `res`, `ans`, `bad`, `badType`, `curType`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is the new value of `int(input())`, `res` is a list of length `i+1`, `n` and `m` are updated by `map(int, input().split())`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing `i+1` lists, `res` is printed, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `i - 1`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is `-1`, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1.**
