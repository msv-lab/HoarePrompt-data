Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`.
   - `curType` is the opposite of its original value (so if `cur` was `[1, 2]`, then `curType` would be `0`, and vice versa).
   - `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to `curType` based on the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`.
   - `bad` is equal to `i` where the type switch happens.
   - `badType` is `1 - curType`.
   - `res` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n + m - 1`.

3. **Requirements for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the range `0` to `n + m - 1` must be valid, meaning `n + m` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop will run over a valid range.
   - We don't need to explicitly change the values of `cur`, `curType`, `types`, `ans`, `bad`, `badType`, or `res` since they will be used within the loop body and their initial states are sufficient to start the loop.

Therefore, the key state adjustment needed is ensuring that `n + m` is at least 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n + m` must be at least 1**
