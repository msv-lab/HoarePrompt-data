The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `ans` is `ans + a[curType][i]`
- `i` is an input integer
- `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`
- `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`
- `curType` remains 1 or is 0 if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` and `curType` is 0, otherwise, `curType` remains 1
- The `types` list has its `i`-th element set to `curType`

Let's analyze the impact:

1. `types[i]` is set to `curType`, so `cur[types[i]]` is equivalent to `cur[curType]`.
2. `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1.

Since `cur[curType]` was previously equal to `bounds[curType]`, after the increment, `cur[curType]` becomes `bounds[curType] + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged in their relationships and values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ans` is `ans + a[curType][i]`, `i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `curType` remains 1 or is 0 if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` and `curType` is 0, otherwise, `curType` remains 1, the `types` list has its `i`-th element set to `curType`.**
