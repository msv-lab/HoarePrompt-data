Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `i` is an input integer.
   - `res` is a list of length `i + 1`.
   - `n` and `m` are integers updated by `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `bounds` is `[n, m]`.
   - `a` is a list containing `i + 1` lists.
   - `res` is printed.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `bad` is -1.
   - `badType` is -1.
   - `cur` is `[0, 0]`.
   - `curType` is either 0 or 1.
   - `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to 0.

2. **For Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `n + m`.

3. **Dependencies for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n + m` should be at least 1 because the loop iterates from `0` to `n + m - 1`.
   - Since `n` and `m` are integers updated by `map(int, input().split())`, we need to ensure that the input values for `n` and `m` are such that `n + m >= 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `n + m >= 1`.
   - The other states mentioned (like `res`, `bounds`, `a`, `ans`, `bad`, `badType`, `cur`, `curType`, `types`) are already provided and do not directly affect the loop execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`**.
