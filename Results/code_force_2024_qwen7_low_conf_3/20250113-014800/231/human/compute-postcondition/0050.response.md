Output State: **`cur` is either [1, 2] or [0, 3]; `curType` is the opposite of its original value; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`; `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`; `bad` is equal to `i` where the type switch happens; `badType` is `1 - curType`.**
