`curType` is assigned the value 1. The preconditions `n + m` must be greater than 0 and the first element of `a` at index `i` is less than the corresponding element in the second list at the same index `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`curType` is 1, `n + m` must be greater than 0, the first element of `a` at index `i` is less than the corresponding element in the second list at the same index `i`.**
