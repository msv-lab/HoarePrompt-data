The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using the `map` function and `int` conversion. This affects the variables `n` and `m`. The values of `t` and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The conditions for `t` and the lists `a` and `b` remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, `m` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, each element in `a` and `b` is within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, and each element in `a` and `b` is distinct (a_i ≠ b_i).**
