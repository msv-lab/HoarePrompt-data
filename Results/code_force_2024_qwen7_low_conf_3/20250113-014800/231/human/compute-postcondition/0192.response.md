The code changes the value of `curType` from its current value to `1 - curType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is 1. Therefore, when we apply the operation `curType = 1 - curType`, the value of `curType` will become 0.

The other variables (`ans`, `cur[0]`, `bounds[0] + 2`, and `types[prev_i + 1]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][prev_i + 1]`, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0 if `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`. If the condition `a[0][i] < a[1][i]` is not met, the values remain as initially described in the precondition.**
