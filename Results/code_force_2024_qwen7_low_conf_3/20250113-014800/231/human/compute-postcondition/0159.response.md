The code `ans = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` is the new value of `int(input())`, `res` is a list of length `i+1`, `n` and `m` are updated by `map(int, input().split())`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing `i+1` lists, `res` is printed, `ans` is 0, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1.**
