Postcondition: **`res` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for each iteration of the loop minus `a[0][0]`, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be such that `n + m` is at least 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + number of iterations`, `curType` alternates between 0 and 1 based on the conditions, `types` list is filled with alternating values of 0 and 1, `bad` is -1, `badType` is undefined, `cur` is updated for each `curType` based on the loop execution.**
