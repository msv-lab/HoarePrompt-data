The line `curType = 0` changes the value of `curType` from its previous value (which was 1) to 0. All other variables remain in their previous states because they are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`curType` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `a[1][i+1]`, `cur[types[i+2]]` is increased by 1, if `cur[curType] + 1` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is set to `i + 1` and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise the original state is retained; `types[i+1]` is 1, `cur[1]` is increased by 1**
