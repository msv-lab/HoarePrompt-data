Postcondition: **`curType` is 1, `n + m` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `a[types[i+1]][i+1]`, and `cur[types[i+1]]` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and does not change the state of the program, the postcondition of the if part directly applies to the entire if-else block. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains the same as the postcondition of the if part.
