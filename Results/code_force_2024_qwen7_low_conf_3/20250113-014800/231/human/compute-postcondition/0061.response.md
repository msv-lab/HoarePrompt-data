`val` is assigned the value of `ans - a[types[i]][i]`. Here, `i` is updated to `i_next` which is `i + 1`. The value of `n + m` being at least 1 remains unchanged. The list `res` gains an additional element, but the specific value added is not provided. Therefore, the only changes are in `val`, `i`, and the state of `res`.

Output State: **`n + m` must be at least 1; `val` is `ans - a[types[i+1]][i+1]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `res` is a list with one additional element**
