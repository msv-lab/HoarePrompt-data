The variable `badType` is assigned the value `1 - curType`. Since `curType` is the opposite of its original value, let's denote the original value of `curType` as `originalCurType`. Therefore, `curType` is now `1 - originalCurType`. 

- If `originalCurType` was 0, then `curType` is now 1.
- If `originalCurType` was 1, then `curType` is now 0.

In both cases, `badType` will be the opposite of `curType`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 2]; `curType` is the opposite of its original value (either 0 or 1); `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i + 1` which is equal to 1; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i + 1]`; `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is `1 - curType`.**
