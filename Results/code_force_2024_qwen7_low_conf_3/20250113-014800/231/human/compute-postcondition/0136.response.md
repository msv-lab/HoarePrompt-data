The code `val = ans - a[types[i]][i]` updates the value of `val`. Given the initial state:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `res` is `[]` with one additional element `val`
- `n + m` must be greater than 0
- `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`
- `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`
- `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`
- `cur` is `[n, m]`
- `curType` is either 0 or 1
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`
- `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user
- `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`

The value of `val` is updated to `ans - a[types[i]][i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `res` is `[]` with one additional element `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user**
