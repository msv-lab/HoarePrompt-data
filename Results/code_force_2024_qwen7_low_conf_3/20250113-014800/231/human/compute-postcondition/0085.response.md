The code initializes the `types` list with zeros for each index from 0 to `n + m`. This means every element in `types` will now be 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `n + m` is a non-negative integer, `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with the new `ans` appended, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is now 0, `ans` is 0, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user.**
