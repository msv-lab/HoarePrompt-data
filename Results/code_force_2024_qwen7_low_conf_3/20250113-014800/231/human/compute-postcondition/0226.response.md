The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(2 \leq n + m + 1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers containing \(n + m + 1\) programming skills, where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq b_i\) for all \(i\).
- `b` is a list of integers containing \(n + m + 1\) testing skills, where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq b_i\) for all \(i\).

The function processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it takes `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` as inputs. Based on the provided lists `a` and `b`, the function may perform some operations (which are not detailed here), and then returns the results.

Given the output descriptions provided do not specify explicit return values but rather describe possible operations, we will assume the function returns a result based on the processing of the input lists for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, and for each test case within `t`, it accepts integers `n` and `m`, and two lists `a` and `b`. It processes these inputs and returns the results based on the specified conditions.**
