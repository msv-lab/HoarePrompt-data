The variable `bad` is assigned the value `-1`. This means that no type switch occurred. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `n + m` is a non-negative integer, `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with the new `ans` appended, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is `1 - curType`, `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user.**
