`curType` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `cur` is determined by `types[i + 1]`, but since `curType` is now set to `0`, `cur` will be `[0, 1]` because the initial state says `cur` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on the value of `types[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 1], `curType` is 0, `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0, with the `i + 1`-th element set to `0`**
