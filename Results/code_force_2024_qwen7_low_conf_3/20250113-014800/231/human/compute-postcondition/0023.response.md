The code `types[i] = curType` assigns the value of `curType` to the `i`-th element of the list `types`. Given that `curType` is `1` when `bad` does not equal `i` and `0` when `bad` equals `i`, the assignment will set `types[i]` to either `1` or `0` depending on the current value of `bad`.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`
- The length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`
- Each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\)
- `a` is extended by a list of integers obtained from user input
- `bad` is either `-1` or `i`
- `badType` is `0` when `bad` equals `i`
- `cur` is `[0, 0]`
- `ans` is `0`
- `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to `0`, with the `i`-th element now set to `curType`
- `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < n + m\)
- `curType` is `1` when `bad` does not equal `i` and `0` when `bad` equals `i`

Output State: **`t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `bounds` is `[n, m]`; the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`; each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\); `a` is extended by a list of integers obtained from user input; `bad` is either `-1` or `i`; `badType` is `0` when `bad` equals `i`; `cur` is `[0, 0]`; `ans` is `0`; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to `0`, with the `i`-th element set to `curType`; `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < n + m\); `curType` is `1` when `bad` does not equal `i` and `0` when `bad` equals `i`.**
