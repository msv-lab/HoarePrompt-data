The code appends a new list, obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, to the existing list `a`. This means the length of `a` increases by one. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code except for the addition of the new list to `a`.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `a` is updated to include a new list formed from the input, which increases its length by one.
- The other variables (`i`, `res`, `n`, `m`, `bounds`, `a`, `res`, `ans`, `bad`, `badType`, `cur`, `curType`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is the new value of `int(input())`, `res` is a list of length `i+1`, `n` and `m` are updated by `map(int, input().split())`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing `i+1` lists, `res` is printed, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `i - 1`, `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1.**
