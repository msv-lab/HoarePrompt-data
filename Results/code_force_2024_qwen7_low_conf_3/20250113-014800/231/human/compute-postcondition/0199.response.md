The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given the initial state, we know that `types[i]` is 0, so the code effectively becomes `cur[0] += 1`. Since `cur[0]` was initially `bounds[0] + 2`, incrementing it by 1 results in `cur[0]` becoming `bounds[0] + 3`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + a[0][i]`, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 3`, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0 (if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` is true, otherwise retains its initial value), `types[i]` is 0, `bad` is `i`, `badType` is 1**
