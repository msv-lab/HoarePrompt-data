`curType` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `curType` was already `0`, so assigning it `0` again does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][prev_i + 1]`, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0**
