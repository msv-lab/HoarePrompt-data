Postcondition: ***`n + m` must be at least 1; `val` is adjusted based on the following conditions: if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`; otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.***
