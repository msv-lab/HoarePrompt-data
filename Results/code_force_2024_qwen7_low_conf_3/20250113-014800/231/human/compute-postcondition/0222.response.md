Output State: **`res` is a list containing the final value of `val` for each iteration, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is the final value of `i`, `n` and `m` are such that `n + m` is at least the number of iterations, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + number of iterations`, `curType` alternates between 0 and 1 based on the conditions, `types` list is filled with alternating values of 0 and 1, `bad` is -1 if the condition `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` never fails, or the index where it fails first, `badType` is undefined if `bad` is -1, or the opposite of `curType` when the failure occurs, `cur` is updated for each `curType` based on the loop execution, `val` is updated to either `a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` if `i < bad` and `types[i]` equals `badType`, or `val + a[types[i]][n + m]` otherwise.**
