The code snippet `types[i] = curType` assigns the value of `curType` to the `i`-th element in the `types` list. Based on the initial state, `curType` is either 0 or 1. Since the value of `curType` does not change within the snippet, the only change is the assignment to the `i`-th position in the `types` list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, and `curType` remains 1. The current value of `cur[curType]` equals the value of `bounds[curType]`, and `badType` is 1 if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` and `curType` is 0. Otherwise, `curType` remains 1. The `types` list now has its `i`-th element set to `curType`.**
