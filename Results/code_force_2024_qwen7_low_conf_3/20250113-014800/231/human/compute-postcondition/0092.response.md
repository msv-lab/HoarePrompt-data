`curType` is flipped from its current value (either 0 or 1) to the opposite value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`curType` is either 1 or 0, depending on the flip of its original value; `n + m` is greater than 0; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`**
