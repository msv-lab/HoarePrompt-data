The code `types[i] = curType` assigns the value of `curType` (which is 1) to `types[i]`. This updates the value of `types[i]` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`curType` is 1, `n + m` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `a[types[i+1]][i+1]`, `cur[types[i+1]]` is increased by 1, if `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is set to `i` and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise the original state is retained; `types[i]` is 1.**
