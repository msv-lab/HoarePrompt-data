The line `badType = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `badType`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `badType`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `n + m` is a non-negative integer, `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with the new `ans` appended, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user.**
