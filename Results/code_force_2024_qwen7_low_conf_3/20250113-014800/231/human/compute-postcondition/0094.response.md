`bad` is assigned the value of `i`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `bad`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `curType` is either 1 or 0; `n + m` is greater than 0; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `bad` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`curType` is either 1 or 0; `n + m` is greater than 0; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `bad` is equal to `i`**
