The code `res.append(val)` appends the current value of `val` to the list `res`. The value of `val` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n + m` must be at least 1.
- `i` is increased by 1.
- If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is set to `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`, and `res` is a list with one additional element which is `val`.
- Otherwise, `val` is set to `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`, and `res` is a list with one additional element which is `val + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

Since the value of `val` is already determined based on the conditions before appending it to `res`, the only change in the state is the addition of `val` to `res`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n + m` must be at least 1, `i` is increased by 1, `res` is a list with one additional element which is `val`.

Output State: **`n + m` must be at least 1, `i` is increased by 1, `res` is a list with one additional element which is `val`.**
