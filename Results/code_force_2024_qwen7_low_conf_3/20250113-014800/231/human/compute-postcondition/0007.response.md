The line `badType = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `badType`. The variable `bad` remains unchanged and still holds the value `-1`. The other variables and their conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is extended by a list of integers obtained from user input, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1**
