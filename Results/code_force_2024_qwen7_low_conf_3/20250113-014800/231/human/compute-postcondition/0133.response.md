Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `res` is an empty list `[]`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`. If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, `total` remains 0 and `i` is incremented to 1. Otherwise, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, and the other variables remain as described in the else part.***
