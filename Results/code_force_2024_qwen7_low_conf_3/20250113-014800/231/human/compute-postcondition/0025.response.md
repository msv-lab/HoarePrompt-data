The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `cur` is initially `[0, 0]`.
- `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to `0`, with the `i`-th element set to `curType`.

The value of `curType` depends on whether `bad` equals `i`. If `bad` does not equal `i`, `curType` is `1`, otherwise, `curType` is `0`.

Since `types[i]` is either `0` or `1` (based on `curType`), `cur[types[i]]` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, after the line of code is executed, `cur[types[i]]` will be updated to `1` if `types[i]` was `0` before the increment, or it will remain `1` if `types[i]` was already `1`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`cur` is [1, 0] or [0, 1] depending on the value of types[i]; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to `0`, with the `i`-th element set to `curType`**
