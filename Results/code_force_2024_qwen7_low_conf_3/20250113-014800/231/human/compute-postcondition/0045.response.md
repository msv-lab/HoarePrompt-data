Postcondition: **`cur` is [0, 2]; `curType` is the opposite of its original value (either 0 or 1); `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i + 1` which is equal to 1; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i + 1]`; `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is `1 - curType`**
