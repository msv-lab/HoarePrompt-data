`curType` is assigned the value 1, which changes its state from 0 to 1. The other variables (`ans`, `cur[0]`, `types[prev_i + 1]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][prev_i + 1]`, `curType` is 1, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0**
