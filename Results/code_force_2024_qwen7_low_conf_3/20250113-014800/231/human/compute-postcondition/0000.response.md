To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the `input()` function will provide valid data. Specifically, we need to ensure that:

1. The input value for `t` (number of test cases) is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. For each test case, the inputs `n` and `m` are valid as per the given constraints.
3. Lists `a` and `b` are provided with the correct number of elements (n + m + 1) and meet the specified conditions.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Number of Test Cases (`t`)**: The loop will only execute if `t` is within the specified range.
2. **Input Handling**: For each test case, the loop body will run as long as there are valid inputs for `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute properly are:

- `t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` must be within the range 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5.
- For each test case, `n + m + 1` should match the length of both lists `a` and `b`.
- Each element in `a` and `b` must be within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
- Each element in `a` and `b` must be distinct (a_i ≠ b_i).

So, the final state to adjust is:

**`t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` and `m` are within the range 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, each element in `a` and `b` is within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, and each element in `a` and `b` is distinct (a_i ≠ b_i).**
