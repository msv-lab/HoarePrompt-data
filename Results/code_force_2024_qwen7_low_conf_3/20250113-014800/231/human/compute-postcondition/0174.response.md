`ans` is assigned the value of `a[types[i]][i]`. Since `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, and `curType` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition given, `ans` is incremented by the value of `a[curType][i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `cur[curType]`, `bounds[curType]`, `curType`, and `types` are not directly affected by this line of code. However, the value of `ans` changes.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + a[curType][i]`, `i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`, `curType` remains 1 or is 0 if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` and `curType` is 0, otherwise, `curType` remains 1, the `types` list has its `i`-th element set to `curType`.**
