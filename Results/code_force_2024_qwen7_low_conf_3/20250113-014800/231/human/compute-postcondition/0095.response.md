The code assigns `1 - curType` to `badType`. Given that `curType` is either 1 or 0, `badType` will be either 0 or 1 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

- If `curType` is 1, then `badType` becomes 0.
- If `curType` is 0, then `badType` becomes 1.

Since both scenarios are possible, we express the output state in terms of the given conditions:

Output State: **`curType` is either 1 or 0; `n + m` is greater than 0; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is either 0 or 1.**
