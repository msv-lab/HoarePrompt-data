Output State: **`n + m` is a non-negative integer, `val` is calculated based on the final value of `ans`, `a[types[i]][i]`, `a[types[i]][n + m]`, `a[badType][bad]`, and `a[1 - badType][n + m]` according to the rules defined in the loop, `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is the index where the type switch happened (or -1 if no switch occurred), `badType` is `1 - curType`, `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, and `res` is a list of updated values as per the loop logic.**
