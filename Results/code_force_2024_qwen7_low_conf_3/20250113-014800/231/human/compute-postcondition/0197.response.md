The code `types[i] = curType` assigns the value of `curType` (which is 0) to `types[i]`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `cur[0]`, `bounds[0] + 2`, `prev_i`, `cur[curType]`, `bounds[curType]`, `types[prev_i + 1]`, `bad`, or `badType`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][prev_i + 1]`
- `curType` is 0
- `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`
- If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` is true, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0, otherwise `types[prev_i + 1]` retains its initial value
- `types[i]` is now 0
- `bad` is set to `i` and `badType` is set to 1

Output State: **`ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][prev_i + 1]`, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`, if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` is true, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0, otherwise `types[prev_i + 1]` retains its initial value, `types[i]` is 0, `bad` is set to `i` and `badType` is set to 1**
