The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `a[types[i]][i]` to it. Let's break down the impact:

1. `ans` was previously updated by `ans += a[0][prev_i + 1]`.
2. `curType` is 0.
3. `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`.
4. If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` is true, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0, otherwise `types[prev_i + 1]` retains its initial value.
5. `types[i]` is 0.
6. `bad` is set to `i`.
7. `badType` is set to 1.

Now, let's execute the new line of code `ans += a[types[i]][i]`:

- Since `types[i]` is 0, `a[types[i]][i]` becomes `a[0][i]`.
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `a[0][i]` to it.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + a[0][i]`, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 2`, `types[prev_i + 1]` is 0 (if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` is true, otherwise retains its initial value), `types[i]` is 0, `bad` is `i`, `badType` is 1**
