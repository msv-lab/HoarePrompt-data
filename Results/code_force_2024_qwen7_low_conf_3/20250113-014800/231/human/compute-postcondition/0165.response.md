Postcondition: ***`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, and `curType` is 1. If the initial value of `a[0][i]` is less than the initial value of `a[1][i]`, then `curType` remains 1. There is no else part provided, so the condition of `curType` being 1 does not change regardless of the comparison outcome.***
