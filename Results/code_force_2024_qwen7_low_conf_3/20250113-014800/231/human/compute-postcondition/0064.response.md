Postcondition: **`n + m` must be at least 1; `val` is adjusted based on whether `bad` is within the specified range and matches `badType`. Specifically, if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is set to `ans - a[types[i+1]][i+1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`. Otherwise, `val` is set to `ans - a[types[i+1]][i+1] + a[types[i]][n + m]`. `i` is incremented by 1; `res` is a list with one additional element.**
