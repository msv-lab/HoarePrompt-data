The code `a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))` appends a new list of integers, converted from input, to the existing list `a`. This means the user will need to input a series of space-separated integers, which will then be added to the end of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `n + m` is a non-negative integer
- `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with the new `ans` appended
- `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`
- `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`
- `bad` is the index where the type switch happened (or -1 if no switch occurred)
- `badType` is `1 - curType`
- `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`
- `curType` is the opposite of its original value
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`
- `a` is a list containing one list of integers inputted by the user, and the length of `a` is 1

After executing the code, the new list of integers entered by the user will be appended to `a`. Therefore, the updated state of `a` will have the original list followed by the newly entered list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `n + m` is a non-negative integer, `res` is a list containing `n + m` elements with the new `ans` appended, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element is set to `curType` corresponding to the maximum count between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is the index where the type switch happened (or -1 if no switch occurred), `badType` is `1 - curType`, `cur` is either `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user.**
