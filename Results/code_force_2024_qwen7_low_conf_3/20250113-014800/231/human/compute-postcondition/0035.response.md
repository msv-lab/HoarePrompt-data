The code snippet sets the value of `types[i]` to `curType`. This means that the current value of `curType` (which can be either 0 or 1) is being stored in the `types` list at index `i`. No other changes are made to the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `cur` is `[0, 1]`
- `curType` is 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is 0
- `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0
- If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is `i` and `badType` is 0 if `curType` is 1, and `badType` is 1 if `curType` is 0. However, this condition is not relevant to the given code snippet since the `else` part is missing and the code simply sets `types[i] = curType`.

After executing the code:
- The value of `types[i]` is updated to `curType`.
- The values of `cur`, `curType`, and `types` before the index `i` and after the index `i+1` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`cur` is [0, 1]; `curType` is 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is 0; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i` which is now equal to `curType`.**
