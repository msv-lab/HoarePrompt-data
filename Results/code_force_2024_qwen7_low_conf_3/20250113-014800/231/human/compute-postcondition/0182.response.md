The code `badType = 1 - curType` assigns the value of `1 - curType` to the variable `badType`. Given that `curType` is 0, `badType` will be `1`.

The values of the other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `cur[curType]`, `curType`, `types[i+1]`, `a[0][i]`, `a[1][i]`, and `bad`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + a[curType][i]`, `i` is an input integer + 1, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `curType` is 0, the `types` list has its `(i+1)`-th element set to `curType`, `badType` is 1**
