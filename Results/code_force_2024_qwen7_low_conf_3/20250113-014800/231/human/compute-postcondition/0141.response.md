Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `res` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]` and the second element is `val`
   - `n + m` must be greater than 0
   - `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`
   - `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`
   - `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`
   - `cur` is `[n, m]`
   - `curType` is either 0 or 1
   - `bounds` is `[n, m]`
   - `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user
   - `val` is updated based on specific conditions

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop runs for `i` in `range(n + m)`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n + m` must be greater than 0 (this condition is already met as `i` is up to `n + m - 1`)

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
   - We need to ensure that `n + m` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `i` changes to 3.
   - `n + m` must remain greater than 0.
   - `res` will be recalculated for `i = 3`.
   - `val` will be updated based on the conditions given.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `n + m` must be greater than 0
   - `res` is recalculated for `i = 3`
   - `val` is updated based on the conditions for `i = 3`

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `res` is recalculated for `i = 3`, `val` is updated based on the conditions for `i = 3`**
