`curType` is assigned the value 1, which means it is no longer 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `a[0][i]` are not affected by this line of code. The condition that `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `curType` is 1, and the current value of `a[0][i]` is less than the current value of `a[1][i]`**
