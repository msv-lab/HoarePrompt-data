Let's break down the given code step by step:

1. `badType = 1 - curType`

- The value of `curType` is either 0 or 1. Since `badType` is calculated as `1 - curType`, if `curType` is 0, `badType` becomes 1, and if `curType` is 1, `badType` becomes 0.

- Given the initial state: `curType` is 0 or 1, `n + m` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `a[1][i+1]`, `cur[types[i+2]]` is increased by 1, if `cur[curType] + 1` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is set to `i + 1` and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise the original state is retained; `types[i+1]` is 1, `cur[1]` is increased by 1; `bad` is equal to `i`.

Since the value of `curType` is flipped to `1 - curType`, the new state for `curType` will be the opposite of its original value.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`curType` is 1 if originally 0, otherwise 0; `n + m` is greater than 0; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i+1]`; `cur[types[i+2]]` is increased by 1; if `cur[curType] + 1` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is set to `i + 1` and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise the original state is retained; `types[i+1]` is 1; `cur[1]` is increased by 1; `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is `1 - curType`.**
