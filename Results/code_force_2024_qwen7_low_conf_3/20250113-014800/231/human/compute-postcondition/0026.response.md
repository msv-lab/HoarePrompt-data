Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `cur` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on the value of `types[i]`.
   - `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, all initially set to `0`, with the `i`-th element set to `curType`.

2. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n + m - 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n + m` must hold true.
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + m`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Update the Variables**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for `cur` will depend on the new value of `i`. Specifically, `cur` will be determined by `types[i]` in the next iteration.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `cur` will be set to `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` based on the value of `types[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `cur` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on the value of `types[i + 1]`.
- `types` remains the same, as it is only modified inside the loop based on the value of `cur`.

The final state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`cur` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on the value of `types[i + 1]`, and `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to `0`, with the `i + 1`-th element set to `curType`.**

To present this in the required format:
State: **`cur` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] depending on the value of `types[i + 1]`, and `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0, with the `i + 1`-th element set to `curType`**.
