The code `badType = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `badType`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is the new value of `int(input())`, `res` is a list of length `i+1`, `n` and `m` are updated by `map(int, input().split())`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing `i+1` lists, `res` is printed, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `i - 1`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is `-1`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1.**
