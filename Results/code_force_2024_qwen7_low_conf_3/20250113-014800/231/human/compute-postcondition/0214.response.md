Postcondition: **`res` is `[val]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `cur[0]` is `bounds[0] + 1`, `types` is `[0, 1]`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is undefined, `val` is either `-a[1][1] + a[0][-1] - a[1][-1] + a[1][n + m]` or `-a[1][1] + a[1][n + m]`, `curType` is 1, `cur` is updated based on the loop execution.**
