The code updates the value of `cur[types[i]]` by adding 1 to it. Given the initial state, `cur` is `[0, 1]`, `curType` is `1`, `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to `0` except for the element at index `i` which is `1`, and `ans` is increased by `a[1][i]`.

Since `types[i]` is `1` (as it is the only non-zero element in the `types` list), the code effectively does:

```python
cur[1] += 1
```

Initially, `cur[1]` is `1`. After adding `1` to it, `cur[1]` becomes `2`.

Output State: **`cur` is `[0, 2]`; `curType` is 1; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i` which is equal to 1; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i]`.**
