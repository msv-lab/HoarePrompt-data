`ans` is incremented by the value at `a[types[i]][i]`. Given that `types` is a list where all elements are initially 0 except for the element at index `i` which is `curType`, the value added to `ans` is `a[curType][i]`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `cur` is `[0, 1]`
- `curType` is 1 (since it was initially 0 and then set to `curType`)
- `types` is a list where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `i` which is 1

Thus, `ans += a[1][i]`.

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 1]; `curType` is 1; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i` which is equal to 1; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i]`.**
