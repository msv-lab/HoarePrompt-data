The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` but does not affect the values of `i`, `res`, `ans`, `bad`, `badType`, `cur`, `curType`, `bounds`, and `a`.

- `i` remains the new value of `int(input())`.
- `res` is a list of length `i`.
- `n + m` is a non-negative integer, and this is unchanged.
- `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `i - 1`, and this is unchanged.
- `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, and this is unchanged.
- `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, and this is unchanged.
- `cur` is `[n, m]`, and now `n` and `m` have been updated.
- `curType` is either 0 or 1, and this is unchanged.
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`, and now `n` and `m` have been updated.
- `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user, and this is unchanged.
- `res` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is the new value of `int(input())`, `res` is a list of length `i`, `n` and `m` are updated by `map(int, input().split())`, `n + m` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `i - 1`, `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user, `res` is printed.**
