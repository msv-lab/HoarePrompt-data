Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `res` is `[]` with one additional element `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`, `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`, `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `curType` is either 0 or 1, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user, `val` is `val + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`**.

In this output state, the variable `val` is updated to include the expression `a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`. All other variables remain in their initial states as described in the initial state, except for `val` which now includes the additional calculation.
