The variable `bad` is assigned the value of `i`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, and there is no prior assignment or calculation for `i` provided. Therefore, the only information we can definitively state is that `bad` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 1]; `curType` is 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is 0; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0; `bad` is `i`**
