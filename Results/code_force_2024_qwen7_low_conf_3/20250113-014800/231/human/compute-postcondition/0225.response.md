Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the calculated values of `val` for each iteration and the final `ans` value; `n + m` is a non-negative integer; `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`; `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`; `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`; `cur` is `[n, m]` after the loop completes; `curType` alternates between 0 and 1 based on the conditions; `types` list is filled with alternating values of 0 and 1 up to `n + m - 1`; `i` is `n + m`; `bounds` is `[n, m]` after the loop completes; `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user; `t` is the number of test cases, which is initially 1 but may be any integer within the given range for each test case.**
