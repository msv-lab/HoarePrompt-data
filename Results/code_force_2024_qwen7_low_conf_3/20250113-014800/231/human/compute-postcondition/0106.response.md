`bad` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables (`curType`, `n + m`, `ans`, and `cur[types[i+1]]`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`curType` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `a[types[i+1]][i+1]`, `cur[types[i+1]]` is increased by 1, `bad` is `i`.**
