`ans` is updated by adding the value of `a[types[i]][i]` to itself. Given that `types[i]` is 0, the expression becomes `ans += a[0][i]`. The value of `curType` is 0 and `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, and `types[i]` is 0. The only change in the output state is the addition to `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by `ans += a[0][i]`, `curType` is 0; `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`; `types[i]` is 0**
