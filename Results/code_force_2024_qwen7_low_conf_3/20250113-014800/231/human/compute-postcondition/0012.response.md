`curType` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `curType` was previously undefined (or `None` if it's a non-integer type), but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), bounds is `[n, m]`, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is extended by a list of integers obtained from user input, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0, `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0, `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < n + m\), `curType` is 0**
