Postcondition: ***`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, and `curType` remains 1. The current value of `cur[curType]` equals the value of `bounds[curType]`, and `badType` is 1 if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` and `curType` is 0. Otherwise, `curType` remains 1.***
