The code snippet sets `types[i]` to `curType`. This means `types[i]` is now equal to the current value of `curType`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the value of `a[curType][i]` and `curType` is 0; `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`; `types[i]` is 0**
