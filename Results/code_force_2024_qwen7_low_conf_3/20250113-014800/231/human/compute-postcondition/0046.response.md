Postcondition: ***`cur` is [0, 2]; `curType` is the opposite of its original value (either 0 or 1); `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0 except for the element at index `i + 1` which is equal to 1; `ans` is increased by `a[1][i + 1]`; `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is `1 - curType`. If the condition `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` is true, `curType` changes to the opposite value. Regardless of the condition, the other variables remain as described in the if part since there is no else part to alter them further.***
