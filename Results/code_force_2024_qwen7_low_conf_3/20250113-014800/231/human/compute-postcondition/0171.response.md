Postcondition: ***`i` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, and `curType` is 0. The current value of `cur[curType]` equals the value of `bounds[0]`, and `badType` is 1. This holds true whether `bad` is equal to `i` or not since there is no else part that changes this state when `bad != i`.***
