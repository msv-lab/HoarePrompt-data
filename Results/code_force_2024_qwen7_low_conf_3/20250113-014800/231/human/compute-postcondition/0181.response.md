The variable `bad` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is an input integer + 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. 

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + a[curType][i]`, `i` is an input integer + 1, `n` and `m` are integers such that `n + m >= 1`, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `curType` is 0, the `types` list has its `(i+1)`-th element set to `curType`. If `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`, the condition is met and `bad` is assigned `i`; otherwise, the conditions remain as initially specified.**
