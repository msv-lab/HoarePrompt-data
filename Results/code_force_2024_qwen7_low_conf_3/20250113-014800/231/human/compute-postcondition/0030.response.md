`curType` is updated to `1 - curType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is either 0 or 1. If `curType` was 0, it will become 1, and if `curType` was 1, it will become 0. The values of `cur` and `types` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is [0, 1]; `curType` is 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is 0; `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each initialized to 0**
