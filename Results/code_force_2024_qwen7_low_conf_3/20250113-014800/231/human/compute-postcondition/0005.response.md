The code `a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and appends this list of integers to the list `a`. The initial state includes that `t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, and each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- `a` is extended by the list of integers obtained from the input.

Since the exact input from the user is not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of the appended list. However, we know it is a list of integers split from the user's input and converted to integers.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, the length of lists `a` and `b` is `n + m + 1`, each element in `a` and `b` is distinct and within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, and `a` is extended by a list of integers obtained from user input.**
