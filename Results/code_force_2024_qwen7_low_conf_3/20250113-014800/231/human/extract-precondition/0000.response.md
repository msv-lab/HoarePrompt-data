Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 2 ≤ n + m + 1 ≤ 2⋅10^5. a and b are lists of integers where a contains n + m + 1 programming skills and b contains n + m + 1 testing skills, with the condition that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ b_i for all i.**
