You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is opening his own IT company. He wants to hire n programmers and m
testers.

There are n+m+1 candidates, numbered from 1 to n+m+1 in chronological order of
their arriving time. The i -th candidate has programming skill a_i and testing
skill b_i (a person's programming skill is different from their testing
skill). The skill of the team is the sum of the programming skills of all
candidates hired as programmers, and the sum of the testing skills of all
candidates hired as testers.

When a candidate arrives to interview, Monocarp tries to assign them to the
most suitable position for them (if their programming skill is higher, then he
hires them as a programmer, otherwise as a tester). If all slots for that
position are filled, Monocarp assigns them to the other position.

Your task is, for each candidate, calculate the skill of the team if everyone
except them comes to interview. Note that it means that exactly n+m candidates
will arrive, so all n+m positions in the company will be filled.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and m (0 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; 2 \le n + m + 1 \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of programmers and the number of testers Monocarp wants to hire, respectively; 
  * the second line contains n + m + 1 integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n+m+1} (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the programming skill of the i -th candidate; 
  * the third line contains n + m + 1 integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{n+m+1} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ; b_i \ne a_i ), where b_i is the testing skill of the i -th candidate. 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of (n + m + 1) over all test cases
doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n + m + 1 integers, where the i -th integer should
be equal to the skill of the team if everyone except the i -th candidate comes
to interview.

Note

Let's consider the third test case of the example:

  * if the 1 -st candidate does not arrive, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester. The total skill of the team will be 2 + 5 + 1 = 8 ; 
  * if the 2 -nd candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 ; 
  * if the 3 -rd candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a programmer. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 ; 
  * if the 4 -th candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 2 + 5 = 12 .

        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). It then calculates and prints a list of values based on specific conditions related to the elements in \( a \) and \( b \). The function determines the alternating types (0 or 1) based on the relative values in \( a \) and \( b \) and accumulates a score \( ans \) accordingly. If certain conditions are met, it adjusts the score to account for a 'bad' skill that might affect the final result. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a list of adjusted scores for each test case followed by the final accumulated score. Potential edge cases include when \( n \) and \( m \) are 0, or when the input lists \( a \) and \( b \) contain identical elements, which the function does not handle explicitly. Additionally, the function assumes that the input constraints are always satisfied, and it does not validate the input values beyond checking their ranges.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the candidate who is skipped (due to all positions being filled) has different programming and testing skills. Specifically, the program fails to update the `ans` value properly when a candidate is skipped.

Consider the following test case:
- `n = 1`, `m = 0`
- Candidates' programming skills: `a = [1, 2]`
- Candidates' testing skills: `b = [2, 1]`

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
```

This is because the program does not account for the fact that the last candidate (with skills `[2, 1]`) is skipped, and it should still contribute to the total skill of the team if the other candidates are hired according to the rules.

The issue lies in how the program updates `ans` and handles the candidate who is skipped. The program should ensure that the skipped candidate’s contribution to the total skill is correctly adjusted.
