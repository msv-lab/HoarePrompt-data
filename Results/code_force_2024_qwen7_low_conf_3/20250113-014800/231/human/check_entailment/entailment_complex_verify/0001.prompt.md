You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is opening his own IT company. He wants to hire n programmers and m
testers.

There are n+m+1 candidates, numbered from 1 to n+m+1 in chronological order of
their arriving time. The i -th candidate has programming skill a_i and testing
skill b_i (a person's programming skill is different from their testing
skill). The skill of the team is the sum of the programming skills of all
candidates hired as programmers, and the sum of the testing skills of all
candidates hired as testers.

When a candidate arrives to interview, Monocarp tries to assign them to the
most suitable position for them (if their programming skill is higher, then he
hires them as a programmer, otherwise as a tester). If all slots for that
position are filled, Monocarp assigns them to the other position.

Your task is, for each candidate, calculate the skill of the team if everyone
except them comes to interview. Note that it means that exactly n+m candidates
will arrive, so all n+m positions in the company will be filled.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and m (0 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; 2 \le n + m + 1 \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of programmers and the number of testers Monocarp wants to hire, respectively; 
  * the second line contains n + m + 1 integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n+m+1} (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the programming skill of the i -th candidate; 
  * the third line contains n + m + 1 integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{n+m+1} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ; b_i \ne a_i ), where b_i is the testing skill of the i -th candidate. 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of (n + m + 1) over all test cases
doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n + m + 1 integers, where the i -th integer should
be equal to the skill of the team if everyone except the i -th candidate comes
to interview.

Note

Let's consider the third test case of the example:

  * if the 1 -st candidate does not arrive, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester. The total skill of the team will be 2 + 5 + 1 = 8 ; 
  * if the 2 -nd candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 ; 
  * if the 3 -rd candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a programmer. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 ; 
  * if the 4 -th candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 2 + 5 = 12 .

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the calculated values of `val` for each iteration and the final `ans` value; `n + m` is a non-negative integer; `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`; `bad` is either -1 or the index of the last element that caused `cur[curType]` to reach `bounds[curType]`; `badType` is either -1 or the type (0 or 1) that caused `bad`; `cur` is `[n, m]` after the loop completes; `curType` alternates between 0 and 1 based on the conditions; `types` list is filled with alternating values of 0 and 1 up to `n + m - 1`; `i` is `n + m`; `bounds` is `[n, m]` after the loop completes; `a` is a list containing two lists of integers where the second list was inputted by the user; `t` is the number of test cases, which is initially 1 but may be any integer within the given range for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). It then calculates and prints a list of values based on specific conditions related to the elements in \( a \) and \( b \). The function determines the alternating types (0 or 1) based on the relative values in \( a \) and \( b \) and accumulates a score \( ans \) accordingly. If certain conditions are met, it adjusts the score to account for a 'bad' skill that might affect the final result. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a list of adjusted scores for each test case followed by the final accumulated score. Potential edge cases include when \( n \) and \( m \) are 0, or when the input lists \( a \) and \( b \) contain identical elements, which the function does not handle explicitly. Additionally, the function assumes that the input constraints are always satisfied, and it does not validate the input values beyond checking their ranges.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step in the context of the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it correctly parses `n` and `m`, and the programming and testing skills of each candidate.

2. **Assigning Candidates**:
   - The program initializes an array `cur` to keep track of how many programmers and testers have been assigned so far.
   - It iterates through the candidates, deciding whether to assign each one as a programmer or tester based on their skills. This logic is generally correct, although it could be simplified for clarity.

3. **Tracking Assignment Types**:
   - The program maintains an array `types` that keeps track of whether each candidate was assigned as a programmer (`0`) or a tester (`1`). This helps in calculating the team skill for each candidate exclusion scenario.

4. **Calculating Team Skill**:
   - After assigning all candidates, the program calculates the initial team skill `ans`.
   - For each candidate, it recalculates the team skill excluding that candidate. The logic here ensures that if the excluded candidate would have been a tester but the last tester slot was filled by someone else, the skill is adjusted accordingly.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the last candidate to fill a position (if both positions were about to be full) is considered. This is necessary to ensure the team skill is correctly calculated when this candidate is excluded.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately tracks which candidates are assigned as programmers or testers and calculates the team skill for each exclusion scenario.

Correctness: **True**
