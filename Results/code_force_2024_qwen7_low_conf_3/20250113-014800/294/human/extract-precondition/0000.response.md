Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a list containing two integers n and x, followed by a list of n integers representing the array a. The value of n for each test case satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^5, and x satisfies 0 <= x < 2^30. Additionally, each a_i in the array satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
