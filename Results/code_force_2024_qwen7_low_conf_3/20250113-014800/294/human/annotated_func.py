#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a list containing two integers n and x, followed by a list of n integers representing the array a. The value of n for each test case satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^5, and x satisfies 0 <= x < 2^30. Additionally, each a_i in the array satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, a = case
        
        prefix_xor = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]
        
        current_xor = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        valid = False
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            current_xor ^= a[i - 1]
            if current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x:
                segment_count += 1
                current_xor = 0
                valid = True
        
        if valid:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `results` is a list containing the maximum number of valid segments (or `-1` if no valid segmentation exists) for each test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the number of elements in each test case, `x` is the limit for the bitwise OR operation, `a` is the list of integers for each test case, and `prefix_xor` is a list where each element `prefix_xor[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i+1` elements of `a`.
    return results
    #`The program returns the list 'results' which contains the maximum number of valid segments (or -1 if no valid segmentation exists) for each test case in 'test_cases'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` as parameters. For each test case in `test_cases`, the function computes the maximum number of valid segments that can be obtained from the array `a` under the given constraints. A segment is considered valid if the bitwise OR of the elements within the segment and the bitwise OR of the entire array does not exceed the limit `x`. If no valid segmentation exists, the function returns `-1` for that test case. The function returns a list `results` containing the maximum number of valid segments for each test case. Edge cases include scenarios where the bitwise OR condition cannot be satisfied, leading to a `-1` result for that test case. The function also handles the scenario where the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).
