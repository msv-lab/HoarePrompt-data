### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, then splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It correctly parses the input to create a list of test cases, each consisting of `n`, `x`, and the array `a`.
   - This handling is efficient and handles multiple test cases as required.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the prefix XOR values correctly. The `prefix_xor` array stores the cumulative XOR up to each index.
   - This is done with the line `prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`.
   - This ensures that `prefix_xor[i]` represents the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.

3. **Segment Counting Logic**:
   - The code iterates through the array, maintaining a `current_xor` value.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x`.
   - If the condition holds, it increments the segment count and resets `current_xor`.
   - This logic is implemented correctly and ensures that valid segments are counted.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code sets `valid` to `False` if no valid segments are found and appends `-1` to the results list.
   - This handles the case where no valid segments can be formed.

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case independently and returns the correct result.
   - The overall structure of the program is sound, and it correctly handles the problem constraints.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the code indeed implements the solution correctly according to the problem description. There are no logical errors or missing cases that would invalidate the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the detailed analysis of the code.
