Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is correct and efficient for handling multiple test cases.
   
2. **Parsing Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly parses the input to extract `n`, `x`, and the array `a` for each test case. This part is also correct.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of segments `k` that satisfy the conditions.
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
     - The `prefix_xor` array is initialized to store the cumulative XOR up to each index. This is a good approach to handle the XOR operation efficiently.
   - **Segmentation Logic**:
     - The program iterates through the array to calculate the cumulative XOR and checks if adding a new segment is valid based on the condition `(current_xor | prefix_xor[n]) <= x`.
     - The segment count is incremented when a valid segment is found, and the current XOR is reset.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - If no valid sequence of segments is found, the function appends `-1` to the results. This handles the edge case where no valid segmentation exists.

Upon reviewing the function and its logic, it appears that the program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of valid segments based on the given constraints.

Given that the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided function summary, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
