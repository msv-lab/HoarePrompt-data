Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Parsing Test Cases**: It iterates over the split data to create a list of tuples containing `n`, `x`, and the array `a` for each test case.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of segments `k` that satisfy the conditions.
   - It initializes a `prefix_xor` array to store the cumulative XOR up to each index.
   - It then iterates through the array to calculate the cumulative XOR and checks if adding a new segment is valid based on the condition `(current_xor | prefix_xor[n]) <= x`.
   - If a valid segment is found, it increments the segment count and resets the current XOR.
   - If a valid sequence of segments is found, it appends the count to the results; otherwise, it appends `-1`.

Given the detailed implementation and the logic being directly aligned with the problem requirements, the provided program should work correctly for the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
