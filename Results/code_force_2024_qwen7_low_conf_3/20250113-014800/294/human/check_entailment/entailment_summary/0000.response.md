Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input data correctly, parsing multiple test cases with their respective arrays.
2. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case, calculating the prefix XOR values for the array.
3. It then attempts to find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of each segment and the entire array does not exceed `x`.
4. The logic for checking the validity of segments and updating the count of segments is implemented correctly.
5. The function returns the correct result for each test case, either the maximum number of valid segments or `-1` if no valid segmentation exists.
6. The program handles edge cases correctly, including when the bitwise OR condition cannot be satisfied.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be implemented correctly according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
