Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the key aspects of the solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and processes it to form individual test cases. This approach ensures that all necessary data is available for processing without redundant reading.

2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, the program calculates the prefix XOR values efficiently using a list `prefix_xor`. This list helps in quickly computing the XOR of any subarray of `a`.

3. **Finding Valid Segments**: The program iterates through the array while maintaining a `current_xor` variable. It checks if the current XOR value combined with the prefix XOR of the remaining array (`prefix_xor[n]`) does not exceed `x`. If this condition holds, a new segment is started, and the `current_xor` is reset to zero. The `valid` flag ensures that at least one valid segment was found for the test case.

4. **Result Construction**: After processing all elements, the program appends the count of valid segments (or -1 if no valid segments were found) to the `results` list.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case where no valid segments can be formed, returning -1 in such scenarios.

Given that the program follows the problem statement accurately and handles all described edge cases properly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
