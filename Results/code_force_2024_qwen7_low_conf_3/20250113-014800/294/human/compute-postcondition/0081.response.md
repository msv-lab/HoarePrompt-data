The code snippet `prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]` updates the value of `prefix_xor[i]` based on the previous value of `prefix_xor[i - 1]` and the value of `a[i - 1]`. However, without specific initial values for `prefix_xor` and `a`, we cannot determine the exact updated values. We know that the operation is an XOR operation between the previous value of `prefix_xor` and the corresponding element in `a`.

Given that there are no initial values provided, we can only describe the operation and its impact on the variables:

Output State: **`prefix_xor[i]' is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]'**.
