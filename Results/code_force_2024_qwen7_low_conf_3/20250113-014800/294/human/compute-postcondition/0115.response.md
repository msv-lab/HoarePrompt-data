Output State: **`results` is a list containing the maximum number of valid segments (or `-1` if no valid segmentation exists) for each test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the number of elements in each test case, `x` is the limit for the bitwise OR operation, `a` is the list of integers for each test case, and `prefix_xor` is a list where each element `prefix_xor[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i+1` elements of `a`.**
