The initial value of `current_xor` is (`current_xor_initial ^ a[0]`) ^ `a[1]`. The code sets `current_xor` to 0, which changes its value from the initial state. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `segment_count`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`current_xor` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `segment_count` is increased by 1**
