`results.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. The previous value of `results` was `[-1]`, and now it will be `[-1, -1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_xor` is the XOR of all elements in `a` up to `a[n]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `segment_count` is the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x` and `valid` is `False`, `results` contains `[-1, -1]`, `a` is the third element of `case`, `prefix_xor[n + 1]` is the final value of `prefix_xor` after all iterations, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0.**
