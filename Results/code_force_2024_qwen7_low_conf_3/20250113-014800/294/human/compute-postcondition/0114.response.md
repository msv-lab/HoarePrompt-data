Postcondition: ***`segment_count` is the number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` (which becomes 0 after each valid segment) and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is `n + 1`, `current_xor` is 0, `valid` is either `True` or `False`, `results` is either the original contents plus the value of `segment_count` or the original contents followed by `-1`, and `prefix_xor` is a list where each element `prefix_xor[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i+1` elements of `a`, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0.***
