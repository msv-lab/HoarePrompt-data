Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is `current_xor_initial ^ a[0]`, `i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is less than or equal to `n`. If the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `segment_count` is increased by 1 and `valid` is `True`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
