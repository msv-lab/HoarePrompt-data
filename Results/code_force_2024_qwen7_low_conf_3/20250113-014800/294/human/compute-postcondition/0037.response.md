`results.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. The other variables (`current_xor`, `i`, `segment_count`, and `valid`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`current_xor` is 0, `i` is `n` + 1, `segment_count` is the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, `valid` is `False`, `results` contains `-1`**
