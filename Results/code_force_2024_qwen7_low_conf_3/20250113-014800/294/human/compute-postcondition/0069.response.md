Output State: **`current_xor` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `segment_count` is increased by 1, `valid` is True, `results` will be updated if `segment_count` changes, `a` is the third element of `case`, `prefix_xor[n + 1]` is the final value of `prefix_xor` after all iterations, all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0**
