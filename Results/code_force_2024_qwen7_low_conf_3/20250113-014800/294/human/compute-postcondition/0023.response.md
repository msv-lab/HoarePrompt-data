The variable `segment_count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state. The values of `current_xor`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`current_xor` is (`current_xor_initial ^ a[0]`) ^ `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `segment_count` is increased by 1**
