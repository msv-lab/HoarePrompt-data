`results` is a list, and the code appends `-1` to it. The value of `current_xor` is updated to `0` after each valid segment, and other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated `results` list with `-1` appended.

Output State: **`segment_count` is the number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` (which becomes 0 after each valid segment) and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is `n + 1`, `current_xor` is 0, `valid` is `False`, `results` is `[<original results>, -1],` `prefix_xor` is a list where each element `prefix_xor[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i+1` elements of `a`, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0, and `n` must be a positive integer.**
