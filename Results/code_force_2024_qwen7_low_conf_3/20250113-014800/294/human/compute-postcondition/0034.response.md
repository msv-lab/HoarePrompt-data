Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is 0, `i` is `n` + 1, `segment_count` is the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, `valid` is `True` if there exists any valid segmentation, otherwise `False`. The condition inside the if statement is met, meaning `valid` is `True`***
