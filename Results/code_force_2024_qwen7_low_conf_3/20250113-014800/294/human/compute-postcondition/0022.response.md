`current_xor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between its current value and `a[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, `i - 1` equals 1, so `current_xor ^= a[1]`. The value of `current_xor_initial ^ a[0]` is the initial value of `current_xor`. After the operation, the new value of `current_xor` is `(current_xor_initial ^ a[0]) ^ a[1]`.

Output State: **`current_xor` is (`current_xor_initial ^ a[0]`) ^ `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer**
