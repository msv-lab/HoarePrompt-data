According to the code, the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`. The state at the end of the previous iteration includes the updated value of `prefix_xor[i]` as `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`. We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the current state:**
   - `prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`.
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`.

2. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

3. **Update the state:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The new state of `prefix_xor[k + 1]` will be `prefix_xor[k] ^ a[k]`.

Since the loop is iterating from `1` to `n + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1` if `i` was previously `i`. Therefore, we need to update `i` to `i + 1`.

Given the previous state where `i` was some value `k` (let's denote it as `k` for clarity):

- `i` is currently `k`.
- After the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- The state of `prefix_xor[k + 1]` will be `prefix_xor[k] ^ a[k]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `prefix_xor[k + 1]` will be `prefix_xor[k] ^ a[k]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To generalize this, let's denote the previous `i` as `k`:

State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since `i` is being incremented within the loop and we are not given a specific value for `i` in the example, we can express the final answer in a more generalized form:

State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

For a concrete example, if `i` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[5 - 1] ^ a[5 - 1]`, `i` is 6**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
