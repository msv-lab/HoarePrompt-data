According to the code, the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is at least 1
- `x` and `a` are values from the first test case in `test_cases`
- `prefix_xor` is `[0, a0, a0 ^ a1]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should now be 3. Additionally, `n` must still satisfy the condition of being at least 1.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 1, `x` and `a` are values from the first test case in `test_cases`, `prefix_xor` is [0, a0, a0 ^ a1]**
