The code initializes `current_xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, or `prefix_xor`. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` and `a` are values from the first test case in `test_cases`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with `prefix_xor[0]` being 0 and each subsequent element `prefix_xor[i]` being the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of the `a` list; `current_xor` is 0.**
