Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is (`current_xor_initial ^ a[0] ^ a[1]`) ^ `a[2]`, `i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, `segment_count` is 2, `valid` is True. If `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `current_xor` becomes 0, `segment_count` increases by 1 to 3, and `valid` remains True. Otherwise, the values of `current_xor`, `i`, `n`, `segment_count`, and `valid` remain unchanged.***
