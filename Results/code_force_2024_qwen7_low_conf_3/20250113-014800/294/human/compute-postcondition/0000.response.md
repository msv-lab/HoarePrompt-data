The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No operations are performed on any variables, and no inputs or outputs are specified in the given snippet. Therefore, the only change is the creation of an empty list `results`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions, `results` is an empty list.**
