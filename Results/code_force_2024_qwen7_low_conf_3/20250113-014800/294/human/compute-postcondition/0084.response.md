According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `prefix_xor[i]` is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then `i_prev + 1` is the current value of `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Adjust the state:**
   - To determine the new state, we need to check if the loop can continue. If `i_prev + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then the loop can continue. Otherwise, it cannot.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. If `i_prev + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then the loop can continue.

Assuming the loop just finished its previous iteration with `i_prev` being the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `i_prev + 1`, and this value should still be within the range of `1` to `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `prefix_xor[i - 1]` is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[i - 2] ^ a[i - 2]` (since `i` is now `i_prev + 1`).
- `i` is now `i_prev + 1`.

If `i_prev + 1` is still less than or equal to `n + 1`, the loop can continue. Otherwise, it cannot.

State: **`prefix_xor[i - 1]` is updated to the value of `prefix_xor[i - 2] ^ a[i - 2]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.
