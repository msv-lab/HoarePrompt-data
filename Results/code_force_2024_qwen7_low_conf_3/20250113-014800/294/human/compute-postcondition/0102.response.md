Postcondition: ***`segment_count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 3, `current_xor` is either 0 (if the condition is met) or `current_xor ^ a[1]` (if the condition is not met), `valid` is either `True` or `False`, `results` remains unchanged, `prefix_xor` includes the cumulative XOR up to index 2, and the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`.***
