Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `segment_count` is 0, `valid` is `False`, `results` either contains `segment_count` or `-1` depending on the validity of the segmentation, `a` is the third element of `case`, `prefix_xor[n + 1]` is the final value of `prefix_xor` after all iterations, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0, and the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`***
