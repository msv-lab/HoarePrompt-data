Postcondition: **`current_xor` is 0, `i` is `n` + 1, `segment_count` is the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, `valid` is a boolean indicating whether any valid segmentation exists, and `results` either contains `segment_count` or `-1` depending on the validity of the segmentation.**
