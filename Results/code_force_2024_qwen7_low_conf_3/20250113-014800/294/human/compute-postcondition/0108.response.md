Postcondition: **`segment_count` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 4, `current_xor` is 0, `valid` is `True`, `results` remains unchanged, `prefix_xor` includes the cumulative XOR up to index 2 and `prefix_xor[4]`, the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[4]` is less than or equal to `x`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and we assume it does not change the state beyond what the if part already specifies, the overall postcondition is directly derived from the if part.
