Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `segment_count` is 1, `valid` is `True`, `results` either contains `segment_count` or `-1` depending on the validity of the segmentation, `a` is the third element of `case`, `prefix_xor[n + 1]` is the final value of `prefix_xor` after all iterations, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0. If `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x`, then `segment_count` becomes 2. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
