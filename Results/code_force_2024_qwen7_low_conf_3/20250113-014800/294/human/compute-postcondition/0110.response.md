Postcondition: ***`segment_count` is the number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` (which becomes 0 after each valid segment) and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is `n + 1`, `current_xor` is 0, `valid` is `True`, `results` remains unchanged, `prefix_xor` is a list where each element `prefix_xor[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i+1` elements of `a`, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0, and since the if condition `valid` is true, the current state of the program maintains all these conditions.***
