The code initializes a list `prefix_xor` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `a` are taken from the first test case in the list `test_cases`. After executing this line of code, the value of `prefix_xor` is updated, but `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list with at least one element; `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned values from the first test case in `test_cases`; `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.**
