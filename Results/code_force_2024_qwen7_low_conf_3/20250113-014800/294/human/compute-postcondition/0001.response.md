Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element.

2. **Initial States Provided**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly affect the execution of the loop but provides context about the possible range of values.
   - `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions. For the loop to execute, this list must contain at least one element.
   - `results` is an empty list, which does not impact the loop's execution condition directly.

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `test_cases`, `test_cases` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `t` and the fact that `results` is empty do not need adjustment as they don't affect the loop's ability to run based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are related to `test_cases`.

**State:**
- `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must have at least one element.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must have at least one element**.
