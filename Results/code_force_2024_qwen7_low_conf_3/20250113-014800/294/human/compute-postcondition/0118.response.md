Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` as parameters. For each test case in `test_cases`, the function computes the maximum number of valid segments that can be obtained from the array `a` under the given constraints. A segment is considered valid if the bitwise OR of the elements within the segment and the bitwise OR of the entire array does not exceed the limit `x`. If no valid segmentation exists, the function returns `-1` for that test case. The function returns a list `results` containing the maximum number of valid segments for each test case. Edge cases include scenarios where the bitwise OR condition cannot be satisfied, leading to a `-1` result for that test case. The function also handles the scenario where the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).**
