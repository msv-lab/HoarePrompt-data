Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is `a[1] ^ a[2]`, `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `segment_count` is increased by 1 and `valid` is set to True if `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x`. Otherwise, `segment_count`, `valid`, `results`, `a`, `prefix_xor[n + 1]` remain unchanged, with all other elements in `prefix_xor` being 0.***
