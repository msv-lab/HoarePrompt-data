`results.append(segment_count)` appends the current value of `segment_count` to the list `results`. This does not change the value of `segment_count`, `i`, `n`, `valid`, `a`, `prefix_xor`, or `current_xor`. Therefore, the only change is that `results` now contains an additional element, which is `segment_count`.

Output State: **`current_xor` is the XOR of all elements in `a` up to `a[n]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `segment_count` is the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x` and `valid` is `True`, `results` contains `segment_count` and the previous elements (if any), `a` is the third element of `case`, `prefix_xor[n + 1]` is the final value of `prefix_xor` after all iterations, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0**.
