`current_xor` is initially set to (`current_xor_initial ^ a[0] ^ a[1]`) ^ `a[2]`. After executing `current_xor = 0`, the value of `current_xor` is explicitly set to 0. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`current_xor` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, `segment_count` is 3, `valid` is True**
