The code `results.append(segment_count)` appends the current value of `segment_count` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect any other variables except `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `segment_count` is the number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` (which becomes 0 after each valid segment) and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `current_xor` is 0.
- `valid` is `True`.
- `results` remains unchanged.
- `prefix_xor` is a list where each element `prefix_xor[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i+1` elements of `a`, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0.

After executing the code:
- `results` now contains the previous contents plus the value of `segment_count`.

Output State: **`segment_count` is the number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` (which becomes 0 after each valid segment) and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is `n + 1`, `current_xor` is 0, `valid` is `True`, `results` is the original contents plus the value of `segment_count`, and `prefix_xor` is a list where each element `prefix_xor[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i+1` elements of `a`, and all other elements in `prefix_xor` are 0.
