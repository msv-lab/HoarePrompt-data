The code `results.append(segment_count)` appends the current value of `segment_count` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `current_xor`, `i`, `valid`, or `segment_count` itself, but it adds `segment_count` to `results`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `current_xor` is 0
- `i` is `n` + 1
- `segment_count` is the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`
- `valid` is `True` (since the condition inside the if statement is met)

The Output State is: **`current_xor` is 0, `i` is `n` + 1, `segment_count` is the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`, `valid` is `True`, and `results` contains `segment_count`.**
