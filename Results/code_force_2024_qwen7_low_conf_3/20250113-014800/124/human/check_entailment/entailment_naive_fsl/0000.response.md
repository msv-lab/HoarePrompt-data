Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not guarantee that all numbers from 1 to n will be present in the set of GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 after performing the operations. Specifically, the solution constructs a fixed set of operations based on the value of `n`, which does not cover all possible values of `n` within the given constraints. For example, consider the case where `n = 5`. The solution generates operations that do not ensure that all numbers from 1 to 5 are covered in the GCDs of the subsequences.

For `n = 5`:
- The operations generated might not include the necessary operations to ensure that the GCDs of all subsequences include 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The specific operations provided may not cover all required cases to generate the desired GCDs.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
