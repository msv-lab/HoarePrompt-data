You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given an integer n , you construct an array a of n integers, where a_i = i for
all integers i in the range [1, n] . An operation on this array is defined as
follows:

  * Select three distinct indices i , j , and k from the array, and let x = a_i , y = a_j , and z = a_k . 
  * Update the array as follows: a_i = \operatorname{lcm}(y, z) , a_j = \operatorname{lcm}(x, z) , and a_k = \operatorname{lcm}(x, y) , where \operatorname{lcm} represents the least common multiple. 

Your task is to provide a possible sequence of operations, containing at most
\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5 operations such that after executing these
operations, if you create a set containing the greatest common divisors (GCDs)
of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 , then all numbers from 1 to n
should be present in this set.

After all the operations a_i \le 10^{18} should hold for all 1 \le i \le n .

We can show that an answer always exists.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^2 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^{4} ) — the length of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^{4} .

Output

The first line should contain an integer k (0 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{6}
\rfloor + 5 ) — where k is the number of operations.

The next k lines should contain the description of each operation i.e. 3
integers i , j and k , where 1 \leq i, j, k \leq n and all must be distinct.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    4
    
    7

Output

    1
    1 2 3
    1
    1 3 4
    3
    3 5 7
    5 6 7
    2 3 4

Note

In the third test case, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .

First operation:

i = 3 , j = 5 , k = 7

x = 3 , y = 5 , z = 7 .

a = [1, 2, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), 4, \operatorname{lcm}(x,z), 6,
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)] = [1, 2, \color{red}{35}, 4, \color{red}{21}, 6,
\color{red}{15}] .

Second operation:

i = 5 , j = 6 , k = 7

x = 21 , y = 6 , z = 15 .

a = [1, 2, 35, 4, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), \operatorname{lcm}(x,z),
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)] = [1, 2, 35, 4, \color{red}{30}, \color{red}{105},
\color{red}{42}] .

Third operation:

i = 2 , j = 3 , k = 4

x = 2 , y = 35 , z = 4 .

a = [1, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), \operatorname{lcm}(x,z),
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y), 30, 105, 42] = [1, \color{red}{140}, \color{red}{4},
\color{red}{70}, 30, 105, 42] .

Subsequences whose GCD equal to i is as follows:

\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \gcd(1, 140) = 1

\gcd(a_3, a_4) = \gcd(4, 70) = 2

\gcd(a_5, a_6, a_7) = \gcd(30, 105, 42) = 3

\gcd(a_2, a_3) = \gcd(140, 4) = 4

\gcd(a_2, a_4, a_5, a_6) = \gcd(140, 70, 30, 105) = 5

\gcd(a_5, a_7) = \gcd(30, 42) = 6

\gcd(a_2, a_4, a_6, a_7) = \gcd(140, 70, 105, 42) = 7

```

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
