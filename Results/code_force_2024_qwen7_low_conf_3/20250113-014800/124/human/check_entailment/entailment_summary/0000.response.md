Reasoning:
The provided program aims to generate a sequence of operations that transform the initial array such that the set of GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 will include all numbers from 1 to \( n \). The program processes multiple test cases and ensures that the operations adhere to the constraints given.

Let's break down the key aspects of the program and compare them against the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the value of \( n \) for each test case.
   - It processes each test case independently, which is appropriate for the given problem.

2. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs the number of operations and the specific operations in the required format.
   - This matches the problem statement's requirements.

3. **Operation Generation**:
   - The program generates a sequence of operations based on specific rules and conditions.
   - These rules are designed to ensure that all numbers from 1 to \( n \) appear as GCDs of some subsequence.
   - The rules are implemented correctly and handle different sizes of \( n \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program includes handling for specific cases where \( n \) has particular remainders when divided by 4.
   - These specific cases are handled correctly, ensuring that the generated operations meet the criteria.

5. **Predefined Results**:
   - The program uses predefined lists `ans1` and `ans2` to provide results for certain values of \( n \).
   - This approach simplifies the process for those specific \( n \) values and ensures correctness for those cases.

6. **Constraints Adherence**:
   - The program ensures that the operations do not exceed \( 10^{18} \) for any element in the array.
   - This is achieved through the way operations are defined and the constraints applied.

Given the detailed breakdown and the alignment of the program's implementation with the problem statement and constraints, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
