You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Given an integer n , you construct an array a of n integers, where a_i = i for
all integers i in the range [1, n] . An operation on this array is defined as
follows:

  * Select three distinct indices i , j , and k from the array, and let x = a_i , y = a_j , and z = a_k . 
  * Update the array as follows: a_i = \operatorname{lcm}(y, z) , a_j = \operatorname{lcm}(x, z) , and a_k = \operatorname{lcm}(x, y) , where \operatorname{lcm} represents the least common multiple. 

Your task is to provide a possible sequence of operations, containing at most
\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5 operations such that after executing these
operations, if you create a set containing the greatest common divisors (GCDs)
of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 , then all numbers from 1 to n
should be present in this set.

After all the operations a_i \le 10^{18} should hold for all 1 \le i \le n .

We can show that an answer always exists.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^2 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^{4} ) — the length of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^{4} .

Output

The first line should contain an integer k (0 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{6}
\rfloor + 5 ) — where k is the number of operations.

The next k lines should contain the description of each operation i.e. 3
integers i , j and k , where 1 \leq i, j, k \leq n and all must be distinct.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    4
    
    7

Output

    1
    1 2 3
    1
    1 3 4
    3
    3 5 7
    5 6 7
    2 3 4

Note

In the third test case, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .

First operation:

i = 3 , j = 5 , k = 7

x = 3 , y = 5 , z = 7 .

a = [1, 2, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), 4, \operatorname{lcm}(x,z), 6,
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)] = [1, 2, \color{red}{35}, 4, \color{red}{21}, 6,
\color{red}{15}] .

Second operation:

i = 5 , j = 6 , k = 7

x = 21 , y = 6 , z = 15 .

a = [1, 2, 35, 4, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), \operatorname{lcm}(x,z),
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)] = [1, 2, 35, 4, \color{red}{30}, \color{red}{105},
\color{red}{42}] .

Third operation:

i = 2 , j = 3 , k = 4

x = 2 , y = 35 , z = 4 .

a = [1, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), \operatorname{lcm}(x,z),
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y), 30, 105, 42] = [1, \color{red}{140}, \color{red}{4},
\color{red}{70}, 30, 105, 42] .

Subsequences whose GCD equal to i is as follows:

\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \gcd(1, 140) = 1

\gcd(a_3, a_4) = \gcd(4, 70) = 2

\gcd(a_5, a_6, a_7) = \gcd(30, 105, 42) = 3

\gcd(a_2, a_3) = \gcd(140, 4) = 4

\gcd(a_2, a_4, a_5, a_6) = \gcd(140, 70, 30, 105) = 5

\gcd(a_5, a_7) = \gcd(30, 42) = 6

\gcd(a_2, a_4, a_6, a_7) = \gcd(140, 70, 105, 42) = 7

# Execution Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case specifies an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it generates a set of subsequence pairs that ensure the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 covers all numbers from 1 to \( n \). The function then outputs these results in a specific format. The function does not accept any parameters and reads inputs from standard input. After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output.

Specifically, the function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases \( t \) and initializes the result list.
2. For each test case, reads the value of \( n \).
3. Checks if \( n \) is in a predefined list `ans1` and uses corresponding precomputed results from `ans2` if found.
4. If not, constructs a set of subsequence pairs based on specific rules:
   - If \( n \) is small enough, directly adds specific subsequence pairs.
   - Handles larger \( n \) values by breaking them into smaller segments and applying the construction rules.
5. Ensures the constructed subsequence pairs cover all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
6. Formats and writes the results to standard output in a specified format, including the number of subsequence pairs and the pairs themselves.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes \( n \) is always within the valid range [3, 3 * 10^4].
- It handles specific cases for \( n \) when \( n - 1 \mod 4 = 2 \), \( n - 2 \mod 4 = 2 \), and \( n - 3 \mod 4 = 2 \).
- It ensures that all subsequence pairs are valid and cover all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
- It handles cases where \( n \) might be very large but guarantees that all elements in the resulting subsequence pairs do not exceed \( 10^{18} \).

The function does not explicitly handle invalid inputs or out-of-range values for \( n \), and it relies on predefined lists `ans1` and `ans2` to provide results for certain values of \( n \).
