Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to check whether it meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Number of Operations**: The program should perform at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5\) operations.
2. **Output Format**: The output should list the number of operations followed by the indices involved in each operation.
3. **Result Verification**: After performing the operations, the set of GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 should contain all numbers from 1 to \(n\).
4. **Constraints**: All elements of the array should be less than or equal to \(10^{18}\) after the operations.

Let's analyze the code:

- **Input Reading**: The function reads the input correctly and processes it.
- **Operations Generation**: The logic for generating operations is somewhat complex but follows the constraints and requirements. It ensures that the number of operations is controlled and within the limit.
- **Output Generation**: The output format matches the required format.
- **Handling Specific Cases**: The code handles specific cases like small values of \(n\) and ensures that the operations are performed in a way that the final array will meet the requirement.

Given the constraints and the nature of the operations, the code seems to follow the problem's guidelines and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
