t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^2, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^4. Additionally, the length of the array a is n, and a_i = i for all integers i in the range [1, n]. All operations must ensure that after executing the specified number of operations, the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 cover all numbers from 1 to n, and all elements in the array a must satisfy a_i ≤ 10^{18}.
