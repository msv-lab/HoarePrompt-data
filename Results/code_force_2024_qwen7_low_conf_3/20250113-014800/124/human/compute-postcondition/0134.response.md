The value of `pos` is updated to `i + 2`. Given that `i` is initially 11, `pos` will be 13. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 11, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13]]`, `results` is `'[3 4 5][7 8 9][11 12 13]13'`, `t` is 1, `pos` is 13**
