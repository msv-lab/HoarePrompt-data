The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`. The variable `data` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. However, we know that `n` is now an integer. The other variables (`i`, `per`, `ost`, `ans`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the elements from `ost` (if any), `results` is a list with one additional element compared to the previous iteration, `n` is an integer equal to `data[index]`**
