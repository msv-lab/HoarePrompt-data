`ans` is appended with the list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`. Given the initial value of `i` is 3, the list added to `ans` is `[3, 4, 5]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, and `t` is 1; `pos` is 0.**
