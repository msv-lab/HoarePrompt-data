Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 8.
   - If `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` contains the list `[4k - 1, 4k, 4k + 1]` where `4k - 1` is the current value of `i`, and `pos` is `n // 2 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the precondition.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from `3` to `n - 1` with a step of `4`.

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(3, n - 1, 4)`, so the next value of `i` would be `n // 2 - 1 + 4 = n // 2 + 3`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - We need to check if `n // 2 + 3` is within the range `3` to `n - 1`.
   - Since `n` is at least 8, `n // 2` is at least 4, and `n // 2 + 3` will be at least 7, which is within the range `3` to `n - 1` (since `n - 1` is at least 7).

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `n // 2 + 3`.
   - The condition for `ans` and `pos` remains the same unless `i` becomes greater than `n // 2 - 2`.

Given the above steps, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `i` is now `n // 2 + 3`.
- The conditions for `ans` and `pos` remain the same unless `i` exceeds `n // 2 - 2`.

So, the new state is:
State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 3`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 8. If `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` contains the list `[4k - 1, 4k, 4k + 1]` where `4k - 1` is the current value of `i`, and `pos` is `n // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the precondition.**
