Postcondition: ***`i` is 11, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13]]`, `results` is `'[3 4 5][7 8 9][11 12 13]13'`, `t` is 1, `pos` is 13. This is because if `i > n // 2 - 2` holds true, then `i` is updated to 11, `n` is updated to 13, and `ans` is appended with `[11, 12, 13]`. The `results` list is updated to include these new values. If the condition does not hold, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part provided.***
