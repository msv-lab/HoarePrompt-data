Postcondition: ***`total` is an unspecified integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is a list of integers where `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, 8], `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 3, `results` is `['2', '2 6 8', '3 5 7']`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is 8 with `ans` being `[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]`. If `n` is in `ans1`, then `n` is set to 8 and `results` is updated to `['2', '2 6 8', '3 5 7']`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
