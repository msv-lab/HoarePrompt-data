The code appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. Given the initial state, `i` is 8, and the condition `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`) is true because `n` is either 6 or 8. Since `i` is 8, `8 // 2` is 4, and 8 is indeed greater than 4.

Initially, `ost` is either `[8]` or empty, depending on its state before this operation. After appending `i` (which is 8) to `ost`, `ost` becomes `[8, 8]`.

Output State: **`i` is 8; `n` is either 6 or 8; `per` is 8; `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]` if `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`), otherwise `ost` contains `[8]`; now `ost` is `[8, 8]`**
