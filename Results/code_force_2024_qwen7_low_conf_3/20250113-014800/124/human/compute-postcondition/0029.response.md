`pos` is assigned the value of `i + 2`. The previous value of `pos` is unknown, but now it is explicitly set to `i + 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2`, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, `pos` is `i + 2`**
