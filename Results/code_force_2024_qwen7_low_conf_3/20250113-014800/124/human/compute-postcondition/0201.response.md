The code snippet `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` impacts the `results` list and the `x` list. This line appends a string representation of the elements in `x` (joined by spaces) to the `results` list. However, since the initial values of `results` and `x` are not provided, we can only describe the general effect of the code.

The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in `x`, converting them to strings, and `join` method concatenates these string representations with a space in between. The resulting string is then appended to the `results` list.

Since the exact values of `results` and `x` are not specified, we cannot provide specific values for the output. Therefore, the output state will include the general effect of the code on `results` and `x`.

Output State: **`results` is a list with an additional element which is a string representation of the elements in `x` joined by spaces, `x` remains unchanged**
