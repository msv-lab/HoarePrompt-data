Postcondition: ***`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the elements from `ost` (if any), `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` and has one additional element compared to the previous iteration, `n` is an integer equal to `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1. If `n` is in `ans1`, the function continues with the updated `results` list; otherwise, it does not change the `results` list and continues with the updated state.***
