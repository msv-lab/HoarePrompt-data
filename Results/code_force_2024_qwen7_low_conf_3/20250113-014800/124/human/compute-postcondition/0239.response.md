`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is at least `n // 2 + 11`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is at least `n // 2 + 11`, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` contains `[i]`**
