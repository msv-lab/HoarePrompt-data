Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`
  - `k` must be at least 1
  - `ans` must contain at least one element
  - `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`
  - `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]` or `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if its length exceeds 3
  - `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop
  - `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`

- **Loop Statement:**
  ```
  for x in ans:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ans`.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is calculated as `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`.
   - `k` must be at least 1.
   - `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`.
   - `ost` contains specific values depending on its length.
   - `per` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop.
   - `results` is a list of strings from `ans`.

### Adjusting States:
- **For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least one element.**
- **No other state needs to be adjusted because the loop does not change the values of `i`, `k`, `pos`, `ost`, or `per`.**

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`, `k` must be at least 1, `ans` must contain at least one element, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]` or `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if its length exceeds 3, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.**

Since the loop body is omitted, no new state variables are introduced or changed by the loop itself. Therefore, the states remain the same for the next iteration as long as `ans` still contains at least one element.
