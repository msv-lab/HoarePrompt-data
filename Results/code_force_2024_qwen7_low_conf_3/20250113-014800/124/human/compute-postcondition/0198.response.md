Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is `n // 2`
   - `per` remains unchanged
   - `ost` contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`
   - `ans` is non-empty
   - `results` now contains one additional element which is a string representing the joined values of `x` separated by spaces.

2. **Understand the loop structure:**
   ```python
   for x in ans:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `ans`.
   - Since `ans` is non-empty, there is at least one element to iterate over initially.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - `i` remains `n // 2` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `per` remains unchanged.
   - `ost` still contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` because the value of `i` does not change within the loop.
   - `ans` is now empty after processing all elements in the first iteration.
   - `results` will now contain two additional elements since the loop body processes each element in `ans`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration:**
   - `i` is `n // 2`
   - `per` remains unchanged
   - `ost` contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`
   - `ans` is empty (since it was non-empty and all elements were processed)
   - `results` now contains two additional elements, which means it has grown by one element from the previous iteration.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `ans` is empty, `results` now contains two additional elements**.
