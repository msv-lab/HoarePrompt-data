The code snippet `ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. Based on the initial state, the value of `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), and `ost` contains one of the values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. After appending `i` to `ost`, `ost` will contain the original elements plus the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), `ost` is a list containing the original values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, plus the new value of `i`, `per` is greater than or equal to `n // 2`**
