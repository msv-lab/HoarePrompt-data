The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. However, the value of `data[index]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `n`. But we know that `n` is originally either 6 or 8. After the assignment, `n` will take the value of `data[index]`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `per`, `ost`, `ans`, `results`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` is correctly formed based on the length of `ost`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, and `t` is 1**
