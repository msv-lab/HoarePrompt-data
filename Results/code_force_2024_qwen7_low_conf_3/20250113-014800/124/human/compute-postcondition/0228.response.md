Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 8. If `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 2, n // 2 + 3, n // 2 + 4]` and `pos` is `n // 2 + 5`. Otherwise, `i` remains `n // 2 + 3` and `n` is greater than or equal to 8, with `ans` containing `[4k - 1, 4k, 4k + 1]` where `4k - 1` is the current value of `i`, and `pos` is `n // 2 + 1`.***
