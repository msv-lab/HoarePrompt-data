The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration, but it does not change the values of the variables outside the loop. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, we assume that `continue` is inside a loop, and the variables `results` and `ans` remain unchanged within that loop context.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, `ans` is not an empty list**
