Postcondition: ***`i` is 7, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, and `t` is 1; `pos` is 9. This state is reached if `i > n // 2 - 2`. Since there is no else part, this condition directly determines the final state of the program.***
