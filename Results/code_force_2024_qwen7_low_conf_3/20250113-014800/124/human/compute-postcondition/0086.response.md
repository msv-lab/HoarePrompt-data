The code appends a new list `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]` to the `ans` list. Given the initial state, `ost` contains `[9, 9]`, so `ost[1]` is `9` and `ost[0]` is `9`. Therefore, the new list appended to `ans` is `[1, 9, 9]`.

- The `ans` list initially contains `[8, 4, 0]`.
- After appending `[1, 9, 9]`, `ans` becomes `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9]]`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `per`, `ost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9]]`, `per` is 8, and `ost` contains `[9, 9]`.**
