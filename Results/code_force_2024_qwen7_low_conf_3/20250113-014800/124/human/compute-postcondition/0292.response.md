The code appends a string representation of the length of the list `ans` to the `results` list. However, since `results` is not defined in the given initial state, it implies that `results` is being initialized as an empty list before this line of code. The length of `ans` is calculated based on its definition.

Given the initial state, let's break down the definition of `ans`:

- `ans` is the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8` and `i_end + 12 > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, plus `[1, 2, 7]` if `len(ost) == 1`.

Since `results` is being appended with a string representation of the length of `ans`, and no changes are made to `ans` within the provided code snippet, the length of `ans` remains unchanged. Therefore, `results` will contain the length of `ans` as a string.

The output state is:
- The length of `ans` is appended to `results` as a string.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial definitions.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`; `ans` is the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8` and `i_end + 12 > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, plus `[1, 2, 7]` if `len(ost) == 1`; `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`; `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, or `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]` and `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if `len(ost) > 3`; `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the value of `i` at the start of the loop; `results` contains a string representation of the length of `ans`.**
