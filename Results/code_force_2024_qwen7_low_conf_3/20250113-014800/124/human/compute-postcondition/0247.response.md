The code assigns the value of `n - 1` to `per`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, and `n - 1` is congruent to 2 modulo 4, `per` will be `n - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, and `per` is now `n - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, and `per` is `n - 1`.**
