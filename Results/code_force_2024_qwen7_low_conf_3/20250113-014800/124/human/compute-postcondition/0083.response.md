The code appends the list `[1, 2, ost[0]]` to the list `ans`. Given that `ost` contains `[9]`, `ost[0]` is `9`. Therefore, the new list appended to `ans` is `[1, 2, 9]`.

The initial state of `ans` is `[8, 4, 0]`. After appending `[1, 2, 9]`, the updated state of `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [1, 2, 9]]`.

The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `per`, and `ost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0, [1, 2, 9]]`, `per` is 8, `ost` contains `[9]`**
