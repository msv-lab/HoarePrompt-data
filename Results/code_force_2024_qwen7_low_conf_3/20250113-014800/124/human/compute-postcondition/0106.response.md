According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` is correctly formed based on the length of `ost`, and `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since no specific value for `t` is mentioned in the given state, we assume that `t` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be set to 1 again.

State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` is correctly formed based on the length of `ost`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, and `t` is 1**
