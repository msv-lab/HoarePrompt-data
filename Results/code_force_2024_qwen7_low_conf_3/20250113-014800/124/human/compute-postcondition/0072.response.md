`ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]` because `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`), and `i` is 8. The code appends `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to `ans`. Since `i` is 8, `i - 4` is 4, and `i - 8` is 0. Therefore, `ans` becomes `[8, 4, 0, [8, 4, 0]]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `per`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [8, 4, 0]]`**
