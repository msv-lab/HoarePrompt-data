According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop iterates over each element in `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the string representation of the elements in `x` joined by spaces, and `x` remains unchanged.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop iterates over each element in `ans`.
2. After each iteration, `x` remains unchanged.
3. `results` gets an additional element in each iteration, which is the string representation of the elements in `x` joined by spaces.

At the end of the previous iteration, `results` has one additional element, and `x` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must contain at least one more element.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `results` will have another additional element, which is the string representation of the next `x` joined by spaces.
- `x` remains unchanged.

State: **`results` is a list containing two additional elements, which are the string representations of the elements in `x` joined by spaces; `x` remains unchanged**
