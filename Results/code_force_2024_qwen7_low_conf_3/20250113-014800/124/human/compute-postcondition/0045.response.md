`ost` is a list that appends the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 9, so `ost` will be updated to include 9. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 9, `n` is 8, `ans` contains [3, 4, 5, 11], `pos` is 8, and `ost` is [9].

Output State: **`i` is 9, `n` is 8, `ans` contains [3, 4, 5, 11], `pos` is 8, `ost` is [9]**
