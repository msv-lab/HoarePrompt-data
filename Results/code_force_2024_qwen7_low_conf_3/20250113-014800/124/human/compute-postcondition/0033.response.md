The initial state is as follows: `i` is `i + 4`, `n` is the same, `ans` contains at least `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]` if `i + 4` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, otherwise `ans` is `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, `pos` is `i + 6`.

The code snippet is:
```python
pos = i + 2
```

This line updates the value of `pos` from `i + 6` to `i + 2`. This means that the previous value of `pos` (which was `i + 6`) is now `i + 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `n` is the same, `ans` contains at least `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]` if `i + 4` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, otherwise `ans` is `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, `pos` is `i + 2`**
