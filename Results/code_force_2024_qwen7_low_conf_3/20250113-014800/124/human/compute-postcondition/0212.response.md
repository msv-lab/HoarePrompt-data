According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `ans` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` contains two elements, both of which are `' '.join(map(str, x))`, and `ans` is not an empty list.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `ans`.
2. Since `results` currently contains two elements, it means the loop has already processed the first two elements of `ans`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, `ans` must have at least one element left.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` contains two elements.
2. This means the loop has already processed the first two elements of `ans`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must have at least one element left.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` still contains two elements (as they were not cleared or modified within the loop body), and `ans` must have at least one element left.

State: **`results` contains two elements, both of which are `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` must have at least one element**
