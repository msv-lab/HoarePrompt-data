The code appends a list `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ost` contains `[9, 9]`, so `ost[0]` is `9` and `ost[1]` is `9`. Therefore, the appended list is `[1, 9, 9]`.

- `i` remains unchanged at 8.
- `n` remains either 6 or 8.
- `ans` changes from containing `[8, 4, 0]` to `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9]]`.
- `per` remains unchanged at 8.
- `ost` remains as `[9, 9, None, None]` (since the length of `ost` was mentioned to be 4, the last two elements are implicitly `None`).

Output State: **`i` is 8; `n` is either 6 or 8; `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9]]`; `per` is 8; `ost` contains `[9, 9, None, None]`**
