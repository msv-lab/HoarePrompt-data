Postcondition: **`ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` includes the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`. Otherwise, `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), and `ost` contains one of the values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. `i` is greater than or equal to `n // 2` and `per` must be greater than or equal to `n // 2`.**
