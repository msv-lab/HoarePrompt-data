The code appends a new element to the `results` list. Specifically, it joins the elements of `x` (which is assumed to be a list) into a single string with each element converted to a string and separated by spaces. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `x`, we can only represent it in a general form.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a new element to the `results` list. This new element is a string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces.
2. The values of `i`, `per`, `ost`, `ans`, and the existing elements of `results` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `ans` is non-empty, `results` now contains one additional element which is a string representing the joined values of `x` separated by spaces.**
