The code appends the list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the list `ans`. This means that regardless of the initial conditions of `i` and `n`, the list `ans` will now contain both the original elements specified in the precondition and the new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`.

Since the code does not change the values of `n` or `pos`, these remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `n` is the same, `ans` contains at least `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]` and `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged as `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, and `pos` is `i + 6` if the condition is true, otherwise `pos` remains `i + 6`**
