`ans` appends the list `[1, 2, ost[0]]` to its contents. Since `ost` contains integers from `pos + 1` to `n` that satisfy certain conditions, and currently, the length of `ost` is 1, `ost[0]` is the only element in `ost`. The exact value of `ost[0]` depends on the value of `pos` and `n`, but it will be included in the updated `ans`. 

The states of the other variables (`i`, `per`, and `ost`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, the length of `ost` is 1, `ans` now includes the additional element `[1, 2, ost[0]]`**
