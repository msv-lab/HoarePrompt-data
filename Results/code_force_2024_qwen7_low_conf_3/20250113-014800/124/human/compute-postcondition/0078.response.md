The code `ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. However, since the initial state does not specify what `ost` is (e.g., whether it is already a list), we cannot determine its exact nature before the append operation. We only know that `i` is appended to `ost`.

Output State: **`i` is appended to `ost`**
