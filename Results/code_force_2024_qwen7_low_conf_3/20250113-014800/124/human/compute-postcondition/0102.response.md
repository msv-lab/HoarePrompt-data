The code `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` has the following impact:
- `results` is a list that is appended with the string representation of the second element in `ans`, which is stored in `x`. Since `x` is the second element in `ans`, and `ans` must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 8
- `n` is either 6 or 8
- `per` is 8
- `ost` must have at least one element
- `ans` must have at least two elements
- `x` is the second element in `ans`

After the code is executed, `results` will have the string representation of `x` appended to it. The values of `i`, `n`, `per`, `ost`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ost` must have at least one element, `ans` must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `ans`, `results` contains ' '.join(map(str, x))**
