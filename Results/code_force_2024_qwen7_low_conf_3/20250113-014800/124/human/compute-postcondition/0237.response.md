Postcondition: **`i` is at least `n // 2 + 10`, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`. If `i` is at least `n // 2 + 10` and is either odd and not divisible by 4 or divisible by 4 and greater than `n // 2`, then `i` is added to `ans` and `ost` is `[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `ans`, `pos`, and `ost` remain unchanged.**
