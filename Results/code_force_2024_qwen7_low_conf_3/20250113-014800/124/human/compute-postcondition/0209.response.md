The code appends a string to the list `results`. The string is created by joining the elements of the list `x` with a space and converting each element to a string using `map(str, x)`.

- `results` is initially an empty list (from the initial state, `ans` is not an empty list, which implies `results` is not an empty list).
- `x` is a list whose elements are not specified in the initial state.

After the code runs, `results` will contain one additional element, which is the joined string of `x`.

Output State: **`results` contains the element `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` is not an empty list**
