The code `ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `i_end + 12`, and `ost` is updated to `[9, 5, 1]` if `i_end + 12 > 8`, otherwise it remains `[7]`.

First, let's determine the value of `i`:
- Since `i` is `i_end + 12`, and `i_end + 12` is definitely greater than 8 (because `i_end + 12` is exactly what we're checking against 8), `ost` will be updated to `[9, 5, 1]`.

Now, appending `i` to `ost`:
- The value of `i` is `i_end + 12`.
- The updated list `ost` will be `[9, 5, 1, i_end + 12]`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `ans` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `per` remains the same, and `pos` remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 12`, `ans` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `ost` is `[9, 5, 1, i_end + 12]`, `per` remains the same, `pos` remains the same.**
