Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 9
- `n` is 8
- `ans` contains [3, 4, 5, 11]
- `pos` is 8
- `ost` contains [9]

### Loop Condition:
The loop starts from `i = pos + 1` to `n`, i.e., from `i = 9` to `n = 8`. However, since `i` starts at 9 and `n` is only 8, the loop will not execute because there are no values in the range from 9 to 8.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 9
   - `n` is 8
   - `ans` contains [3, 4, 5, 11]
   - `pos` is 8
   - `ost` contains [9]

2. **Loop Condition Check:**
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(pos + 1, n + 1)`.
   - This translates to `for i in range(9, 9)` (since `pos + 1` is 9 and `n` is 8).
   - The range from 9 to 8 is empty, so the loop does not execute.

3. **No Change in States:**
   - Since the loop does not execute, none of the states change.

### Final States:
- `i` remains 9
- `n` remains 8
- `ans` remains [3, 4, 5, 11]
- `pos` remains 8
- `ost` remains [9]

### Conclusion:
Since the loop does not execute, the states remain unchanged.

**State: **`i` is 9, `n` is 8, `ans` contains [3, 4, 5, 11], `pos` is 8, and `ost` contains [9]**.
