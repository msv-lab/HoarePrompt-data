`results` is a list that appends a string to its contents. The string is created by joining the elements of `x` (which is not defined in the initial state) with a space and converting each element to a string using `map(str, x)`. Since `x` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact content, but we know that the resulting string is appended to `results`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` must contain at least one element, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representation of `x` joined by spaces, `t` is 1**
