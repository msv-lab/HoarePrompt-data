The code appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. Since `i` is 8, it will be appended to `ost`. The values of `n` and `per` remain unchanged, and the condition that the current value of `i` is less than or equal to 8 is still valid.

Output State: **`i` is 8; `n` is either 6 or 8; `per` is 8; `ost` contains [8]**
