Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `per` to `n // 2` with a step of `-12`. This means the loop decreases `i` by 12 each iteration.

2. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` includes the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), and `ost` contains one of the values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
   - Both `i` and `per` are greater than or equal to `n // 2`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 12 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i - 12`.

4. **Check the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i >= n // 2`.
   - We need to check if the new value of `i` still satisfies the conditions for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's assume the following at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is some value within the range specified (e.g., `i = 10` if it was greater than 8, or `i = 7` if it was between 3 and 8).
- `per` is at least `n // 2`.
- `ost` contains appropriate values based on the current `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Decrease `i` by 12**: The next value of `i` will be `i - 12`.
2. **Check the Range**: Ensure that `i - 12` is still greater than or equal to `n // 2`.
3. **Update `ost` and `ans` if Necessary**: Depending on the new value of `i`, update the contents of `ost` and `ans` accordingly.

### Example Adjustments:

#### Case 1: `i` was greater than 8
- If `i` was 10 (an example value), then `i - 12` would be -2, which does not satisfy the condition `i >= n // 2` (assuming `n // 2` is at least 6).
- Therefore, the loop would stop.

#### Case 2: `i` was between 3 and 8
- If `i` was 7 (an example value), then `i - 12` would be -5, which does not satisfy the condition `i >= n // 2` (assuming `n // 2` is at least 4).
- Therefore, the loop would stop.

Since both cases lead to `i` no longer satisfying the loop condition, the loop will terminate.

### Final State:

Since the loop condition is no longer satisfied, we don't need to adjust the states further for another iteration.

**State: **`ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` includes the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`. Otherwise, `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), and `ost` contains one of the values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. Both `i` and `per` are greater than or equal to `n // 2`.**
