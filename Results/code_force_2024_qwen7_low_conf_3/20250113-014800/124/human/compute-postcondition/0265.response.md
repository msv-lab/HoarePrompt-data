Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `n - 3` where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8.
   - `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times.
   - `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`.
   - `ost` contains `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it is `[7]`.
   - `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`.

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `per` to `n // 2` in steps of `-12`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the new values for `i`, `ans`, `pos`, `ost`, and `per` for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. **Determine New Value of `i`**:
   - The loop decrements `i` by 12 each iteration.
   - If `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_prev - 12`.

#### 2. **Check Conditions for `ans`, `pos`, `ost`, and `per`**:
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i` and the conditions depend on the value of `i`, we need to check if `i` still meets the condition for updating these lists and values.

#### 3. **Update `ans`**:
   - If `i > 8`, `ans` includes `[9, 5, 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` includes `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times.

#### 4. **Update `ost`**:
   - If `i > 8`, `ost` includes `[9, 5, 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `ost` includes `[7]`.

#### 5. **Update `per`**:
   - The value of `per` does not change within the loop; it remains as either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`.

### Conclusion:

Given that the loop decrements `i` by 12, and the other conditions remain unchanged unless `i` changes (which it doesn't here), we only need to update `i`.

- `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_prev - 12`.
- `ans`, `pos`, `ost`, and `per` remain the same.

Thus, the new state is:

State: **`i` is an integer greater than or equal to `n - 3` minus 12, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` contains `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it is `[7]`, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`.**
