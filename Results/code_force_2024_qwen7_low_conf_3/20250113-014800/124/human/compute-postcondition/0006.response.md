The variable `index` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `index` is 1, so after incrementing, the new value of `index` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the length of the array `a` is `n`, and `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, `n`], and all elements in the array `a` must satisfy `a_i \leq 10^{18}`, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2.**
