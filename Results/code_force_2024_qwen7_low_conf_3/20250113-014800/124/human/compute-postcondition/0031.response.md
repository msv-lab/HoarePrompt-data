Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `ans` contains at least `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`.
   - `pos` is `i + 2`.
   - If `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` specifically contains `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `pos` remain unchanged from the precondition.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `3` to `n - 1` with a step of `4`.

3. **Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the new values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, and `pos` for the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Key Points:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the specified range (`3` to `n - 1`).
   - The step size is `4`, meaning `i` increases by `4` each iteration.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - **`i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by `4`, we need to set `i` to `i + 4`.
   - **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - **`ans`**: We need to check the condition for `ans`. If the new `i` (which is `i + 4`) is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` should contain `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.
   - **`pos`**: Since `pos` is `i + 2`, it will become `(i + 4) + 2 = i + 6`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, the new values should be:
- `i` is `i + 4`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ans` is checked based on the new `i` to see if it needs to change.
- `pos` is `i + 6`.

Given these steps, let's write out the final state:

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `n` is the same, `ans` contains at least `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]` if `i + 4` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `pos` is `i + 6`**.
