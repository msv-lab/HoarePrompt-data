`ans` is updated by appending a new list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to it. Since `i` is `i_end + 12`, the new list will be `[i_end + 12, i_end + 8, i_end + 4]`. The values of `ost`, `per`, and `pos` remain unchanged as the code only affects `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i_end + 12`; `ans` is updated to include the list `[i_end + 12, i_end + 8, i_end + 4]`; `ost` is updated to `[9, 5, 1]` if `i_end + 12 > 8`, otherwise it remains `[7]`; `per` remains the same; `pos` remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 12`; `ans` is updated to include the list `[i_end + 12, i_end + 8, i_end + 4]`; `ost` is updated to `[9, 5, 1]` if `i_end + 12 > 8`, otherwise it remains `[7]`; `per` remains the same; `pos` remains the same.**
