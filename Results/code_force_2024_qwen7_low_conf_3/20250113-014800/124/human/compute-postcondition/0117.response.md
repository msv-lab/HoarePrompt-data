Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, `t` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables `i`, `n`, `per`, `ost`, `t`:** These variables are not modified within the loop. Therefore, they retain their initial values throughout the loop's execution.
  
- **Variable `ans`:** The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`. For each iteration, it appends the string representation of `x` joined by spaces to the `results` list. Since the loop iterates over all elements in `ans`, after the loop completes, `results` will contain the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, followed by the string representation of `n`.

- **Variable `results`:** The loop appends the string representation of each element in `ans` to `results`. After all elements in `ans` have been processed, `results` will contain the original content plus the string representation of `n`.

- **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop will execute if `ans` contains at least one element. If `ans` is empty, the loop will not execute at all, but this condition is already covered by the statement that `ans` must contain at least one element.

Thus, regardless of whether the loop executes or not (as long as `ans` is not empty), the final state of the variables is as described above.
