The code appends the list `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` to the list `ans`. Since `ost` contains `[7, 7, 7]`, the appended list is `[2, 7, 7]`.

- `i` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is updated to include the new element `[2, 7, 7]`.
- `pos` remains unchanged.
- `ost` remains unchanged.
- `per` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`, `ans` is `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8` and `i_end + 12 > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, followed by `[1, 7, 7]` and `[2, 7, 7]`; `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`; `ost` contains `[7, 7, 7]` with a length of 4; `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the value of `i` at the start of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`, `ans` is `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8` and `i_end + 12 > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, followed by `[1, 7, 7]` and `[2, 7, 7]`; `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`; `ost` contains `[7, 7, 7]` with a length of 4; `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the value of `i` at the start of the loop.**
