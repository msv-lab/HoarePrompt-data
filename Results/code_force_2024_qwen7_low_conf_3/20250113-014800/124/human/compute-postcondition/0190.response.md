The code appends `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` to the list `ans`. The list `ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, and `i` is `n // 2`. Therefore, the first element in `ost` (i.e., `ost[0]`) is the smallest integer greater than `n // 2` that satisfies the condition, and `ost[2]` and `ost[3]` are the third and fourth elements in `ost`.

Since `ost` is a list of integers from `pos + 1` to `n` that satisfy the given condition, and we know that `i` is `n // 2`, the first element in `ost` (`ost[0]`) must be the smallest integer greater than `n // 2` that satisfies the condition. Similarly, `ost[2]` and `ost[3]` are the third and fourth elements in `ost`.

After appending `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be `[1, ost[0], ost[1], 2, ost[2], ost[3]]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `ans` contains `[1, ost[0], ost[1], 2, ost[2], ost[3]]**.
