The code snippet `ans1 = [8]` simply assigns the list `[8]` to the variable `ans1`. This does not affect any other variables or the conditions related to them. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^2\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the length of the array `a` is `n`, and `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, `n`], and all elements in the array `a` must satisfy `a_i \leq 10^{18}`, `ans1` is `[8]`**
