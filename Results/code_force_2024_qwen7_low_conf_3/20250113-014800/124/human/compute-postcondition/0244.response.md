Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, and `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that satisfy the condition \((i \% 2 != 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\).**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being `pos + 1`, which is `n // 2 + 10`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Loop Iterations:**
   - For each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - The condition \((i \% 2 != 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\) checks whether `i` is either odd and not divisible by 4, or divisible by 4 and greater than `n // 2`.
   - If the condition is true, `i` is appended to the list `ost`.

3. **Final Values After Loop Completion:**
   - The loop terminates when `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` until it exceeds `n`.
   - `ans` will contain the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed.
   - `pos` remains `n // 2 + 9` because the loop does not modify it.
   - `ost` will be a list containing all values of `i` that satisfy the condition during the loop iterations.

This covers all the necessary conditions and variable states after the loop has completed its iterations.
