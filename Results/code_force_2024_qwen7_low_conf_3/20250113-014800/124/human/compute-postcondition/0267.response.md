The code `ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. The initial value of `ost` is `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it is `[7]`. Since the code appends `i` to `ost`, the updated `ost` will include `i`.

The value of `i` is such that `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `n - 3` minus 12. This means `i` could be any integer from `n - 15` upwards.

The output state includes the updated `ost` list, which now contains `i` appended to its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than or equal to `n - 15`; `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times; `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`; `ost` is `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it is `[7]`, with `i` appended to it; `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`.**
