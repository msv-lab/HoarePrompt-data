The variable `per` is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `n` is unspecified in the initial state, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `per` now holds the value of `n`.

Output State: **`ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `pos` is unspecified, `n` is unspecified, `per` is equal to `n`**
