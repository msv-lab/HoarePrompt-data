The code snippet appends a string representation of `x` to the `results` list using `' '.join(map(str, x))`. This means that the last element in the `results` list will now include the string representation of the current `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`
- `k` must be at least 1
- `ans` must contain at least two elements
- `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`
- `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]`, or `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if its length exceeds 3
- `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and `' '.join(map(str, x))`

After executing the code:
- The value of `results` is updated to include the new string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`; `k` must be at least 1; `ans` must contain at least two elements; `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`; `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]`, or `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if its length exceeds 3; `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and `' '.join(map(str, x))` followed by the string representation of `x`.**
