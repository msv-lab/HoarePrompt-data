`index` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `index` was used to access an element in `data`, but since the exact value of `data[index]` was not provided, we only know that `n` is now the value of `data[index + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` is correctly formed based on the length of `ost`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, and `t` is 1.**
