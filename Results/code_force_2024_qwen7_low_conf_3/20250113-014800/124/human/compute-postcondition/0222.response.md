The code appends a list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the `ans` list. Since `i` is `n // 2`, and `n // 2` is a multiple of 4, `i` is also a multiple of 4. Given that `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, let's denote `i` as `k * 4` where `k` is an integer.

Since `n // 2` is a multiple of 4 and `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, `i` can be `n // 2 - 1`, `n // 2`, or `n // 2 + 1`. However, since `i` is a multiple of 4, `i` must be `n // 2 - 1` (because `n // 2` itself and `n // 2 + 1` are not multiples of 4 if `n // 2` is a multiple of 4).

Therefore, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, which is still a multiple of 4 because `n // 2` is a multiple of 4. This means `i` is `4k - 1`.

- `i + 1` would be `4k`.
- `i + 2` would be `4k + 1`.

Thus, the list appended to `ans` is `[4k - 1, 4k, 4k + 1]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `n // 2` is a multiple of 4, and the current value of `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`; `ans` contains the list `[4k - 1, 4k, 4k + 1]` where `4k - 1` is the current value of `i`.**
