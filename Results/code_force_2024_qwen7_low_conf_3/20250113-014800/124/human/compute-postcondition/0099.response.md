To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ans`.

2. **List `ans`**:
   - The content of `ans` depends on the length of `ost` (which is a list).
   - Based on the description:
     - If `len(ost) == 1`, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [1, 2, 9]]`.
     - If `len(ost) == 2`, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9]]`.
     - If `len(ost) == 3`, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [9, 9, 9]]`.
     - If `len(ost) > 3`, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9], [2, None, None]]`.

3. **Variables**:
   - `i` is 8.
   - `n` is either 6 or 8.
   - `per` is 8.
   - `ost` determines the content of `ans`.
   - `results` is always `['4']`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment

1. **`ost`**:
   - Since `ans` depends on the length of `ost`, we need to ensure that `ost` has a valid length.
   - Therefore, `ost` must have at least one element (since the smallest possible `ans` has four elements, which require at least one element in `ost`).

2. **`ans`**:
   - The exact content of `ans` depends on the length of `ost`.
   - We need to ensure that `ans` is correctly formed based on the length of `ost`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - Given the structure of `ans`, `ost` must be non-empty and have a length that fits one of the described cases.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop can execute, the state should include:
- `ost` must have at least one element.
- `ans` must be correctly formed based on the length of `ost`.

Given these points, the required adjustments are:

State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ost` must have at least one element, `ans` must be correctly formed based on the length of `ost`**.

Thus, the final state is:
```
State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ost` must have at least one element, `ans` must be correctly formed based on the length of `ost`**
```
