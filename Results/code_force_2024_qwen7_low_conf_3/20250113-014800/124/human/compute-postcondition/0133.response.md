The code appends a new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the existing list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 11, the new list appended will be `[11, 12, 13]`.

Here are the updated values:
- `i` remains 11.
- `n` remains greater than 12.
- `per` remains 8.
- `ost` remains an empty list.
- `ans` now contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13]]`.
- `results` remains a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, which means it will be `'[3 4 5][7 8 9][11 12 13]13'` (assuming `n` is 13 for this example).
- `t` remains 1.
- `pos` remains 9.

Output State: **`i` is 11, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13]]`, `results` is `'[3 4 5][7 8 9][11 12 13]13'`, `t` is 1, `pos` is 9**.
