The code assigns an empty list to `ost`. This is the only variable affected by the code. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, and `t` is 1; `pos` is 0.**
