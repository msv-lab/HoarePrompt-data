The code appends a new list `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` to the list `ans`. The current values of `ost[2]` and `ost[3]` are `None`. Therefore, the new list added to `ans` is `[2, None, None]`.

- `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is 8.
- `n` remains unchanged, so `n` is either 6 or 8.
- `ans` is updated to include the new list, so `ans` is now `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9], [2, None, None]]`.
- `per` remains unchanged, so `per` is 8.
- `ost` remains unchanged, so `ost` is `[9, 9, None, None]`.

Output State: **`i` is 8; `n` is either 6 or 8; `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9], [2, None, None]]`; `per` is 8; `ost` is `[9, 9, None, None]`**
