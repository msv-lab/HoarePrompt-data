The code appends a list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the `ans` list. Since `ans` was not defined in the initial state, we can assume it is an empty list before this code runs. The value of `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2`, and it remains unchanged after the code runs. Therefore, `ans` will now contain the list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2`, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`**
