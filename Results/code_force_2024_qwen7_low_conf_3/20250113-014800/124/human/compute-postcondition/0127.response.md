Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, and `t` is 1; `pos` is 5. This is because if `i > n // 2 - 2` holds true, `ans` is updated to include `[3, 4, 5]`, and if it does not hold, no changes are made to the variables. Since the else part is not provided and thus no alternative actions are specified, the overall postcondition remains unchanged from the if part's postcondition.***
