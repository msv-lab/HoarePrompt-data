According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop will execute if `ans` contains at least one element. Here are the initial states given:

- `i` is 8
- `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`
- `per` is 8
- `ost` is unchanged
- `ans` is unchanged
- `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`
- `t` is 1

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `ans` is not empty. If `ans` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `ans` must contain at least one element.

Here is the modified state:

State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` must contain at least one element, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, `t` is 1**
