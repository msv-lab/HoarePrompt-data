`pos` is assigned the value of `i + 2`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, so `pos` becomes `(n // 2 - 1) + 2`, which simplifies to `n // 2 + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `n // 2` is a multiple of 4, and the current value of `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`; `ans` contains the list `[4k - 1, 4k, 4k + 1]` where `4k - 1` is the current value of `i`, `pos` is `n // 2 + 1`**
