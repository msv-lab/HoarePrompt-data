`pos` is assigned the value of `i + 2`. Given that `i` is 3, `pos` becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, and `t` is 1; `pos` is 5.
