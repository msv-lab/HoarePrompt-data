Postcondition: ***`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, and `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]` if `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`), otherwise `ost` contains `[8]`. Since there is no else part, if `i` is not greater than `n // 2`, `ost` remains `[8]`. Therefore, the final postcondition is that `i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, and `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]` if `i > 4`, otherwise `ost` contains `[8]`***.
