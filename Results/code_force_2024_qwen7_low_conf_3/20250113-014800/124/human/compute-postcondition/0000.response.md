The given code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to read the entire standard input at once. This does not affect any variables or their values directly. It just changes how input is handled in the program. The initial conditions regarding the variables `t`, `n`, and the array `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^2, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^4. Additionally, the length of the array `a` is `n`, and `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, `n`]. All operations must ensure that after executing the specified number of operations, the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 cover all numbers from 1 to `n`, and all elements in the array `a` must satisfy `a_i ≤ 10^{18}. Input is now read using `sys.stdin.read`.**
