The code appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the `ans` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, and `i` is greater than `n // 2`. Since `i` is 8, `n // 2` is either 3 (if `n` is 6) or 4 (if `n` is 8). In both cases, `i` (which is 8) is greater than `n // 2`.

After executing the code, the list `[8, 4, 0]` is appended to `ans`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `per` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, and `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]`.**
