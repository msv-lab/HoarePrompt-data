`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `i` is `pos + 2`, it is added to `ost`. The values of `total` and `pos` remain unspecified. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `pos + 3` remains valid.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `pos + 2`, `pos` is unspecified, `n` must be greater than or equal to `pos + 3`, `ost` contains `pos + 2`**
