The code appends `' '.join(map(str, x))` to the `results` list. Since `results` initially contains the element `' '.join(map(str, x))`, appending the same element again does not change its contents except for adding another copy of the same element.

The output state is:

Output State: **`results` contains two elements, both of which are `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` is not an empty list**
