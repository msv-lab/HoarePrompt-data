Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case specifies an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it generates a set of subsequence pairs that ensure the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 covers all numbers from 1 to \( n \). The function then outputs these results in a specific format. The function does not accept any parameters and reads inputs from standard input. After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output.

Specifically, the function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases \( t \) and initializes the result list.
2. For each test case, reads the value of \( n \).
3. Checks if \( n \) is in a predefined list `ans1` and uses corresponding precomputed results from `ans2` if found.
4. If not, constructs a set of subsequence pairs based on specific rules:
   - If \( n \) is small enough, directly adds specific subsequence pairs.
   - Handles larger \( n \) values by breaking them into smaller segments and applying the construction rules.
5. Ensures the constructed subsequence pairs cover all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
6. Formats and writes the results to standard output in a specified format, including the number of subsequence pairs and the pairs themselves.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes \( n \) is always within the valid range [3, 3 * 10^4].
- It handles specific cases for \( n \) when \( n - 1 \mod 4 = 2 \), \( n - 2 \mod 4 = 2 \), and \( n - 3 \mod 4 = 2 \).
- It ensures that all subsequence pairs are valid and cover all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
- It handles cases where \( n \) might be very large but guarantees that all elements in the resulting subsequence pairs do not exceed \( 10^{18} \).

The function does not explicitly handle invalid inputs or out-of-range values for \( n \), and it relies on predefined lists `ans1` and `ans2` to provide results for certain values of \( n \).**
