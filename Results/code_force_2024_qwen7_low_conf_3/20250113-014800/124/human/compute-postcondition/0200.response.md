Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n // 2`
   - `per` remains unchanged
   - `ost` contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`
   - `ans` is empty
   - `results` now contains three additional elements

2. **Loop Condition and Loop Body:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`.
   - Since `ans` is currently empty, there are no elements to iterate over in this iteration.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must contain at least one element. 

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `ans` needing to contain at least one element. All other states remain as they are because the loop does not depend on `per`, `ost`, `i`, or `results` for its execution.

**State:**
**`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `ans` must contain at least one element, `results` now contains three additional elements**
