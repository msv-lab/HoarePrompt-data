The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The problem description provides constraints and relationships for variables but does not mention any parameters being passed to the function. Given the output cases, it seems the function might internally handle some operations based on predefined conditions and constraints.

Based on the constraints and relationships provided, the function likely performs some operations on an array `a` where the length of `a` is `n` and each element `a_i` is equal to `i` for all integers `i` in the range `[1, n]`. The operations must ensure that after execution, the GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 cover all numbers from 1 to `n`, and all elements in the array `a` must satisfy `a_i ≤ 10^{18}`.

Since no specific output cases are provided beyond the constraints, we can only describe the general behavior expected from the function.
