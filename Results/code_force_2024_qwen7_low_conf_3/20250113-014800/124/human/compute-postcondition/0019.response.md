`results` is a list containing two additional elements, which are the string representations of the elements in `x` joined by spaces. The code appends to `results` a new element, which is the string representation of `x` elements joined by spaces. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the `results` list now includes its original two elements and one new element: the string representations of `x` elements joined by spaces.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing its original two elements and the string representations of `x` elements joined by spaces; `x` remains unchanged**
