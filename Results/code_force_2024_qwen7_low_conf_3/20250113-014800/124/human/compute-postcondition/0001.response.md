The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the array `a` is not modified by this operation. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^2\) and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid. The length of the array `a` is `n`, and `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, `n`], and all elements in the array `a` must satisfy `a_i \leq 10^{18}`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^2\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the length of the array `a` is `n`, and `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, `n`], and all elements in the array `a` must satisfy `a_i \leq 10^{18}`.**
