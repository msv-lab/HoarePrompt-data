The code appends the length of `ans` to `results`. Given that `ans` is the element in `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`, and `i` is `n // 2`, the length of `ans` remains the same as before the append operation. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is the element in `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`, `results` has one more element which is the length of `ans`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1**
