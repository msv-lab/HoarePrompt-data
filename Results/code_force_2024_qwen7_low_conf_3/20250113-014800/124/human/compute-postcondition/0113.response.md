According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop will execute as long as `ans` contains at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `i` is 8
- `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`
- `per` is 8
- `ost` is unchanged
- `ans` must contain at least one element
- `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representation of `x` joined by spaces
- `t` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` must contain at least one element, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representation of `x` joined by spaces, `t` is 1**
