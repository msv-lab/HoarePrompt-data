First, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

- `ans = ans2[ans1.index(n)]`

Given:
- `ans1` is `[8]`
- `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, and it is specified to be 8.

We need to find the index of `n` (which is 8) in `ans1`. Since `ans1` is `[8]`, the index of 8 in `ans1` is 0.

So, `ans` will be assigned the value at index 0 of `ans2`, which is `[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `ans` is `[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]`
- All other variables (`total`, `data`, `a`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `index`, `results`, `t`, and `n`) remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is an unspecified integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is a list of integers where `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, 8], `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 8, `ans` is `[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]**
