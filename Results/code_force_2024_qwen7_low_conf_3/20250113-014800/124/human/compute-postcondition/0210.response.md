Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Information**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `results` contains the element `' '.join(map(str, x))`
   - `ans` is not an empty list

2. **Loop Structure**: The loop is structured as follows:
   ```python
   for x in ans:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `ans`.
   - For the loop to continue, `ans` must not be an empty list. This ensures there are elements left to iterate over.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `x` represents each element in `ans`, we know that `ans` had at least one element for the current iteration to occur.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, `ans` should not become an empty list.

5. **Output the Updated State**:
   - The updated state should reflect that `ans` is still a non-empty list, and `results` contains the element `' '.join(map(str, x))` from the previous iteration.

Based on this reasoning, the updated state is:

**State: **`results` contains the element `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` is not an empty list** (ensuring `ans` is non-empty for the next iteration)**
