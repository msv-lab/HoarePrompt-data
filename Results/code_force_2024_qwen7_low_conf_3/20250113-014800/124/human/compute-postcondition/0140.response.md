Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is unspecified, `pos` is unspecified, `n` must be greater than or equal to `pos + 1`. If the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` is true, then `ost` contains `i`. If the condition is false, the state of the program remains as per the precondition.**
