Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than or equal to `n // 2 - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times (where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed), and `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`. If `i > n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` will have the values `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times; otherwise, `ans` remains `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Value of `i`:** The initial value of `i` is `n // 2`. The loop starts with `i = 3` and increments by `4` each time (`range(3, n - 1, 4)`). The loop continues as long as `i <= n - 1`.

2. **Condition to Continue Loop:** The loop condition `i > n // 2 - 2` ensures that the loop stops when `i` reaches a point where further increments would exceed `n - 1`. This condition also determines whether the appended list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` is `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` or not.

3. **Appending to `ans`:** Each time the loop runs, the list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` is appended to `ans`. Since `i` starts at `3` and increments by `4` each time, the values of `i` will eventually reach `n // 2 - 2` and stop.

4. **Final Value of `i`:** After the loop completes, `i` will be the last valid value of `i` that satisfies `i > n // 2 - 2`, which is `n // 2 + 7` (since `i` increments by `4`).

5. **Value of `pos`:** `pos` is updated to `i + 2`, so it will be `n // 2 + 9` at the end of the loop.

6. **Number of Times the Loop Executes:** The number of times the loop executes is determined by the difference between `n // 2 + 7` and `n // 2 - 2` divided by `4` (since `i` increases by `4` each time). This results in `k` repetitions of the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` in `ans`.

### Summary:
- The loop will continue until `i` exceeds `n // 2 - 2`.
- `i` will take values such as `n // 2 - 1`, `n // 2 + 3`, `n // 2 + 7`, etc., depending on how many times the loop executes.
- `ans` will contain the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times.
- `pos` will be `n // 2 + 9` at the end of the loop.

Thus, the final state after all iterations is described as above.
