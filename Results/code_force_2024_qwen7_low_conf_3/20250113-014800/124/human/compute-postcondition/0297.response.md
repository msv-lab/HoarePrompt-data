Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`.
   - `k` must be at least 1.
   - `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`.
   - `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]`, or `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if its length exceeds 3.
   - `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop.
   - `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and `' '.join(map(str, x))`.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`.
   - Since `ans` must contain at least one element, the loop can execute as long as there are elements left in `ans`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the start of the loop, `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - After processing each element `x` in the loop, the number of elements in `ans` decreases by one.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must have at least two elements remaining.

Given this analysis, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `i` remains unchanged because the loop body does not directly modify `i`.
- `k` remains unchanged because the loop body does not directly modify `k`.
- `ans` must now contain at least two elements since we are starting the next iteration.
- `pos` remains unchanged because the loop body does not directly modify `pos`.
- `ost` remains unchanged because the loop body does not directly modify `ost`.
- `per` remains unchanged because the loop body does not directly modify `per`.
- `results` remains unchanged because the loop body does not directly modify `results`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`, `k` must be at least 1, `ans` must contain at least two elements, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]`, or `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if its length exceeds 3, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and `' '.join(map(str, x))`**
