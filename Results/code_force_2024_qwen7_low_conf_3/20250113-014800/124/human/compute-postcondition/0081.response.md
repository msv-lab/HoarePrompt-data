To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step:

### Initial Conditions:
- `i` is initially 8.
- `n` is either 6 or 8.
- `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5, 11]`.
- `pos` is 8.
- `per` is either 2 or 7 depending on the condition `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`. Given that `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` will be 7 because `(6 - 1) % 4 == 3` and `(8 - 1) % 4 == 3`, neither of which satisfy `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`.
- `ost` contains `[9, 9]`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
    if i > n // 2:
        if i > 8:
            ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])
        else:
            ost.append(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `i`:** `i` starts at 8 and decreases by 12 each iteration.
2. **Range of `i`:** `i` will iterate from `per` down to `n // 2`, stepping by `-12`.

Given `per` is 8 and `n` is either 6 or 8:
- If `n` is 6, `n // 2` is 3. So, `i` will start at 8 and go down to 3 (inclusive).
- If `n` is 8, `n // 2` is 4. So, `i` will start at 8 and go down to 4 (inclusive).

Let's examine the possible values of `i` and their effects on `ans` and `ost`:

#### Case 1: `n = 6`
- `i` starts at 8 and decreases by 12 each time.
- The only possible value of `i` in this range is 8 itself since `i` will not reach `n // 2` (which is 3).

**First Iteration:**
- `i` is 8.
- Since `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`), `ans` will be updated with `[8, 4, 0]`.
- `ost` will remain unchanged.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 8.
- `n` is 6.
- `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]`.
- `per` is 8.
- `ost` remains `[9, 9]`.

#### Case 2: `n = 8`
- `i` starts at 8 and decreases by 12 each time.
- The only possible value of `i` in this range is 8 itself since `i` will not reach `n // 2` (which is 4).

**First Iteration:**
- `i` is 8.
- Since `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`), `ans` will be updated with `[8, 4, 0]`.
- `ost` will remain unchanged.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 8.
- `n` is 8.
- `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]`.
- `per` is 8.
- `ost` remains `[9, 9]`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` will never decrease below `n // 2` (which is 3 or 4 depending on `n`), the loop will only execute once, updating `ans` with `[8, 4, 0]` and leaving `ost` unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]`, `per` is 8, and `ost` contains `[9, 9]`.**
