The code appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `n - 3` minus 12. The value of `n` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `i`. However, we know that `i >= n - 15`.

The initial state of `ans` is given as a list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times. Since `i` is only compared against 8, and we do not have the value of `i`, we can't determine if the additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` are added or not. We will keep this in our output.

After appending `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to `ans`, the value of `ans` changes, but the values of `i`, `pos`, `ost`, and `per` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than or equal to `n - 15`; `ans` is the initial list plus `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`; `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`; `ost` is `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8`, otherwise it is `[7]`; `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`.**
