`ost` appends the value of `i` to itself. Since `i` is greater than `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8, and satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, the possible values for `i` are 7 and 9 (since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `n // 2` is 3 or 4, and the only odd number greater than 3 is 7). However, since `i` is also less than or equal to 8, the only possible value for `i` is 7.

Therefore, `ost` will contain the value 7 appended to the existing list of values that satisfy the condition. The initial value of `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that satisfy the condition, which are the odd numbers greater than `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8. Since `n` is at least 8, the only such value is 7.

After appending, `ost` will now include 7, making it `[7]`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` is `[7]`, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`**
