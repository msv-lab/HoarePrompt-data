Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 7
   - `n` is greater than 12
   - `per` is 8
   - `ost` is an empty list
   - `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]`
   - `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, and `t` is 1
   - `pos` is 9

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `i` in the range `3, n - 1, 4`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 7.

4. **Next Iteration Calculation:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 4 each time.
   - Current value of `i` is 7.
   - Next value of `i` would be \( 7 + 4 = 11 \).

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The loop condition is `3 <= i < n - 1`.
   - Given `n > 12`, we need to check if `11 < n - 1`.
   - Since `n > 12`, `n - 1 > 11`, so `11 < n - 1` holds true.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be 11.
   - `n` remains greater than 12.
   - `per` remains 8.
   - `ost` remains an empty list.
   - `ans` remains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]`.
   - `results` remains the same as it does not change within the loop body (assuming no modifications to `results` in the loop body).
   - `t` remains 1.
   - `pos` remains 9.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 11, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, and `t` is 1; `pos` is 9.**
