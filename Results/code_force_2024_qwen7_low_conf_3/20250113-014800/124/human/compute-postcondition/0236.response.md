The code appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. Since `i` is at least `n // 2 + 10` and is either odd and not divisible by 4 or divisible by 4, and `ost` was initially empty, appending `i` to `ost` means `ost` now contains `[i]`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is at least `n // 2 + 10` and is either odd and not divisible by 4 or divisible by 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `i` is greater than `n // 2`, and `ost` is `[i]`**.
