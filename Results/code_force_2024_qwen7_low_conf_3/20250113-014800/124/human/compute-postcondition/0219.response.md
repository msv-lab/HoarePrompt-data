The code `ost = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `ost`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` and has one additional element compared to the previous iteration, `n` is an integer equal to `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1, `pos` is 0**
