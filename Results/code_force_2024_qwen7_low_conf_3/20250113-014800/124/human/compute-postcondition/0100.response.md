The code snippet appends a string to the `results` list. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the provided initial state, and no assignment is made to `x` within the given code snippet. Therefore, the code snippet alone does not provide enough information to determine the exact value that will be appended to `results`. Given the initial state and the lack of further context about `x`, we can only state that `results` will be modified by appending a string created from `x`.

Since `x` is not defined, the exact string that will be appended cannot be determined. However, we know that the string will be created using `map(str, x)` and then joined with spaces.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ost` must have at least one element, `ans` must be correctly formed based on the length of `ost`, `results` is modified by appending a string created from `x` using `map(str, x)` and joining the elements with spaces.**
