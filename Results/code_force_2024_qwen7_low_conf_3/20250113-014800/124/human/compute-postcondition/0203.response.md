According to the code, the loop iterates `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `i` is `n // 2`
- `per` remains unchanged
- `ost` is an empty list
- `ans` is a list containing the elements from `ost` (if any)
- `results` is a list with an additional element for each iteration of the loop, where each element is a string representation of the elements in `x` joined by spaces.

To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration, we need to consider what happens inside the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we can infer the following:

1. The variable `i` starts at `n // 2`.
2. The variable `per` remains unchanged.
3. The variable `ost` remains an empty list.
4. The variable `ans` will contain elements from `ost` if any.
5. The variable `results` will have an additional element for each iteration of the loop, where each element is a string representation of the elements in `x` joined by spaces.

Since the loop is iterating `t` times, after each iteration, `results` will have one more element. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `results` will have one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's adjust the states step-by-step:

1. `i` starts at `n // 2` and does not change during the loop.
2. `per` remains unchanged.
3. `ost` remains an empty list.
4. `ans` remains a list containing the elements from `ost` (if any).
5. `results` will have one more element added.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the elements from `ost` (if any), `results` is a list with one additional element compared to the previous iteration**
