The value of `index` is incremented by 1. Initially, `index` is 2, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is an unspecified integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is a list of integers where `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, `n`], all elements in the array `a` must satisfy `a_i \leq 10^{18}`, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0**
