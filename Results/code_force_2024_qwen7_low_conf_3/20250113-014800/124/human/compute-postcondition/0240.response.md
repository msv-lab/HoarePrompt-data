Postcondition: ***`i` is at least `n // 2 + 11`, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, and `ost` is a list containing either `[i]` if `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` is true, or remains unchanged if the condition is false.***
