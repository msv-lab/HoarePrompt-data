The code appends the string representation of the list `x` (joined by spaces) to the list `results`. Since the exact content of `x` is not specified, we will keep it as `x` in the output state.

- `i` remains unchanged and is still 8.
- `n` remains unchanged and is still the value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `per` remains unchanged and is still 8.
- `ost` remains unchanged.
- `ans` remains unchanged and must still contain at least one element.
- `results` is updated to include the string representation of `x` (joined by spaces).
- `t` remains unchanged and is still 1.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` must contain at least one element, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representation of `x` joined by spaces, `t` is 1**
