The code `continue` is used inside a loop and skips the rest of the current iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, we assume it is within a loop structure that iterates over certain conditions. The variables `i`, `n`, `per`, `ost`, `ans`, `results`, and `t` are not modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, `t` is 1.**
