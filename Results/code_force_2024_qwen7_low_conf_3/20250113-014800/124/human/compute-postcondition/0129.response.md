The code appends a new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 7, the new list will be `[7, 8, 9]`.

After the append operation, the list `ans` will be `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 7, `n` is greater than 12, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, and `t` is 1; `pos` is 5.**
