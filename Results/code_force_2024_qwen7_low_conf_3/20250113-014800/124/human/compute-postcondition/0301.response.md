The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, each element separated by a newline character. This operation does not change the values of any variables, including `t`, `n`, `index`, or `results`. It only modifies the output that will be displayed.

Output State: **`t` is the initial value, `n` is the last value read from `data[index]`, `index` is `2 + t`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` from all iterations of the loop. The contents of `results` are written to the standard output, each element separated by a newline.**
