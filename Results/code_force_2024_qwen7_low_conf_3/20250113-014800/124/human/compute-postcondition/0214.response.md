Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, `ans` is not an empty list**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ans`.
- For each iteration, the loop appends a string representation of the list `x` (with elements joined by spaces) to the list `results`.
- This process continues until all elements in `ans` have been processed.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `results` will contain the string representations of all elements in `ans`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `ans` is an empty list), then `results` will also be an empty list, but the condition `ans is not an empty list` ensures that `results` will not be empty unless `ans` is explicitly an empty list at the start of the loop.
