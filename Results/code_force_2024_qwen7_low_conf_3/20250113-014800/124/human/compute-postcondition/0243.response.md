Postcondition: **`i` is \( n \), `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is \( n // 2 + 9 \), and `ost` is a list containing `[i]` appended to its previous value if the condition \((i \% 2 != 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\) is true, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
