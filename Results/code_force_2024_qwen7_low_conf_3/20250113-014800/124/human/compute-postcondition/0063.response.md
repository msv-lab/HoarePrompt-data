To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start and iterate. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - `i` is initially 8.
   - `n` is either 6 or 8.
   - `ans` contains [3, 4, 5, 11].
   - `pos` is 8.
   - `per` is either 2 or 7.
   - `ost` contains [9, 9].

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   The loop runs as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
   ```
   This means:
   - The loop starts with `i = per`.
   - It decrements `i` by 12 each time.
   - It continues until `i` is less than `n // 2`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = per`.
   - Given `i` is 8, we need to check if this matches `per`.

4. **Check the value of `per`:**
   - `per` is either 2 or 7.
   - Since `i` is 8, it must match `per`, so `per` must be 8.

5. **Check the condition for the loop to start:**
   - The loop starts when `i >= per` and continues as long as `i >= n // 2`.
   - With `per` being 8, the loop will start if `8 >= 6 // 2` (since `n` is either 6 or 8).

6. **Evaluate the condition `8 >= 6 // 2`:**
   - If `n` is 6, `6 // 2` is 3, and `8 >= 3` is true.
   - If `n` is 8, `8 // 2` is 4, and `8 >= 4` is true.

Since both cases are valid, the loop will start regardless of whether `n` is 6 or 8.

7. **Final state adjustments:**
   - `i` should be set to `per`, which is 8.
   - `n` must be either 6 or 8.
   - `per` must be 8.

The final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8**.
