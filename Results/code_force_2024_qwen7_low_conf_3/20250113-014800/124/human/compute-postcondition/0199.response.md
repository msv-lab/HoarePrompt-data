The code snippet appends a string representation of the list `x` to the list `results`. The list `x` is implicitly converted to a space-separated string using `map(str, x)` and `join`.

Since the initial state does not provide the exact values of the elements in `x`, we cannot determine the exact string that will be appended to `results`. However, we know that `x` is a list that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. This means `i` is either odd and not divisible by 4, or divisible by 4, and greater than `n // 2`.

The initial state is as follows:
- `i` is `n // 2`
- `per` remains unchanged
- `ost` contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`
- `ans` is empty
- `results` now contains two additional elements

After the code executes, `results` will have its third element added, which is a string representation of the list `x`.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` contains at least one element that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `ans` is empty, `results` now contains three additional elements**
