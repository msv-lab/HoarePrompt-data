The code appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the `ans` list. Since `ans` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is a list that gets updated. The values of `i`, `n`, `pos`, and `per` are such that `i` is greater than 8 and greater than `n // 2`, and `i` satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values of `i - 4` and `i - 8`. 

The output state will reflect the addition of this list to `ans`.

Output State: **`ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `i` is greater than 8 and greater than `n // 2`, `pos` is unspecified, `n` is unspecified, and `per` must be greater than or equal to `n // 2`; `ans` now includes the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`**
