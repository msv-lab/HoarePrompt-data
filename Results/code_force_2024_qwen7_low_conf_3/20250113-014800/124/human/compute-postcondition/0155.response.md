Postcondition: **`ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `pos` is unspecified, `n` is unspecified, `per` is equal to `n`, and `(n - 1) % 4 != 2`, and the condition `(n - 2) % 4 != 2` holds. Additionally, the current value of `(n - 3) % 4` is 2**
