The code snippet provided is incomplete and does not show the full context of the `results` list or the `x` variable. However, based on the given code snippet:

```python
results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))
```

This line of code appends a string representation of the elements in the list `x` (joined by spaces) to the `results` list.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `results` and `x`, we can only describe the impact on these variables.

- `results` is a list that now contains one additional element, which is the string representation of the elements in `x` joined by spaces.
- `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing one additional element, which is the string representation of the elements in `x` joined by spaces; `x` remains unchanged.**
