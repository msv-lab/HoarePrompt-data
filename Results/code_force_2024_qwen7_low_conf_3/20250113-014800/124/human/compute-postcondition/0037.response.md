The code assigns the value of `i + 2` to `pos`. This updates the value of `pos` but does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, or any other variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 4`, `n` is the same, `ans` contains at least `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]` and `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged as `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, and `pos` is `i + 2`**
