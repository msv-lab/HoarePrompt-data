`results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string representation of the list `x` (converted to strings and joined with spaces) to the list `results`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the given code snippet. Since `x` is not defined, the code cannot be executed, and the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`, `k` must be at least 1, `ans` must contain at least one element, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]` or `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if its length exceeds 3, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.**
