`results` contains two elements, both of which are `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` must have at least one element. The code appends `' '.join(map(str, x))` to the list `results`. Since the initial state already has two elements in `results` that are equal to `' '.join(map(str, x))`, appending this again will add another instance of the same value to `results`.

Therefore, after the code is executed, `results` will contain three elements, all of which are equal to `' '.join(map(str, x))`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` contains three elements, all of which are equal to `' '.join(map(str, x))`; `ans` must have at least one element**
