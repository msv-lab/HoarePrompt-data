According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` within the list `ans`. The loop iterates over each element in `ans`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is 8
- `n` is either 6 or 8
- `per` is 8
- `ost` must have at least one element
- `ans` must be correctly formed based on the length of `ost`
- `results` is modified by appending a string created from `x` using `map(str, x)` and joining the elements with spaces.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must have at least one more element, and `x` must be one of those elements.

Given the current state:
- `i` remains 8 (it does not change within the loop)
- `n` remains either 6 or 8 (it does not change within the loop)
- `per` remains 8 (it does not change within the loop)
- `ost` must still have at least one element (it does not change within the loop)
- `ans` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must have at least two elements, and `x` will be the next element in `ans`.

State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ost` must have at least one element, `ans` must have at least two elements, and `x` is the second element in `ans`**
