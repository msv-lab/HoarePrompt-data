Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. Additionally, `(n - 1) % 4` is not equal to 2, and depending on the condition in the if statement, either `per` is `n - 2` or `per` is `n - 3` if `(n - 3) % 4 == 2` holds true.***
