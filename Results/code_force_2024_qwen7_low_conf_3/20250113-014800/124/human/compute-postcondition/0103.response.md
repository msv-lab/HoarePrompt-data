Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `i` is 8.
   - `n` is either 6 or 8.
   - `per` is 8.
   - `ost` must have at least one element.
   - `ans` must have at least two elements.
   - `x` is the second element in `ans`.
   - `results` contains `' '.join(map(str, x))`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `ans` using the variable `x`.

3. **Determine the Current State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was set to the second element of `ans`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` needs to be set to the third element of `ans`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `x` will be the third element in `ans`.
   - Since `x` is being updated to the next element in `ans`, `ans` must have at least three elements.
   - All other states (`i`, `n`, `per`, `ost`, `results`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` remains 8.
   - `n` remains either 6 or 8.
   - `per` remains 8.
   - `ost` must have at least one element (unchanged).
   - `ans` must have at least three elements (since we need to access the third element).
   - `x` is now the third element in `ans`.
   - `results` contains `' '.join(map(str, x))`.

Therefore, the new state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, `ost` must have at least one element, `ans` must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ans`, `results` contains `' '.join(map(str, x))**.
