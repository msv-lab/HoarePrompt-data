The code `ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])` appends a list containing three elements to the list `ans`. The first element is `i`, the second element is `i - 4`, and the third element is `i - 8`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `i` or `ans`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` now contains the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`**
