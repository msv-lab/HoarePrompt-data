The code `per = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `per`. The previous value of `per` was `n`, and now it is updated to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `pos` is unspecified, `n` is unspecified, `per` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `(n - 1) % 4` is 2.**
