Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 8
   - `n` is either 6 or 8
   - `per` is 8
   - If `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`), `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]`. Otherwise, `ost` contains `[8]`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Conditions Analysis:**
   - The loop starts from `per` (which is 8) and decrements by 12 until it reaches or falls below `n // 2`.
   - Since `n` is either 6 or 8, `n // 2` is either 3 or 4.
   - Given that `i` is currently 8, the loop will start from 8 and decrement by 12, which means `i` will never reach a value that is less than or equal to `n // 2` (since the minimum value `i` would reach is 8 - 12 = -4, which is less than 3 or 4).

4. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 8
   - `n` is either 6 or 8
   - `per` is 8
   - Since `i` is 8 and the loop decrements by 12, `i` will not change and will always be 8. Therefore, the condition `i > 4` will always be true.

5. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` will always be 8 and the loop will continue as long as `i > 4`, the loop will continue to execute.
   - The only thing that changes is the value of `i` within the loop, but since it is fixed at 8, no adjustment is needed for the loop to continue.
   - The state remains the same because the loop will continue to execute with `i` still being 8.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 8
- `n` is either 6 or 8
- `per` is 8
- If `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`), `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]`. Otherwise, `ost` contains `[8]`

Since the loop will continue to execute with `i` being 8, no additional adjustments are needed for the next iteration.

**Answer:**
State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `per` is 8, if `i > 4` (which is `n // 2`), `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0]`. Otherwise, `ost` contains `[8]`**
