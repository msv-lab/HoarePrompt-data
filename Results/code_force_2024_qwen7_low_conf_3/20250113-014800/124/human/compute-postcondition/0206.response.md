`ans` is assigned the value of `ans2[ans1.index(n)]`. Here, `n` is an integer equal to `data[index]`, which means `n` is known. However, without knowing the values of `ans1` and `ans2`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. The only thing we know is that `ans` is now set to the element in `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is the element in `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`, `results` is a list with one additional element compared to the previous iteration, `n` is an integer equal to `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1**
