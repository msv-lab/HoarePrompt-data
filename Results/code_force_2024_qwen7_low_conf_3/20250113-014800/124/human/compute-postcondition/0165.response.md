`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is greater than or equal to `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8, and it satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. Since `i` is less than or equal to 8, the possible values of `i` are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (since these are the only numbers in this range that satisfy the condition). Therefore, `ost` will contain one of these values.

Output State: **`ost` contains one of the values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, `i` is greater than or equal to `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8, `pos` is unspecified, `n` is unspecified, and `per` must be greater than or equal to `n // 2`.**
