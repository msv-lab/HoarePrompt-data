Postcondition: ***`ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `pos` is unspecified, `n` is unspecified, `per` is equal to either `n` or `n - 3`, and the conditions `(n - 1) % 4 != 2` and `(n - 2) % 4 != 2` hold. Additionally, if `(n - 3) % 4 == 2`, then `per` is set to `n - 3`.***
