`results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string representation of the third element in `ans` to the list `results`. The value of `x` is the third element in `ans`, and `map(str, x)` converts each element of `x` to a string, and `' '.join(...)` joins these strings with a space.

Since `ans` must have at least three elements, let's denote the third element of `ans` as `x`. The value of `x` is unchanged from its previous state, but now `results` will contain the joined string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`i` remains 8, `n` remains either 6 or 8, `per` remains 8, `ost` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `x` remains the third element in `ans`, and `results` contains the string representation of the third element in `ans`.**
