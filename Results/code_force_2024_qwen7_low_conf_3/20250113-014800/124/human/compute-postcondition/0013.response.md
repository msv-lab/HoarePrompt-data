The code appends the length of the list `ans` to the `results` list as a string. The length of `ans` is 2 because `ans` is `[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]`. 

Therefore, the value of `results` changes from an empty list to `['2']`.

Output State: **`total` is an unspecified integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is a list of integers where `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, 8], `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 3, `results` is `['2']`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 8, `ans` is `[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]`**
