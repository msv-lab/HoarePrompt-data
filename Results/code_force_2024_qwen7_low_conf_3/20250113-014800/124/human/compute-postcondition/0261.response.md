Postcondition: **`i` is greater than `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`**
