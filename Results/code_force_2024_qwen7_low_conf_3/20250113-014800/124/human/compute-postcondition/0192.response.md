Postcondition: ***`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged. `ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If `len(ost) == 3`, `ans` includes `[a, b, c]` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the first three elements of `ost`. If `len(ost) == 4`, `ans` contains `[1, ost[0], ost[1], 2, ost[2], ost[3]]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
