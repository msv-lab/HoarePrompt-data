The code `per = n - 1` updates the value of `per` by subtracting 1 from `n`. Given the initial state, `n` is 8, so `per` will be assigned the value `8 - 1`, which is 7. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is 8, `ans` contains [3, 4, 5, 11], `pos` is 8, `per` is 7, and `ost` contains [9, 9]**
