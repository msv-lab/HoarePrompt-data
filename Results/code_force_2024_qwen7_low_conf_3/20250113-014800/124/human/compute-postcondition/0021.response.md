The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables when `continue` is executed, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`total` is an unspecified integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is a list of integers where `a_i = i` for all integers `i` in the range [1, 8], `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 3, `results` is `['2', '2 6 8', '3 5 7']`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 8, `ans` is `[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]`.**
