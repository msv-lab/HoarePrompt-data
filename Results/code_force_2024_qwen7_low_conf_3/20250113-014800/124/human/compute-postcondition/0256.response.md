Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. Additionally, depending on the condition in the if statement, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, covering all possible cases based on the given preconditions and the if-else conditions.
