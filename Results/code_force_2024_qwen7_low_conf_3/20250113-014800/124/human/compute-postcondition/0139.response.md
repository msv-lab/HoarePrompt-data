The code `ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. Since `i` satisfies the condition `i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0` and `i > n // 2`, and the initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to `pos + 1`, the value of `i` is added to the list `ost`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is unspecified, `pos` is unspecified, `n` must be greater than or equal to `pos + 1`, `ost` contains `i`, the current value of `i` is such that `i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0` and `i > n // 2`**
