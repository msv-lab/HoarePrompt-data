The code snippet appends a string representation of the length of `ans` to the `results` list. However, the length of `ans` is not directly changed by this line of code. The variables `i`, `per`, `ost`, and `ans` remain in their original state. Therefore, the output state does not change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `ans` is updated based on the length of `ost` as specified, and `results` now contains one additional element which is a string representing the length of `ans`.**
