The code `ans = []` initializes an empty list for `ans`. This assignment operation replaces the existing `ans` list with an empty one. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` and has one additional element compared to the previous iteration, `n` is an integer equal to `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1.**
