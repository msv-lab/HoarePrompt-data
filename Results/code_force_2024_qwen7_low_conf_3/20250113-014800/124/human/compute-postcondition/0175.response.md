`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `i - 12`, and the condition `i - 12 >= n // 2` determines whether this operation occurs. If the condition is true, then `ost.append(i)` will append the value `i - 12` to `ost`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i - 12`, `per` is unchanged, `ost` is updated with `i - 12` if `i - 12 >= n // 2`, `ans` is unchanged.**
