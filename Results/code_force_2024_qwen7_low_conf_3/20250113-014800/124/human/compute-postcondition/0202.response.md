Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the elements from `ost` (if any), `results` is a list with an additional element for each iteration of the loop, where each element is a string representation of the elements in `x` joined by spaces.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` starts at `n // 2`.
   - `per` remains unchanged.
   - `ost` initially contains integers from `pos + 1` to `n` that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - `ans` is updated based on the length of `ost`.
   - `results` starts with one element, which is a string representing the length of `ans`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`.
   - For each iteration, `results` appends a string that joins the elements of `x` with spaces.
   
3. **After Loop Completion**:
   - Since `ost` is filtered based on the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, if no elements satisfy this condition, `ost` becomes an empty list.
   - As the loop progresses, `ans` will either contain elements from `ost` or become an empty list depending on the condition.
   - `results` will accumulate strings representing the elements in `x` for each iteration of the loop.

4. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains `n // 2` as the loop does not change its value.
   - `per` remains unchanged.
   - `ost` will be an empty list if no elements satisfy the condition.
   - `ans` will be a list containing the elements from `ost` (if any).
   - `results` will contain a string for each iteration, representing the elements in `x` joined by spaces.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final state is as described above.
