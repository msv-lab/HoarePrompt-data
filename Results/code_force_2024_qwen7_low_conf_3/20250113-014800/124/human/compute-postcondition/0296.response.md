`results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string representation of the list `x` to the list `results`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be converted to a string and joined by spaces before being appended to `results`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not given, let's consider the possible values of `x` from the initial state of `ost`:

- If `ost` is `[7, 7]`, then `x` could be `[7, 7]`.
- If `ost` is `[7, 7, 7]`, then `x` could be `[7, 7, 7]`.
- If `ost` is `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]`, then `x` could be `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]`.
- If `ost` is `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]`, then `x` could be `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]`.

The value of `results` will be updated to include the string representation of `x` with elements joined by spaces. For example, if `x` is `[7, 7, 7]`, the new `results` will be `['ans', '7 7 7']`.

The other variables (`i`, `k`, `pos`, `ost`, `per`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`, `k` must be at least 1, `ans` must contain at least one element, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` contains either `[7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7]` or `[7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]` if its length exceeds 3, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the value of `i` at the start of the loop, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and `' '.join(map(str, x))`**
