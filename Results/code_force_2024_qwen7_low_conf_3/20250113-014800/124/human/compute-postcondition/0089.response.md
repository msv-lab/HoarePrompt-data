The code `ans.append([ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]])` appends a new list containing the elements of `ost` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0]`. The list `ost` is `[9, 9, 9]`. After appending, the new list `[9, 9, 9]` will be added to `ans`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `ans` initially is `[8, 4, 0]`.
2. `ost` is `[9, 9, 9]`.
3. The code appends `[9, 9, 9]` to `ans`, so `ans` becomes `[8, 4, 0, [9, 9, 9]]`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is 8 (unchanged)
- `n` is either 6 or 8 (unchanged)
- `ans` is now `[8, 4, 0, [9, 9, 9]]`
- `per` is 8 (unchanged)
- `ost` is `[9, 9, 9]` (unchanged)

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `ans` is [8, 4, 0, [9, 9, 9]], `per` is 8, and `ost` is [9, 9, 9]**.
