First, let's understand the initial state:
- `i` is `n // 2 + 3`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 8
- If `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` contains the list `[4k - 1, 4k, 4k + 1]` where `4k - 1` is the current value of `i`, and `pos` is `n // 2 + 1`.

Next, let's analyze the code snippet:
```python
ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])
```
This line appends a list containing three elements (which are consecutive integers) to the list `ans`. Since `i` is defined in the initial state, we know `i` is `n // 2 + 3`. Therefore, the list added to `ans` will be `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`.

Now, let's determine if the condition for `ans` is met:
- `i` is `n // 2 + 3`
- We need to check if `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`

Substitute the value of `i` into the condition:
\[ n // 2 + 3 > n // 2 - 2 \]

Simplifying this inequality:
\[ 3 > -2 \]
This is always true.

Since the condition is always true, `ans` will contain the list `[4k - 1, 4k, 4k + 1]` where `4k - 1` is the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is `n // 2 + 3`, the list added to `ans` is `[n // 2 + 2, n // 2 + 3, n // 2 + 4]`.

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- `ans` is updated to include the new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, which is `[n // 2 + 2, n // 2 + 3, n // 2 + 4]`.
- The value of `pos` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[n // 2 + 2, n // 2 + 3, n // 2 + 4]`, and `pos` is `n // 2 + 1`.**
