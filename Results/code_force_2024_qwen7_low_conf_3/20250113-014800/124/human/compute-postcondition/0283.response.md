The code snippet appends the list `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]` (which is `[7, 7, 7]`) to the list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `pos`, `ost`, and `per`. Let's update the value of `ans`.

Given that `ost` is `[7, 7, 7]`, appending this list to `ans` will add `[7, 7, 7]` as the last element in `ans`.

So, the updated `ans` will have its original elements plus the new list `[7, 7, 7]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 9 - 12 * k`, `ans` is the list `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9] repeated `k` times, plus additional elements `[9, 5, 1]` if `i > 8` and `i_end + 12 > 8`, otherwise it remains as `[n // 2 + 7, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 9]` repeated `k` times plus `[7, 7, 7]`, `pos` is `n // 2 + 9`, `ost` contains `[7, 7, 7]` and its length is 3, `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the value of `i` at the start of the loop.**
