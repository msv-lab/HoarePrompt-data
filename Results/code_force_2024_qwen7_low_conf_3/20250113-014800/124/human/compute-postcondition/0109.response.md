The code `ans = ans2[ans1.index(n)]` assigns the value at the index of `n` in `ans1` to `ans`. Here, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`. However, the actual values of `ans1` and `ans2` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. But we know that `ans` now holds the value from `ans2` at the index found in `ans1` where `n` is located.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` is the value from `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, and `t` is 1.**
