To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 8
- `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`
- `per` is 8
- `ost` is an empty list
- `ans` is an empty list
- `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`
- `t` is 1
- `pos` is 0

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(3, n - 1, 4):
    if i > n // 2 - 2:
        ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])
        pos = i + 2
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n - 2` with a step of 4. The loop continues as long as `i <= n - 2`.
2. **Condition Inside Loop**: The loop checks if `i > n // 2 - 2`. If true, it appends `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to `ans` and updates `pos` to `i + 2`.

### Observations from Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration (`i = 3`): `i` becomes 3, `n` must be greater than 12, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`, `pos` is 5.
- After 2 iterations (`i = 7`): `i` becomes 7, `n` must be greater than 12, `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]`, `pos` is 9.
- After 3 iterations (`i = 11`): `i` becomes 11, `n` must be greater than 12, `ans` contains `[[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13]]`, `pos` is 13, `results` is `'[3 4 5][7 8 9][11 12 13]13'`.

### General Pattern:
- Each time the loop runs, `i` increases by 4.
- `n` must be greater than the highest value of `i` encountered.
- `ans` accumulates lists of the form `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`.
- `pos` is updated to `i + 2` each time the condition is met.

### Final Iteration Consideration:
- The loop will stop when `i` exceeds `n - 2`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the largest multiple of 4 less than or equal to `n - 2`.

### Final Output State:
- `i` will be the largest multiple of 4 less than or equal to `n - 2`, which is `n - 2 - (n - 2) % 4`.
- `n` must be greater than the final value of `i`.
- `ans` will contain all lists `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` where `i` starts from 3 and increments by 4 until `i` exceeds `n - 2`.
- `pos` will be the last value of `i + 2`.
- `results` will be a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 less than or equal to `n - 2`, `n` is greater than the value of `i`, `per` is 8, `ost` is an empty list, `ans` contains all lists `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for `i` starting from 3 and incrementing by 4 until `i` exceeds `n - 2`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the string representation of `n`, `t` is 1, `pos` is the last value of `i + 2`.**
