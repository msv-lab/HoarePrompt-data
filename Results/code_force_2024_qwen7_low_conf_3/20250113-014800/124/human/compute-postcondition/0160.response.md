To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements for the loop based on the given code snippet:

### Loop Analysis
The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means:
- The loop starts from `per` and goes down to `n // 2` (inclusive) in steps of `-12`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `n // 2`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute
For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `i` must be greater than or equal to `n // 2`.
2. The loop should start from `per` and decrement by `-12` until it reaches or falls below `n // 2`.

### Analyzing `per`
The value of `per` is determined by:
- `per` is equal to either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n` depending on the value of `(n - 1) % 4`.
- Specifically:
  - If `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`, then `per` is `n - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `per` is set to `n - 3` if `(n - 3) % 4 == 2`.
  - If both `(n - 1) % 4 != 2` and `(n - 3) % 4 != 2`, then `per` is either `n - 2` or `n` as per these conditions.

### Ensuring the Loop Executes
To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `per` is greater than or equal to `n // 2` and that the decrement step `-12` allows `i` to reach or fall below `n // 2`.

#### Key Points:
- `per` must be greater than or equal to `n // 2`.
- The decrement step `-12` should allow the loop to progress towards `n // 2`.

Given the possible values of `per`:
- If `per` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, it is highly likely that `per` is greater than `n // 2` (assuming `n` is large enough).
- The decrement step `-12` will ensure that the loop progresses towards `n // 2`.

### Final State Adjustment
Based on the analysis, we need to ensure that `per` is appropriately set such that it is greater than or equal to `n // 2`. Given the conditions for `per`, we can conclude that the loop will execute as long as `per` is validly set according to the rules provided.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
- `per` must be greater than or equal to `n // 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `pos` is unspecified, `n` is unspecified, and `per` must be greater than or equal to `n // 2`.**
