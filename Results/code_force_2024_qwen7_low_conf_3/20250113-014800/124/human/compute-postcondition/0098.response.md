The code appends the length of `ans` to the `results` list. Since the exact structure of `ans` depends on the length of `ost`, we need to consider the different cases for the length of `ost`.

- If the length of `ost` is 1, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [1, 2, 9]]`.
- If the length of `ost` is 2, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9]]`.
- If the length of `ost` is 3, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [9, 9, 9]]`.
- If the length of `ost` is greater than 3, `ans` is `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9], [2, None, None]]`.

In all cases, the length of `ans` is 4. Therefore, `results.append(f'{len(ans)}')` will append `4` to the `results` list.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `ans` is [8, 4, 0, [1, 2, 9]] if the length of `ost` is 1, [8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9]] if the length of `ost` is 2, [8, 4, 0, [9, 9, 9]] if the length of `ost` is 3, and [8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9], [2, None, None]] if the length of `ost` is greater than 3, `per` is 8, `ost` is [9] if the length of `ost` is 1, [9, 9, 9] if the length of `ost` is 3, and [9, 9, None, None] otherwise, `results` is ['4']**
