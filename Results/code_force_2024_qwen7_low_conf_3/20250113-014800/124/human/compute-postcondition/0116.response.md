`results` appends the string representation of `x` joined by spaces. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, but it does not affect the other variables. The output state will include the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is the value of `data[index + 1]`, `per` is 8, `ost` is unchanged, `ans` must contain at least one element, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representation of `x` joined by spaces, `t` is 1**
