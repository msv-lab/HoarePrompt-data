`ans` is appended with the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`. Given the conditions in the initial state, `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), and `ost` contains one of the values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` would include the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`, but since `i` is between 3 and 8, this condition does not apply. Therefore, the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` is added to `ans`.

Output State: **`ost` contains one of the values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8; `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive); `ans` includes the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`; both `i` and `per` are greater than or equal to `n // 2`.**
