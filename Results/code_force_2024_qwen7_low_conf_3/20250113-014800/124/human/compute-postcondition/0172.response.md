Postcondition: **`i` and `per` are both greater than or equal to `n // 2`. If `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), `ost` contains the list of integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` includes the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`.**
