Postcondition: ***`i` is 8, `n` is either 6 or 8, `ans` contains `[8, 4, 0, [1, 9, 9], [2, None, None]]`, `per` is 8, and `ost` is `[9, 9, None, None]`. If the length of `ost` is 4, these values are as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the condition in the if statement.***
