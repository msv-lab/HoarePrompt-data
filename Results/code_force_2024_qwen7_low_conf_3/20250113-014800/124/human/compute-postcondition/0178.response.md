Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `per` remains unchanged, `ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` includes the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`. If `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), `ost` contains the integers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `ost` contains all integers from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - `per` is determined based on the value of `(n - 1) % 4`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates in reverse from `per` to `n // 2` with a step of `-12`.
   - If `i > n // 2` and `i > 8`, then `ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is between 3 and 8 (inclusive), and these values are appended to `ost`.

3. **Final Iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements by 12 each time, the final iteration will end when `i` reaches `n // 2`.
   - At this point, `i` will be `n // 2`, and since the decrement step is `-12`, the loop will stop as there are no more values to iterate over within the range specified.

4. **Variable Values**:
   - `i` will be `n // 2` because the loop stops when `i` is exactly `n // 2`.
   - `per` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `ost` will contain all valid integers that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` because the loop appends values until it reaches `n // 2`.
   - `ans` will contain the lists `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` for each `i` greater than 8 during the loop iterations.

5. **Non-Execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute at all (e.g., if `per` is less than `n // 2` or if the loop condition fails), then `i` will never change from its initial value (which is `per`), `per` will remain unchanged, and `ost` and `ans` will be as described above for the first iteration, but no new elements will be added to `ans` or `ost`.

Thus, the final state after all iterations is as described above.
