### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided code and annotations against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`)
1. **Calculation of Expected Sum**: The function calculates the expected sum of all subarray sums of a palindrome array of size `n` as \( \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 \). This calculation is correct because each element in the array will appear in exactly half of the subarrays.
2. **Identifying the Missing Sum**: The function correctly computes the missing sum by subtracting the actual sum of the given subarray sums from the expected sum. This ensures that the missing subarray sum is identified accurately.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`)
1. **Initial Setup**: The function sorts the subarray sums and initializes an array `a` with zeros.
2. **Central Value Placement**: The central value `a[mid]` is set to `missing_sum // (mid + 1)`. This is a critical step to ensure the symmetry of the palindrome array.
3. **Filling Left and Right Halves**: The loop iterates over the first half of the array and sets the values such that `a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]` and `a[n - 1 - i] = a[i]`. This ensures that the left and right halves mirror each other, maintaining the palindrome property.

However, there is a potential issue in the way the subarray sums are used. Specifically, the assumption that the subarray sums can directly provide the necessary differences to construct the palindrome might not hold in all cases. Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

Consider the palindrome array `[1, 2, 1]` with subarray sums `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`. The missing sum is `3`. In `func_2`, the function will set `a[1]` (the middle element) to `3 // 2 = 1` (integer division). Then, it will compute `a[0] = subarray_sums[0] - a[1] = 1 - 1 = 0` and `a[2] = subarray_sums[0] - a[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`. This results in the array `[0, 1, 0]`, which is not a palindrome.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`)
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` to find the missing sum and then `func_2` to construct the palindrome array.
3. **Printing Results**: The results are printed in the required format.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment
1. **Function 2 (`func_2`) Logic**: The current implementation of `func_2` assumes that the subarray sums can directly provide the necessary differences to construct the palindrome. This might not always hold true, especially when the subarray sums do not reflect the actual differences between elements in the palindrome array.
2. **Palindrome Construction**: The construction of the palindrome array might fail in cases where the subarray sums do not provide the correct differences. The current approach might lead to non-palindromic arrays or incorrect values.

### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment did not fully account for the potential issues in the palindrome construction process. While the overall structure of the program seems correct, the specific method of constructing the palindrome array may not always produce a valid palindrome, especially in edge cases.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is not guaranteed to produce a valid palindrome in all cases due to the assumptions made in the `func_2` function. Therefore, the program should be revised to handle these edge cases more robustly.
