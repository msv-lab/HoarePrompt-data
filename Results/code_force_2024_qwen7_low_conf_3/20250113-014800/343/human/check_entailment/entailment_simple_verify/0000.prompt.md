You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop and the given output states step by step to determine the final output state after the loop has executed.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis
    #The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `mid - 1` (inclusive). For each iteration, the loop updates the list `a` as follows:
    #- `a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n - 1 - i] = a[i]`
    #
    #This means the loop essentially mirrors the values of `subarray_sums` around the midpoint `mid`, subtracting the value of `a[mid]` from each corresponding element.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`
    #- `subarray_sums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
    #- `missing_sum` is an integer representing the missing subarray sum
    #- `a` is a list of `n` zeros, with `a[mid]` being `missing_sum // (mid + 1)`
    #- `mid` is `n // 2`
    #
    #### Iterations and Their Effects
    ##### After 1 Iteration
    #- `i` is 1
    #- `a[0]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-1]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- All other elements in `a` are 0
    #
    ##### After 2 Iterations
    #- `i` is 2
    #- `a[1]` is `subarray_sums[1] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-2]` is `subarray_sums[1] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[0]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-1]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- All other elements in `a` are 0
    #
    ##### After 3 Iterations
    #- `i` is 3
    #- `a[2]` is `subarray_sums[2] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-3]` is `subarray_sums[2] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[1]` is `subarray_sums[1] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-2]` is `subarray_sums[1] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[0]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-1]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- All other elements in `a` are 0
    #
    #### General Pattern
    #After `k` iterations, where `k` is the number of iterations:
    #- `a[i]` for `0 <= i < k` is `subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-1-i]` for `0 <= i < k` is `subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]`
    #- All other elements in `a` are 0
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #When the loop finishes, `i` will be `mid - 1`. At this point, all elements in `a` that were updated by the loop will be filled according to the pattern described above. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, the loop will execute `mid` times, covering all elements up to `mid - 1`.
    #
    #### Final Values
    #- `i` will be `mid - 1`
    #- `mid` must be greater than or equal to `1` (since `n` is at least 3)
    #- `n` remains the same
    #- `subarray_sums` remains the same
    #- `missing_sum` remains the same
    #- `a` will have the values described above for all `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, and the rest will be zero
    #
    #### Output State
    #**Output State:**
    #- `i` is `mid - 1`
    #- `mid` is at least 1
    #- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`
    #- `subarray_sums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
    #- `missing_sum` is an integer representing the missing subarray sum
    #- `a` is a list of `n` elements where:
    #  - `a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]` for `0 <= i < mid`
    #  - All other elements in `a` are 0
    return a
    #`a` is a list of `n` elements where: a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]` for `0 <= i < mid`, and all other elements in `a` are 0, `i` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is at least 1, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`, `subarray_sums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `missing_sum` is an integer representing the missing subarray sum

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the missing subarray sum and then constructing a palindrome based on the given subarray sums. However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Missing Sum**: The function `func_1` calculates the expected sum of all subarray sums using the formula \( \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\right)^2 \). This formula assumes that the values in the array are from 1 to \( n \), which is not necessarily true. The values in the array can be any positive integers, and the sum of subarray sums should reflect these values accurately.

2. **Construction of Palindrome**: The function `func_2` constructs the palindrome array based on the missing sum and the sorted subarray sums. However, it does not account for the fact that the values in the subarray sums might not be uniformly distributed or aligned with the assumed sequence of integers from 1 to \( n \). This could lead to incorrect values being assigned to the array elements.

3. **Input Handling**: The function `func_3` reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases. However, it does not handle cases where the subarray sums might include very large values, which could cause overflow or incorrect handling.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- **Test Case**: 
  - \( n = 4 \)
  - Subarray sums: \( 18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9 \)

In this case, the expected subarray sums would include the sum of the entire array, which is not present in the given list. The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of all subarray sums and then find the missing sum. However, the provided code does not correctly handle this scenario.

For example, the missing sum calculation in the provided code might not accurately reflect the values in the array, leading to an incorrect construction of the palindrome array.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
