Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the missing subarray sum and then constructing a palindrome based on the given subarray sums. However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Missing Sum**: The function `func_1` calculates the expected sum of all subarray sums using the formula \( \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\right)^2 \). This formula assumes that the values in the array are from 1 to \( n \), which is not necessarily true. The values in the array can be any positive integers, and the sum of subarray sums should reflect these values accurately.

2. **Construction of Palindrome**: The function `func_2` constructs the palindrome array based on the missing sum and the sorted subarray sums. However, it does not account for the fact that the values in the subarray sums might not be uniformly distributed or aligned with the assumed sequence of integers from 1 to \( n \). This could lead to incorrect values being assigned to the array elements.

3. **Input Handling**: The function `func_3` reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases. However, it does not handle cases where the subarray sums might include very large values, which could cause overflow or incorrect handling.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- **Test Case**: 
  - \( n = 4 \)
  - Subarray sums: \( 18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9 \)

In this case, the expected subarray sums would include the sum of the entire array, which is not present in the given list. The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of all subarray sums and then find the missing sum. However, the provided code does not correctly handle this scenario.

For example, the missing sum calculation in the provided code might not accurately reflect the values in the array, leading to an incorrect construction of the palindrome array.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
