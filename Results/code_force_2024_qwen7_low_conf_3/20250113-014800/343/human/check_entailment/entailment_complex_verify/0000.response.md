### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment in detail.

#### Correctness of the Missing Sum Calculation

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the expected sum of all subarray sums using the formula \( \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\right)^2 \).
   - This formula is incorrect because it assumes the values in the array are from 1 to \( n \). The values in the array can be any positive integers, and the sum of subarray sums should reflect these values accurately.
   - The correct way to calculate the expected sum of all subarray sums is to consider the sum of all subarrays directly. For a palindrome array, the expected sum can be derived from the properties of palindromic sequences.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function constructs the palindrome array based on the missing sum and the sorted subarray sums.
   - The logic of setting `a[mid] = missing_sum // (mid + 1)` is flawed because it does not account for the specific values in the subarray sums. Instead, it should derive the values based on the properties of the subarray sums and the palindrome structure.
   - The assignment `a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]` and mirroring these values might not yield the correct palindrome values.

#### Construction of Palindrome Array

- The approach taken in `func_2` does not guarantee that the resulting array is a palindrome. The values in the subarray sums do not necessarily align with the assumed sequence of integers from 1 to \( n \).
- The logic in `func_2` does not properly handle the construction of the palindrome array based on the given subarray sums and the missing sum.

#### Input Handling

- The function `func_3` handles multiple test cases and reads input from stdin.
- The code does not explicitly handle very large values, which could cause overflow or incorrect handling, although this is not the primary issue here.

#### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's consider the example test case from the problem statement:

- **Test Case:**
  - \( n = 4 \)
  - Subarray sums: \( 18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9 \)

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the missing sum by comparing the expected sum of all subarray sums to the sum of the given subarray sums.
2. Constructing the palindrome array based on the properties of the subarray sums and ensuring the array is a palindrome.

Given the flaws in the current implementation, the provided code does not meet the problem requirements for all cases.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the missing sum and does not construct the palindrome array accurately.

**Final: False**
