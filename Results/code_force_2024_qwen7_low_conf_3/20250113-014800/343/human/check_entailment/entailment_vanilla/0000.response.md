Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find a palindromic array `a` of size `n` given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays. We need to ensure that the recovered array `a` is a palindrome.
2. **Expected Subarray Sums Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the expected sum of all subarray sums if the array was fully known. It computes the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` and squares it since each element will appear in half of the subarrays.
3. **Missing Sum Identification**: The function `func_1` correctly identifies the missing sum by subtracting the actual sum of the given subarray sums from the expected sum.
4. **Reconstructing the Palindrome Array**: The function `func_2` reconstructs the array `a` using the missing sum. It places the missing sum divided by `(mid + 1)` at the center of the array. Then, it fills the left and right halves symmetrically using the differences between the sorted subarray sums and the central value.
5. **Reading Input and Processing**: The function `func_3` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the resulting palindromic array.

Let's verify each part:

- **func_1**: The logic to calculate the expected sum and identify the missing sum is correct. Given that the input constraints guarantee there is always at least one valid solution, `func_1` should work as expected.
- **func_2**: The logic to construct the palindrome array seems sound. It places the central value correctly and uses the differences to fill the left and right halves symmetrically. This ensures the array remains a palindrome.
- **func_3**: The function reads input correctly and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and `func_2` appropriately. It prints the results in the required format.

Given the logical correctness of each function and the overall approach, the program appears to be designed to solve the problem correctly under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
