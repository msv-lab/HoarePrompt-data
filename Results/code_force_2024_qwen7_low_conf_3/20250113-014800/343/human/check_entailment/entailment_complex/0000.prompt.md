You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

# Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, and subarray_sums is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array a of size n.
def func_1(n, subarray_sums):
    total_subarrays = n * (n + 1) // 2
    expected_sum = sum(range(1, n + 1)) ** 2
    actual_sum = sum(subarray_sums)
    missing_sum = expected_sum - actual_sum
    return missing_sum
    #The program returns missing_sum which is expected_sum - actual_sum, where expected_sum is ((n * (n + 1)) // 2) and actual_sum is the sum of all subarray_sums in subarray_sums
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `subarray_sums`. It calculates the expected sum of all subarray sums of a palindrome array of size `n` and then subtracts the actual sum of the provided subarray sums from this expected sum to find the missing subarray sum. The function returns the missing subarray sum. This calculation assumes that `subarray_sums` contains all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array of size `n`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Computes the total number of subarrays for a palindrome array of size `n` using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
2. Calculates the expected sum of these subarrays using the formula `((n * (n + 1)) // 2)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, subarray_sums is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and missing_sum is an integer representing the missing subarray sum.
def func_2(n, subarray_sums, missing_sum):
    subarray_sums.sort()
    a = [0] * n
    mid = n // 2
    a[mid] = missing_sum // (mid + 1)
    for i in range(mid):
        a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]
        
        a[n - 1 - i] = a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop and the given output states step by step to determine the final output state after the loop has executed.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis
    #The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `mid - 1` (inclusive). For each iteration, the loop updates the list `a` as follows:
    #- `a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n - 1 - i] = a[i]`
    #
    #This means the loop essentially mirrors the values of `subarray_sums` around the midpoint `mid`, subtracting the value of `a[mid]` from each corresponding element.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`
    #- `subarray_sums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
    #- `missing_sum` is an integer representing the missing subarray sum
    #- `a` is a list of `n` zeros, with `a[mid]` being `missing_sum // (mid + 1)`
    #- `mid` is `n // 2`
    #
    #### Iterations and Their Effects
    ##### After 1 Iteration
    #- `i` is 1
    #- `a[0]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-1]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- All other elements in `a` are 0
    #
    ##### After 2 Iterations
    #- `i` is 2
    #- `a[1]` is `subarray_sums[1] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-2]` is `subarray_sums[1] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[0]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-1]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- All other elements in `a` are 0
    #
    ##### After 3 Iterations
    #- `i` is 3
    #- `a[2]` is `subarray_sums[2] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-3]` is `subarray_sums[2] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[1]` is `subarray_sums[1] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-2]` is `subarray_sums[1] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[0]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-1]` is `subarray_sums[0] - a[mid]`
    #- All other elements in `a` are 0
    #
    #### General Pattern
    #After `k` iterations, where `k` is the number of iterations:
    #- `a[i]` for `0 <= i < k` is `subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]`
    #- `a[n-1-i]` for `0 <= i < k` is `subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]`
    #- All other elements in `a` are 0
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #When the loop finishes, `i` will be `mid - 1`. At this point, all elements in `a` that were updated by the loop will be filled according to the pattern described above. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, the loop will execute `mid` times, covering all elements up to `mid - 1`.
    #
    #### Final Values
    #- `i` will be `mid - 1`
    #- `mid` must be greater than or equal to `1` (since `n` is at least 3)
    #- `n` remains the same
    #- `subarray_sums` remains the same
    #- `missing_sum` remains the same
    #- `a` will have the values described above for all `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, and the rest will be zero
    #
    #### Output State
    #**Output State:**
    #- `i` is `mid - 1`
    #- `mid` is at least 1
    #- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`
    #- `subarray_sums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
    #- `missing_sum` is an integer representing the missing subarray sum
    #- `a` is a list of `n` elements where:
    #  - `a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]` for `0 <= i < mid`
    #  - All other elements in `a` are 0
    return a
    #`a` is a list of `n` elements where: a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]` for `0 <= i < mid`, and all other elements in `a` are 0, `i` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is at least 1, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`, `subarray_sums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `missing_sum` is an integer representing the missing subarray sum
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`), `subarray_sums` (a list of integers sorted in ascending order), and `missing_sum` (an integer representing the missing subarray sum). The function first sorts `subarray_sums`. Then, it initializes a list `a` of length `n` with all elements set to zero. The function calculates the midpoint `mid` of the list `a` and sets `a[mid]` to `missing_sum // (mid + 1)`. Next, it iterates through the first half of the list `a`, setting each element `a[i]` to `subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]` and mirroring these values to the corresponding positions in the second half of the list. After completing the loop, the function returns the list `a`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` is less than 3, the function should raise an error since the precondition requires `3 <= n <= 1000`.
- If `subarray_sums` is not sorted in ascending order, the function assumes it is already sorted and does not check this condition. Therefore, if `subarray_sums` is not sorted, the behavior of the function might be undefined.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is:
- `a` is a list of `n` elements where for `0 <= i < mid`, `a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]`, and all other elements in `a` are 0.
- `i` is `mid - 1`.
- `mid` is at least 1.
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`.
- `subarray_sums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `missing_sum` is an integer representing the missing subarray sum.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 200; n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000; subarray_sums is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a of size n; missing_sum is an integer representing the missing subarray sum; and palindrome is a list of n positive integers forming a palindrome array.
def func_3():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        subarray_sums = list(map(int, data[index:index + n * (n + 1) // 2 - 1]))
        
        index += n * (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        
        missing_sum = func_1(n, subarray_sums)
        
        palindrome = func_2(n, subarray_sums, missing_sum)
        
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, palindrome)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `index` is `t * n * (n + 1) // 2 - t`, `subarray_sums` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n * (n + 1) // 2 - 1]`, `missing_sum` is the return value of `func_1(n, subarray_sums)`, `palindrome` is the return value of `func_2(n, subarray_sums, missing_sum)`, and `results` is a list containing the string representation of `palindrome` repeated `t` times.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `results` is a list containing the string representation of `palindrome` repeated `t` times, each element in `results` is printed in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes it to find missing subarray sums and reconstructs a palindrome array, and then prints the reconstructed arrays. Specifically, the function performs the following steps:
1. Reads `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, the size of the palindrome array.
3. It then reads a list of `subarray_sums`, which contains all subarray sums except one.
4. It calls `func_1` to find the missing subarray sum.
5. It calls `func_2` to reconstruct the palindrome array using the `subarray_sums` and the missing sum.
6. It stores the reconstructed palindrome array as a string in the `results` list.
7. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the `results` list, which contains the reconstructed palindrome arrays for each test case.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input `t` is 0, the function will not process any test cases.
- If the input `n` is less than 3 or greater than 1000, the function will raise an error because `n` is constrained within this range.
- If the length of `subarray_sums` does not match the expected length based on `n`, the function will handle it according to the constraints given in the problem statement.
- If `func_1` or `func_2` fails to find the missing sum or reconstruct the palindrome array, the function will handle these errors based on their implementations.
