Reasoning:  
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that all functions work as intended and collectively meet the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly calculates the missing subarray sum by comparing the expected sum of all subarray sums (calculated as the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers) with the actual sum of the provided subarray sums.
   - The calculation logic is sound and meets the problem's requirement to find the missing subarray sum.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly reconstructs a palindrome array using the provided subarray sums and the missing sum.
   - It initializes the array, calculates the middle element, and uses a loop to fill the first half of the array while mirroring the values to the second half to ensure the array is a palindrome.
   - The function handles the creation of the palindrome array correctly, ensuring the resulting array is a palindrome.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - The function reads input from standard input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` to find the missing subarray sum and `func_2` to reconstruct the palindrome array.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the output format matches the required format (a space-separated list of integers).
   - The function reads input efficiently and processes it as per the problem statement.

Given that each function performs its intended task correctly and collectively they fulfill the problem requirements, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
