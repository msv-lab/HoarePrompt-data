You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, subarray_sums):
    total_subarrays = n * (n + 1) // 2
    expected_sum = sum(range(1, n + 1)) ** 2
    actual_sum = sum(subarray_sums)
    missing_sum = expected_sum - actual_sum
    return missing_sum

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, subarray_sums, missing_sum):
    subarray_sums.sort()
    a = [0] * n
    mid = n // 2
    a[mid] = missing_sum // (mid + 1)
    for i in range(mid):
        a[i] = subarray_sums[i] - a[mid]
        a[n - 1 - i] = a[i]
    return a

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        subarray_sums = list(map(int, data[index:index + n * (n + 1) // 2 - 1]))
        index += n * (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        missing_sum = func_1(n, subarray_sums)
        palindrome = func_2(n, subarray_sums, missing_sum)
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, palindrome)))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function reads input from standard input, processes it to find missing subarray sums and reconstructs a palindrome array, and then prints the reconstructed arrays. Specifically, the function performs the following steps:
1. Reads `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, the size of the palindrome array.
3. It then reads a list of `subarray_sums`, which contains all subarray sums except one.
4. It calls `func_1` to find the missing subarray sum.
5. It calls `func_2` to reconstruct the palindrome array using the `subarray_sums` and the missing sum.
6. It stores the reconstructed palindrome array as a string in the `results` list.
7. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the `results` list, which contains the reconstructed palindrome arrays for each test case.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input `t` is 0, the function will not process any test cases.
- If the input `n` is less than 3 or greater than 1000, the function will raise an error because `n` is constrained within this range.
- If the length of `subarray_sums` does not match the expected length based on `n`, the function will handle it according to the constraints given in the problem statement.
- If `func_1` or `func_2` fails to find the missing sum or reconstruct the palindrome array, the function will handle these errors based on their implementations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find a palindromic array `a` of size `n` given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays. We need to ensure that the recovered array `a` is a palindrome.
2. **Expected Subarray Sums Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the expected sum of all subarray sums if the array was fully known. It computes the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` and squares it since each element will appear in half of the subarrays.
3. **Missing Sum Identification**: The function `func_1` correctly identifies the missing sum by subtracting the actual sum of the given subarray sums from the expected sum.
4. **Reconstructing the Palindrome Array**: The function `func_2` reconstructs the array `a` using the missing sum. It places the missing sum divided by `(mid + 1)` at the center of the array. Then, it fills the left and right halves symmetrically using the differences between the sorted subarray sums and the central value.
5. **Reading Input and Processing**: The function `func_3` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the resulting palindromic array.

Let's verify each part:

- **func_1**: The logic to calculate the expected sum and identify the missing sum is correct. Given that the input constraints guarantee there is always at least one valid solution, `func_1` should work as expected.
- **func_2**: The logic to construct the palindrome array seems sound. It places the central value correctly and uses the differences to fill the left and right halves symmetrically. This ensures the array remains a palindrome.
- **func_3**: The function reads input correctly and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and `func_2` appropriately. It prints the results in the required format.

Given the logical correctness of each function and the overall approach, the program appears to be designed to solve the problem correctly under the given constraints.
