### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding a palindromic array \(a\) of size \(n\) given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays. The recovered array must be a palindrome.

2. **Expected Subarray Sums Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the expected sum of all subarray sums if the array was fully known. It computes the sum of all numbers from 1 to \(n\) and squares it, since each element will appear in half of the subarrays. This step is accurate.

3. **Missing Sum Identification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the missing sum by subtracting the actual sum of the given subarray sums from the expected sum. This step is also accurate.

4. **Reconstructing the Palindrome Array**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to reconstruct the array `a` using the missing sum. However, the approach used in `func_2` is flawed. It places the missing sum divided by \((\text{mid} + 1)\) at the center of the array, assuming that this central value can be used to reconstruct the entire array symmetrically. This is not necessarily true, as the missing subarray could be a segment of the array that affects the symmetry differently.

   - The function then fills the left and right halves symmetrically using the differences between the sorted subarray sums and the central value. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will be a palindrome. For instance, consider the case where the missing subarray sum is significantly different from the average of the subarray sums, leading to an asymmetrical reconstruction.

5. **Reading Input and Processing**:
   - The function `func_3` reads the input correctly and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and `func_2` appropriately. However, the flaw in `func_2` means that the final output may not always be a valid palindrome array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the reconstruction method in `func_2` will always produce a valid palindrome array. The provided function does not guarantee the correct reconstruction of the array, especially when the missing subarray sum is significant or when the subarray sums do not provide enough information to uniquely determine the array.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct under all circumstances.

**Final: False**
