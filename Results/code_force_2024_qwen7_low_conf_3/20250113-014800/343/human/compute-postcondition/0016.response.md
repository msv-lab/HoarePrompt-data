Postcondition: ***`odds` must have at least one element remaining, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` elements. If `idx` equals \(n - 1 - idx\), then the value of `a[(n - 3) // 2]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a[(n - 3) // 2]` and `a[2 - (n // 2)]` are both updated to \((x - prev) // 2\), and `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, with `idx` being \((n - 3) // 2\).***
