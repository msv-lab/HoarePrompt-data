According to the code, the loop condition is `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`. For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions must be true:

1. `len(smallList) > 0`: This ensures that `smallList` is not empty.
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: This ensures that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

Right before the loop, `bigList` is a list of integers representing the full list of subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing the provided subarray sums of `a`, with one missing sum.

- The condition `len(smallList) > 0` is already satisfied since `smallList` cannot be empty (as stated in the problem).
- The condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` must hold true for the loop to execute.

To ensure that the loop can proceed, `bigList[-1]` must be equal to `smallList[-1]`.

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers representing the full list of subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing the provided subarray sums of `a`, with one missing sum, and `bigList[-1]` must be equal to `smallList[-1]`**
