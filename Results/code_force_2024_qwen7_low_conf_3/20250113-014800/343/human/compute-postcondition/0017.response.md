The code `prev = x` assigns the value of `x` to the variable `prev`. This does not change the value of `x` itself but stores its current value in `prev`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odds` must have at least one element remaining, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` elements, `idx` equals \(n - 1 - idx\), `a[(n - 3) // 2]` remains unchanged, `a[2 - (n // 2)]` remains unchanged if `idx` does not equal \((n - 3) // 2\), otherwise it remains unchanged, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`, and `x` remains unchanged.**
