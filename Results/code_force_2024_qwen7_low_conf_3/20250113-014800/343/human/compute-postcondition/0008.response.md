`smallList.pop()` removes the last element of `smallList`. The last element of `smallList` was already removed, so removing it again does not change the state of `smallList`. However, since the last element of `smallList` is now one element shorter, the precondition that the last element of `bigList` is not equal to the last element of `smallList` remains valid.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is not equal to the last element of `smallList`**
