`a[idx]` is assigned the value of `(x - prev) // 2`. Given that `idx` is \((n - 3) // 2\), and considering the initial state where `odds` must have at least one element remaining, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` elements, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, and `idx` is \((n - 3) // 2\), the value of `a[idx]` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`odds` must have at least one element remaining, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` elements where `a[(n - 3) // 2]` is updated to \((x - prev) // 2\), `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, and `idx` is \((n - 3) // 2\)**
