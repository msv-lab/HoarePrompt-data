Postcondition: ***`odds` must have at least one element remaining, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` elements, `idx` equals \(n - 2 - \text{idx}\), `a[(n - 3) // 2]` remains unchanged, `a[2 - (n // 2)]` remains unchanged if `idx` does not equal \((n - 3) // 2\), otherwise it remains unchanged, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`, and `x` is reassigned to the next element in `odds`. Depending on the condition, `a[idx]` is either set to `x` or `a[\frac{n}{2}]` is assigned the value \((x - prev) // 2\).***
