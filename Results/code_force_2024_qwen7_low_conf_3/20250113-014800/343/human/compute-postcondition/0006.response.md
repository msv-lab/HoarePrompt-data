Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed.
   - `smallList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed.
   - The last element of `bigList` is not equal to the last element of `smallList`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must be met:
     1. `len(smallList) > 0`
     2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

4. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Since we are not explicitly told the values of `bigList` and `smallList` but their general properties, we know that:
     - `bigList` has had its last two elements removed.
     - `smallList` has had its last two elements removed.
     - The last element of `bigList` is not equal to the last element of `smallList`.

5. **Determine Adjustments**:
   - **Condition 1 (`len(smallList) > 0`)**: This condition is already satisfied since `smallList` still has elements (otherwise, the loop would have terminated).
   - **Condition 2 (`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`)**: For the loop to continue, the last elements of both lists must be equal. Given the problem's description, this condition is not met in the current state.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To make the loop execute one more time, the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` need to be equal. 

7. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`**
