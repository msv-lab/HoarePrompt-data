`cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the updated `sm` and now includes `sm` itself. `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` plus `a[len(a) - 2]`. `i` is `len(a) - 3`; `j` is `len(a) - 2`. The code appends `sm` to the list `cts`.

Since `cts` already contains all cumulative sums up to the second last element of `a` (as per the initial state), appending `sm` to `cts` will add the sum of all elements of `a` to `cts`. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements; `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the sum of all elements of `a`; `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` plus `a[len(a) - 2]`; `i` is `len(a) - 3`; `j` is `len(a) - 2`. `cts` is updated with `sm`.**
