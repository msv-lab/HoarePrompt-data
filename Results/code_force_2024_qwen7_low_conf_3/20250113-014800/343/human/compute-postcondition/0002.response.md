`smallList` is a list of integers representing the provided subarray sums of `a` with one missing sum. The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed**
