Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of `a`, `sm` is the cumulative sum of the subarray starting from the first element to the last element, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(a) - 1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `cts` is initially an empty list.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For each `i`, the inner loop starts from `i` and sums up the elements from `a[i]` to `a[len(a) - 1]`.
   - The cumulative sum `sm` is appended to the list `cts` after each inner loop completes.
3. **Final Iteration**:
   - When the outer loop completes its last iteration (i.e., when `i` is `len(a) - 1`), `sm` will contain the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - The loop will have executed `len(a)` times in total, resulting in `cts` containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index to the end of `a`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `cts` will contain the cumulative sums of all subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of `a`, and `sm` will be the sum of all elements in `a`.

### Special Case:
- If `a` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `cts` will remain an empty list.
