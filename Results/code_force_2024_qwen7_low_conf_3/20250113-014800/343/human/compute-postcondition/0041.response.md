Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers, which represents the subarray sums of a palindrome array. It calculates the cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index to the end of `a`. These cumulative sums are stored in the list `cts`. After sorting `cts`, the function returns the sorted list of these cumulative sums. The function handles the case where `a` is a non-empty list of integers. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that `a` is not empty and its length satisfies \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) < \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), where \(n\) is the length of the original palindrome array.**

This summary focuses on the actual operations performed by the code, without delving into implementation details, and covers the potential edge case of an empty list (though the code implicitly assumes the list is not empty).
