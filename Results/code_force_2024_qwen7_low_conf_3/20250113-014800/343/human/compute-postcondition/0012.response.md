Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are lists of integers. It aims to remove the last `len(smallList)` elements from `bigList` and `smallList`, ensuring the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal. After performing these operations, the function returns the last element of `bigList` before the removal. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If `bigList` or `smallList` is empty, the function will not execute the loop and will return `bigList[-1]`, which could be an error depending on the expected behavior.
- If `len(smallList) == len(bigList)`, the loop will run until both lists are empty, and the function will return `None`.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where `len(smallList)` is greater than `len(bigList)`. In such cases, the loop will raise an `IndexError` because `bigList.pop()` would be called more times than available elements.**

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `bigList` has had its last `len(smallList)` elements removed, and `smallList` has had its last `len(smallList)` elements removed as well. The function returns the last element of `bigList` before the removal.**
