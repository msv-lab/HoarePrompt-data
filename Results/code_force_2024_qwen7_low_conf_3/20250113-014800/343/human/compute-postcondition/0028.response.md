The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of the palindrome array `a`, excluding one of the sums, and `n`, which is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000` and represents the length of the array `a`. After executing the function body, it returns a list `a` which contains `n` elements where each element is either 0 or the corresponding value from `odds`, and `idx` is -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n`, and return a list `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or a corresponding value from `odds`, along with `idx` being -1.
