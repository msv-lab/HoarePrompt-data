The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from the `smallList`. This action affects only the `smallList`. The `bigList` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state where `smallList` had its last element removed before this code, removing the last element again does not change the fact that the last element of `bigList` was equal to the last element of `smallList` before the operation. After the operation, this equality no longer holds because the last element of `smallList` has been removed.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is not equal to the last element of `smallList`**
