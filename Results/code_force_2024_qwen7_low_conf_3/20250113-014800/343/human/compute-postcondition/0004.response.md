`bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since `bigList` originally had its last element removed, removing another element means `bigList` now has two elements fewer than it started with compared to `smallList`. However, the last element of `bigList` was equal to the last element of `smallList`, and this condition still holds after the pop operation because we only removed one more element from `bigList`. The last element of `smallList` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`**
