`idx` is decremented by 1. The value of `idx` was originally \(n - 1 - \text{idx}\). After decrementing, `idx` is now \(n - 2 - \text{idx}\). All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`odds` must have at least one element remaining, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` elements, `idx` equals \(n - 2 - \text{idx}\), `a[(n - 3) // 2]` remains unchanged, `a[2 - (n // 2)]` remains unchanged if `idx` does not equal \((n - 3) // 2\), otherwise it remains unchanged, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`, and `x` remains unchanged.**
