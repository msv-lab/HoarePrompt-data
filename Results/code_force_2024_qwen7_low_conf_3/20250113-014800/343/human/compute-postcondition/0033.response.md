Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements.
- `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the updated `sm` and now includes `sm` itself.
- `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `j` is `len(a) - 1`.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(i, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts with `j = i` and increments `j` until `j` reaches `len(a)`.
- Initially, `i = len(a) - 2` and `j = len(a) - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 1`.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - The loop will start with `j = len(a) - 1`.
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented to `len(a)`, which means the loop will exit.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - To continue the loop, `j` must remain within the range defined by the `range(i, len(a))`.
   - Since `i` is fixed as `len(a) - 2` and `j` was incremented to `len(a)` in the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to allow `j` to still be within the range.

4. **Adjusting `i`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be decremented by 1 to allow `j` to increment to `len(a) - 1` in the next iteration.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be decremented to `len(a) - 3`.
- `j` will start from `i + 1` (which is `len(a) - 2`) and will increment to `len(a) - 1` in the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `a` remains a non-empty list with at least 3 elements.
- `cts` remains a list of cumulative sums.
- `sm` remains the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `i` is now `len(a) - 3`.
- `j` will start from `len(a) - 2` and increment to `len(a) - 1` in the next iteration.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements; `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the updated `sm` and now includes `sm` itself; `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is `len(a) - 3`; `j` is `len(a) - 2`**.
