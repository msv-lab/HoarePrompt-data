The code updates the value of `sm` by adding the element `a[j]` to `sm`. From the initial state, `j` is `len(a) - 2`. Therefore, the new value of `sm` will be the previous value of `sm` plus `a[len(a) - 2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the updated `sm` and now includes `sm` itself, `i` is `len(a) - 3`, and `j` is `len(a) - 2`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements; `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the updated `sm` and now includes `sm` itself; `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` plus `a[len(a) - 2]; `i` is `len(a) - 3`; `j` is `len(a) - 2`**
