Output State: **`odds` must have at least one element remaining, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` elements, `idx` equals \(n - 2 - \text{idx}\), `a[(n - 3) // 2]` remains unchanged, `a[2 - (n // 2)]` remains unchanged if `idx` does not equal \((n - 3) // 2\), otherwise it remains unchanged, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`, `x` is reassigned to the next element in `odds`, and `a[idx]` is assigned the value \((x - \text{prev}) // 2\).**
