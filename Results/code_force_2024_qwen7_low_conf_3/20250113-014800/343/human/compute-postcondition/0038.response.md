`cts` is a list of cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of `a`. After sorting `cts`, the order of elements in `cts` changes, but the values of the elements themselves remain the same. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cts` is a sorted list of cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index to the end of `a`, `sm` is the cumulative sum of the subarray starting from the first element to the last element, `i` is 0, `j` is len(`a`) - 1**
