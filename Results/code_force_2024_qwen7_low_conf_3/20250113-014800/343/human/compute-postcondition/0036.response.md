Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information and the loop code.

### Initial State
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index.
- `sm` is 0.
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `j` is `len(a) - 2`.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(i, len(a)):
    sm = sm + a[j]
    cts.append(sm)
```

### Analysis
1. **First Iteration (j = len(a) - 2):**
   - `sm` becomes `sm + a[len(a) - 2]`.
   - `cts` is updated with this new value of `sm`.
   - `i` remains `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` is incremented to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Second Iteration (j = len(a) - 1):**
   - `sm` becomes `sm + a[len(a) - 1]`.
   - `cts` is updated with this new value of `sm`.
   - `i` remains `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` increments to `len(a)` (loop exits here).

3. **After Both Iterations:**
   - `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `cts` contains the cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the sum of all elements.
   - `i` is decremented to `len(a) - 3`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 2`.

4. **General Case After Multiple Iterations:**
   - The loop continues until `j` reaches the end of the list.
   - `sm` accumulates the sum of all elements from the starting index to the current index.
   - `cts` is updated with each new cumulative sum.
   - `i` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

5. **Final State:**
   - The loop will stop when `j` equals `len(a)`, meaning it has iterated through all elements of `a` from `i` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - `sm` will be the sum of all elements in `a` from the starting index to the last index.
   - `cts` will contain all cumulative sums from the first element to the last element of `a`.
   - `i` will be decremented to the point where the loop stops, which is `len(a) - 1 - (number of iterations)`.
   - `j` will be `len(a) - 1`.

### Conclusion
After the loop has finished executing all iterations, the following conditions will hold:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the sum of all elements.
- `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `i` will be the starting index minus the number of iterations, which is `len(a) - 1`.
- `j` will be `len(a) - 1`.

### Output State
**Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index, including the sum of all elements, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 1 - (number of iterations)`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`.**
