`idx` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was \(n - 2 - \text{idx}\), so the new value of `idx` is \(n - 3 - \text{idx}\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odds` must have at least one element remaining, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` elements, `idx` equals \(n - 3 - \text{idx}\), `a[(n - 3) // 2]` remains unchanged, `a[2 - (n // 2)]` remains unchanged if `idx` does not equal \((n - 3) // 2\), otherwise it remains unchanged, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `x`, and `x` is reassigned to the next element in `odds`.**
