Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements.
   - `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index including the updated `sm`.
   - `sm` is updated to `sm + a[len(a) - 2]`.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 1`.

2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```python
   sm = sm + a[j]
   ```

3. We need to analyze the impact of this code on the variables:
   - `sm` is already updated to include `a[len(a) - 2]`.
   - Now, the code adds `a[j]` to `sm`. Since `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `a[j]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.
   - Therefore, `sm` now includes the sum of all elements in the list `a` (from the first element to the last element).

4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the code:
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `cts` remains the same because no operation involving `cts` is performed.
   - `i` remains `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` remains `len(a) - 1`.

Based on these points, the output state will be:
- `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements.
- `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index including the updated `sm`.
- `sm` is now the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `j` is `len(a) - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements; `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index including the updated `sm`; `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is `len(a) - 2`; `j` is `len(a) - 1`.**
