The code `cts.append(sm)` appends the sum of all elements in the list `a` (which is stored in `sm`) to the list `cts`. The length and content of the list `a` remain unchanged, and the variable `i` remains `len(a) - 2` while `j` remains `len(a) - 1`.

After executing the code, the list `cts` will have one additional element, which is the sum of all elements in `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements; `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index including the updated `sm` and now includes `sm` itself; `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is `len(a) - 2`; `j` is `len(a) - 1`.**
