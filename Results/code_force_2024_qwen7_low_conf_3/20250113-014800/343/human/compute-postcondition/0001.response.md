`bigList.pop()` removes the last element from the `bigList`. The initial state is that `bigList` is a list of integers representing the full list of subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing the provided subarray sums of `a`, with one missing sum, and `bigList[-1]` must be equal to `smallList[-1]`.

After executing the code, the last element of `bigList` is removed, but the relationship between `bigList` and `smallList` remains unchanged except for the last elements. Therefore, the new condition is that `bigList[-1]` does not necessarily equal `smallList[-1]` anymore because the last element has been removed.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers representing the provided subarray sums of `a` with one missing sum, and `bigList[-1]` is not necessarily equal to `smallList[-1]`.**
