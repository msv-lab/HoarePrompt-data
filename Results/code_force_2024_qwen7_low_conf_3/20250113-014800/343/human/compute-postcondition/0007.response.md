`bigList` had its last element removed by the `pop()` method. Since the last element of `bigList` was equal to the last element of `smallList`, after removing the last element, the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`. The `smallList` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is not equal to the last element of `smallList`**
