Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements.
   - `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index including the updated `sm`.
   - `sm` is updated as `sm + a[len(a) - 2]`.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i` to `len(a)`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 2`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Since `i` is fixed at `len(a) - 2`, the loop will continue if `j` increments to `len(a) - 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged at `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` will be incremented to `len(a) - 1`.

6. **Final States:**
   - `a` remains the same (non-empty list with at least 3 elements).
   - `cts` will include the cumulative sum up to the new `j` value.
   - `sm` remains unchanged for now, but it will be updated during the loop body if needed.
   - `i` remains `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` becomes `len(a) - 1`.

So, the final state before the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums starting from the first element of `a` up to each index including the updated `sm`, `sm` is `sm + a[len(a) - 2]`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`**
