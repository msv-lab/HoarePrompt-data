The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n` such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\). It constructs a list `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or a corresponding value from `odds`. This construction is achieved through a loop that iterates over `odds`, setting values in `a` based on the index `idx`, which is initialized to half of `n - 1` and decremented in each iteration. If the current index `idx` equals its mirror index in the array (i.e., `n - 1 - idx`), then the value of `x` is directly assigned to `a[idx]`. Otherwise, the value `(x - prev) // 2` is assigned to both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]`. The variable `prev` is updated to the current value of `x` in each iteration. After the loop, `idx` is set to -1, indicating the end of the process. The function returns the constructed list `a` and the value of `idx` as -1.
