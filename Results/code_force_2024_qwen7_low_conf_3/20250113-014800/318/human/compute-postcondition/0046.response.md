Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\)
   - `n` is at most 4
   - `mid` is `n // 2`
   - `a` is a list containing elements \([n - 1, \text{mid} + (n - 1), n, \text{mid} + n, \ldots, k, \text{mid} + k]\) where \( k \) ranges from \( n - 1 \) to \( 2 * n - 2 \) in steps of 2. If \( n \) is odd, the list `a` includes an additional element `n`
   - `i` is 0

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. This line of code prints the first element of the list `a` and does not affect any of the variables. The value of `i` remains 0.

4. Since `i` is 0, the first element of the list `a` is accessed, which is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output of the code is the value of `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\); `n` is at most 4; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is a list containing elements \([n - 1, \text{mid} + (n - 1), n, \text{mid} + n, \ldots, k, \text{mid} + k]\) where \( k \) ranges from \( n - 1 \) to \( 2 * n - 2 \) in steps of 2. If `n` is odd, the list `a` includes an additional element `n`; `i` is 0, and the output is `n - 1`.**
