The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Since no specific value for `i` or `a` is given in the initial state, we assume `a` is an existing list and `i` is a variable holding a value. After executing the code, the value of `i` is added to the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list with its last element being `i`, `i` is an integer or any other data type it was previously.**
