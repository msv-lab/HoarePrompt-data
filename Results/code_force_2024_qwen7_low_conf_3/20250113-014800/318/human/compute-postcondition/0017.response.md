Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n // 2` followed by integers from `mid + 2` to `(n // 2) + n // 2`. If `n` is odd, the last element of `a` is `n`. If `n` is even, the last element of `a` remains unchanged.***
