Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2
   - `mid` is `n // 2`
   - `a` is `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3, (n // 2) + 3]`
   - `i` is 3

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n // 2`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

5. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range of the loop, i.e., `1 <= i < n // 2 + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, it needs to be incremented to 4 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` should be incremented to 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`1 <= i < n // 2 + 1`) must still hold true.
   - Since `i` is now 4, it must be less than `n // 2 + 1` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than 4, meaning `n // 2` must be greater than 3.

7. **Final States:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than 8 (since `n // 2 > 3` implies `n > 6` and `n` is an integer, so the smallest possible value for `n` is 7, making `n // 2 = 3.5` which rounds up to 4).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3, (n // 2) + 3]`, `i` is 4**
