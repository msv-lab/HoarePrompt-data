Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\); `n` is at most 4; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is a list containing elements `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n, ..., k, mid + k]` where `k` ranges from `n - 1` to `2 * n - 2` in steps of 2; `i` is `2 * n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs as long as `i < n // 2 + 1`. Given the conditions, the maximum value of `n` is 4 because if `n` were greater than 4, the loop would run more than 2 times, which contradicts the provided output states.
- For `n = 3`, the loop runs twice, appending `[2, 2], [3, 3]` to `a`, resulting in `a = [2, 2, 3, 3]`.
- For `n = 4`, the loop runs twice, appending `[3, 3], [4, 4]` to `a`, resulting in `a = [3, 3, 4, 4]`.

Given this pattern, after the loop completes, `a` will contain pairs of the form `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1)], [n, mid + n], ...` up to `[2 * n - 2, mid + (2 * n - 2)]`.

Thus, the final state after the loop finishes executing is as described above.
