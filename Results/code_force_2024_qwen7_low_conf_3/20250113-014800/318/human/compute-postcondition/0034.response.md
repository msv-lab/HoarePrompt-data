The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Let's analyze the changes:

- Initially, `a` is defined as `[n - 1, n // 2 + (n - 1)]`.
- After appending `i` (which is `n`), `a` becomes `[n - 1, n // 2 + (n - 1), n]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\)
- `n` must be less than or equal to 4
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- `a` is now `[n - 1, n // 2 + (n - 1), n]`
- `i` is `n`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\); `n` must be less than or equal to 4; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is `[n - 1, n // 2 + (n - 1), n]`; `i` is `n`**
