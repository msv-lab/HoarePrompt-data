The code snippet `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the value of `a[i]` without a newline. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-2`, `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice, and the value of `a[i]` is printed.**
