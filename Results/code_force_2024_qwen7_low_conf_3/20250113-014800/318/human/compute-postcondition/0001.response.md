According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer and within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). The variable `_` is a placeholder used when the loop variable is not needed, so we don't need to adjust any specific variable named `_`.

Before the loop starts, the only state that needs to be ensured is that `t` is a positive integer within the given range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
