Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `a` is `[n, (n // 2) + n, n + 1, (n // 2) + n + 1]`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, which is greater than `n // 2 + 1` (the upper bound of the range), the loop condition `1 <= i < n // 2 + 1` is not satisfied.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again based on the current state.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop does not meet the condition to continue iterating, there is no need to adjust the states for another iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **No adjustment needed as the loop will not execute again.**

This means the states `n`, `mid`, `i`, and `a` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
