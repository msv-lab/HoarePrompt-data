The code snippet appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Let's break down the steps:

1. Initial values:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\)
   - `n` must be less than or equal to 4
   - `mid` is calculated as `n // 2`
   - `a` is initialized as `[n - 1, n // 2 + (n - 1), n]`
   - `i` is `n`

2. After calculating `mid`, `a` is `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n]`.

3. The code snippet appends `mid + i` to `a`. Since `i` is `n`, `mid + i` is `mid + n`.

4. So, the updated list `a` becomes `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\); `n` must be less than or equal to 4; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n]`; `i` is `n`.**
