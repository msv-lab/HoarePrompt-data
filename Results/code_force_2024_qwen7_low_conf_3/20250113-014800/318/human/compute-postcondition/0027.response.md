`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The values of `t`, `mid`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\), `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n // 2` followed by integers from `mid + 2` to `(n // 2) + n // 2`, and `i` is `n - 1`**
