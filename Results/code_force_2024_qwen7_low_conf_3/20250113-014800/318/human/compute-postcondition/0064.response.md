Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` and each element appears twice.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // 2 + 1`.
- For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 starting from `n` (since initially `i` is set to `n`).
- The list `a` gets appended with two elements: `i` and `mid + i`.
- After the loop completes, the list `a` will contain all integers from `n` to `n + mid - 1`, each appearing twice.

For example, if `n = 4`, then `mid = 2`, and the loop will append `a` as follows:
1. First iteration: `a` becomes `[4, 4]` (i = 1, so 1 + 4 = 5, but since `i` starts at `n` and increments by 1, the first element is 4).
2. Second iteration: `a` becomes `[4, 4, 5, 7]` (i = 2, so 2 + 2 = 4, 2 + 4 = 6).

After all iterations, `a` will be a list of length `2 * (n // 2 + 1)` containing the sequence from `n` to `n + mid - 1` repeated twice.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n < 2`), then:
- `n` is less than 2.
- `mid` remains `n // 2`, which is 0.
- `i` remains `n`.
- `a` remains an empty list `[]`.

Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
