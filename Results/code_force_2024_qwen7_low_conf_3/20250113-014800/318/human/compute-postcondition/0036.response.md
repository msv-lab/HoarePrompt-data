Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\).
   - `n` must be less than or equal to 4.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - `a` is `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n]`.
   - `i` is `n`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop Starts:**
   - `i` is `n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting Other States:**
   - Since the value of `i` changes but none of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mid`, and `a`) are modified by the loop, their values remain the same.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\).
   - `n` remains less than or equal to 4.
   - `mid` remains `n // 2`.
   - `a` remains `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n]`.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\); `n` must be less than or equal to 4; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n]`; `i` is `n + 1`**.
