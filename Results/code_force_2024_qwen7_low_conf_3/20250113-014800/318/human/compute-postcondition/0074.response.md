Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice. If `n` is odd, the additional element `n` is included in the list.

### Loop Code
```
for i in range(n):
    print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis of Each Iteration
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, `print(a[i], end=' ')` is executed, printing the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

### Final Values After All Iterations
- Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, it will print all elements of the list `a` exactly once.
- The value of `i` after the loop completes will be `n` (since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`).
- The value of `n` and `mid` do not change during the loop.
- The list `a` remains unchanged after the loop.

### Output State After All Iterations
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- `i` is `n` (since the loop increments `i` up to `n-1` and then stops).
- `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice. If `n` is odd, the additional element `n` is included in the list.
- The elements of `a` have been printed exactly once.

### Output State:
**Output State: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice. If `n` is odd, the additional element `n` is included in the list. The elements of `a` have been printed exactly once.**
