The code `a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. From the initial state, we know that `mid` is `n // 2` and `i` is 2. So, `a.append(mid + i)` will append the value of `mid + 2` to the list `a`. The value of `mid` remains `n // 2` and `i` remains 2.

After appending `mid + 2` to the list `a`, the list `a` becomes `[1, mid + 2]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mid`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1, mid + 2]`, `i` is 2**
