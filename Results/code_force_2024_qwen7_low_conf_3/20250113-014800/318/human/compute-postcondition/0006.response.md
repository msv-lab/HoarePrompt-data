The code appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `a` will be updated to contain `[1]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mid`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1]`, `i` is 2**
