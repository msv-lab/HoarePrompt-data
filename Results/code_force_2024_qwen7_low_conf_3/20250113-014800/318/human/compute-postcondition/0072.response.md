Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice.
   - The value of `a[i]` is printed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and still remain within the range `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` was within the range `0` to `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i + 1` must still be within the range `0` to `n-1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - If `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i + 1` would be `n`, which is out of the range `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop cannot continue.
   - If `i` was anything from `0` to `n-2`, then `i + 1` would still be within the range `0` to `n-1`, and the loop can continue.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` remains the same as it is a constant.
- `mid` remains the same since it is derived from `n` and does not change within the loop.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `a` remains the same as it is a static list defined outside the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-2`, `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice, and the value of `a[i]` is printed.**
