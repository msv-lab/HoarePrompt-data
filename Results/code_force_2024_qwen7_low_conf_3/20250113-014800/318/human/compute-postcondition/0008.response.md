According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is set to `2`, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range of `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.

Since `i` starts at `2` and increments by `1` each iteration, the loop will continue if `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2 + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `3` (since it is incremented by `1` each iteration). The condition `i <= n // 2 + 1` must still hold true.

Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `2`, and `mid` is `n // 2`, the value of `n // 2 + 1` will be `2` if `n` is `2`, and will increase as `n` increases. Since we need to check the condition for the next iteration, we assume `n` is at least `2` and `mid` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1, mid + 2]`, `i` is 3**
