The code snippet prints the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, but it does not change the value of any variable. The values of `n`, `mid`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice. If `n` is odd, the additional element `n` is included in the list. The value of `a[i]` is printed.**
