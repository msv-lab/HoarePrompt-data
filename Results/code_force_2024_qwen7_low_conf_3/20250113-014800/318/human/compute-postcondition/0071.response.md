The code prints `a[i]`. The value of `a[i+1]` is printed, but the value of `a[i]` is not explicitly used or changed in the code. The value of `i` remains the same, and the list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the print statement, which outputs `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice, and the value of `a[i]` is printed.**
