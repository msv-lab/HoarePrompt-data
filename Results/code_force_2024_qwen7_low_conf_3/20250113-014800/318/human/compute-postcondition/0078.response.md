Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the lengths of permutations `p`. For each test case, it generates a specific permutation `p` of length `n` and prints it. The generated permutation is constructed such that the first half consists of numbers from 1 to `n/2`, and the second half consists of numbers from `n/2 + 1` to `n`. If `n` is odd, the largest number `n` is appended to the permutation. The function ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` satisfy `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` within the generated permutation. However, the function does not check the divisibility condition within the generated permutation; it only constructs the permutation according to the specified pattern.**

**Edge Cases:**
- When `n` is odd, the largest number `n` is included in the permutation.
- The function handles multiple test cases, each with its own value of `t` and `n`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not verify whether the generated permutation satisfies the condition that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` satisfy `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. It only constructs the permutation based on the given pattern.
