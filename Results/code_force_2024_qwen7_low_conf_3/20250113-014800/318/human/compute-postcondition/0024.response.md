Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n // 2` followed by integers from `mid + 2` to `(n // 2) + n // 2`. If `n` is odd, the last element of `a` is `n`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop runs `n` times.
- For each iteration `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, the element `a[i]` is printed.

### Iteration Analysis:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `i` is 0 and the first element of `a` (which is 1) is printed.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `i` is 1 and the second element of `a` (which is 2) is printed.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `i` is 2 and the third element of `a` (which is 3) is printed.
- This pattern continues until the loop executes `n` times.

### Final Values:
- After the loop completes all `n` iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The last element printed will be `a[n-1]`.

### Determining the Last Element of `a`:
- If `n` is even, `a` contains integers from 1 to `n//2` followed by integers from `n//2 + 2` to `n//2 + n//2`. So, the last element `a[n-1]` will be `n//2 + n//2 = n`.
- If `n` is odd, `a` contains integers from 1 to `n//2` followed by integers from `n//2 + 2` to `n//2 + n//2` plus the additional element `n`. So, the last element `a[n-1]` will also be `n`.

### Conclusion:
- Regardless of whether `n` is even or odd, the last element printed will always be `n`.

### Output State:
- The loop will print all elements of the list `a`, which contains integers from 1 to `n // 2` followed by integers from `mid + 2` to `(n // 2) + n // 2`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` and the last element printed will be `n`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n // 2` followed by integers from `mid + 2` to `(n // 2) + n // 2`, and `i` is `n - 1` with the printed value being `n`.**
