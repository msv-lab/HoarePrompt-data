Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n // 2` followed by integers from `mid + 2` to `(n // 2) + n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // 2`.
- For each iteration, it appends `i` and `mid + i` to the list `a`.
- After the loop completes, `a` will contain all integers from 1 to `n // 2` followed by all integers from `mid + 2` to `(n // 2) + n // 2`.

Since the loop runs exactly `n // 2` times, and each time it appends two elements, the final list `a` will contain exactly `n` elements.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `n < 2`), `a` remains an empty list. However, based on the problem constraints, `t` and `n` are such that the loop will always execute at least once. Therefore, the only relevant case is when the loop executes fully.
