Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.
- `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice. If `n` is odd, the additional element `n` is included in the list.
- The value of `a[i]` is printed during each iteration.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.
3. **List `a`**: The list `a` contains elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice. The length of the list is `2 * mid` if `n` is even, or `2 * mid + 1` if `n` is odd.

### Next Iteration:
- To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

### Updated States:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The new value of `i` should still be within the range `0` to `n-1`.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice. If `n` is odd, the additional element `n` is included in the list. The value of `a[i+1]` is printed.**
