The code appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but the list `a` gains a new element which is `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list containing `[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list containing `[n]`**
