`a.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `a`. Since `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, and the current value of `n` is odd, the new value appended to `a` is `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated list `a` contains elements from `n` to `n + (n // 2) - 1` with each element appearing twice, plus the new element `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice and the additional element `n`.**
