`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged, but now `n` holds the integer input from the user. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer input from the user**
