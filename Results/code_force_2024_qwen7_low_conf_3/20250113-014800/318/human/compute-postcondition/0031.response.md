The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) to the list `a`. Since `i` was previously set to `n - 1`, the list `a` now contains this value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\)
- `n` must be at least 3
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- `a` is an empty list
- `i` is `n - 1`

After executing the code, the list `a` will contain one element, which is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is unchanged and satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\)
- `n` is unchanged and must be at least 3
- `mid` is unchanged and is `n // 2`
- `a` now contains `[n - 1]`
- `i` is unchanged and is `n - 1`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\), `n` must be at least 3, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`**
