The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\)
- `n` must be less than or equal to 4
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- `a` is `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n]`
- `i` is `n + 1`

Since `i` is defined as `n + 1`, appending `i` to `a` means adding `n + 1` to the list `a`. The updated list `a` will be `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n, n + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\); `n` must be less than or equal to 4; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n, n + 1]; `i` is `n + 1`**
