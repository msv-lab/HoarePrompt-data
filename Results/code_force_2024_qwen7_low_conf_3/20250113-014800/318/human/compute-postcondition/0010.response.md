The list `a` is updated by appending the value of `mid + i`. Given the initial conditions, `mid` is calculated as `n // 2`, and `i` is 3. So, the new element appended to `a` is `mid + 3`.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, let's denote `mid` as `n // 2`. Therefore, the new element in `a` is `(n // 2) + 3`.

The initial state of `a` is `[1, mid + 2, 3]`, which can be rewritten as `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3]` using the value of `mid`.

After appending `mid + 3` to `a`, the new list `a` becomes `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3, (n // 2) + 3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3, (n // 2) + 3]`, `i` is 3**
