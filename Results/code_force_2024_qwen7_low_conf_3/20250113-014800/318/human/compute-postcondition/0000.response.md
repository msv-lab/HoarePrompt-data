`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` remains as it was in the initial state because the code snippet does not involve `n`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) still holds true after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)**
