The code appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- `i` is `n`
- `a` is a list containing `[n]`

First, let's determine the values of `mid` and `i`:
- `mid = n // 2`
- `i = n`

Next, we append `mid + i` to the list `a`. The value of `mid + i` is:
- `mid + i = (n // 2) + n = (n // 2) + n`

Therefore, the new list `a` will be:
- `a = [n, (n // 2) + n]`

The other variables (`n`, `mid`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `n`; `a` is a list containing `[n, (n // 2) + n]`**
