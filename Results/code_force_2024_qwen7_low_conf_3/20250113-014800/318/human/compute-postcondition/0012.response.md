The code appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `a`. The initial value of `a` is `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3, (n // 2) + 3]`. After appending, the list `a` becomes `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3, (n // 2) + 3, 4]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- `a` is `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3, (n // 2) + 3, 4]`
- `i` is 4

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1, (n // 2) + 2, 3, (n // 2) + 3, 4]`, `i` is 4**
