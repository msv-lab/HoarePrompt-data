Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\); `n` is at most 4; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is a list containing elements `[n - 1, mid + (n - 1), n, mid + n, ..., k, mid + k]` where `k` ranges from `n - 1` to `2 * n - 2` in steps of 2; `i` is `2 * n - 1`; if `n` is odd, the list `a` includes an additional element `n`.***
