`a` is a list with its last element being `i`. The code appends `mid + i` to the list `a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `mid` is added to `i` to form the new element appended to the list.

Output State: **`a` is a list with its last element being `mid + i`, `i` is an integer or any other data type it was previously.**
