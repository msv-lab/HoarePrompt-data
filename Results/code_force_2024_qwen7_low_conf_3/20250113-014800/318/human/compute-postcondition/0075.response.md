The code `print('\n', end='')` prints a newline character without changing the end parameter (which is already set to an empty string by default). This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list containing elements from `n` to `n + mid - 1` with each element appearing twice. If `n` is odd, the additional element `n` is included in the list. The elements of `a` have been printed exactly once.**
