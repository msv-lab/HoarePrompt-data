Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `a` is a list containing `[n, (n // 2) + n]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` has been incremented by 1 from its initial value of `n`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` is `n + 1`.

4. **Loop Execution Criteria:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts at `n` and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n // 2 + 1`.

Given these points, we need to determine if `i` is still within the valid range for another iteration. Since `i` is now `n + 1`, it exceeds the upper limit of `n // 2 + 1` for any valid `n` (since `n + 1` is always greater than `n // 2 + 1` for `n >= 2`).

Therefore, the loop cannot execute another iteration because the condition `1 <= i <= n // 2 + 1` is no longer satisfied.

However, if we assume the task is to describe the state just before the loop exits, then the state would be:

- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.

Since the loop cannot execute another iteration, we do not need to adjust the states further for another iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing `[n, (n // 2) + n]`**
