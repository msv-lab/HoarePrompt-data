`a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `a` is `[n, (n // 2) + n, n + 1]`.

- `mid` is calculated as `n // 2`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- The expression `mid + i` becomes `(n // 2) + (n + 1)`, which simplifies to `(n // 2) + n + 1`.

Therefore, the updated list `a` will include the new value `(n // 2) + n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is `[n, (n // 2) + n, n + 1, (n // 2) + n + 1]`**
