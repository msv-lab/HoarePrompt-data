The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it seems the function might internally handle a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by a series of integers `n` representing the lengths of permutations `p`. The function must validate that for each permutation `p` of length `n`, no two distinct indices `i` and `j` satisfy the conditions `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

Given the output cases are not specified, we can infer that the function might return whether a given permutation satisfies the conditions or not. Since the problem statement does not specify the exact return values, we can only describe the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the lengths of permutations `p`, and checks if each permutation `p` of length `n` satisfies the condition that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` satisfy `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.**
