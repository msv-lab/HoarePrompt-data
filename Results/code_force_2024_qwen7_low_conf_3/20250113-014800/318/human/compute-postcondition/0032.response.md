`a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. From the initial state, `mid` is `n // 2` and `i` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `a.append(mid + i)` adds the value of `n // 2 + (n - 1)` to the list `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n`, we keep it as `n` in the expression.

The updated state of `a` is a list with the original element `[n - 1]` and the new element `n // 2 + (n - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t > 1\), `n` must be at least 3, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[n - 1, n // 2 + (n - 1)]`, `i` is `n - 1`**
