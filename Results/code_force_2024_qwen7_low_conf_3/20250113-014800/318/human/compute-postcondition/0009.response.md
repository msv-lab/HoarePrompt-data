`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 3, to the list `a`. The initial list `a` is `[1, mid + 2]`. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, the list `a` becomes `[1, mid + 2, 3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1, mid + 2, 3]`, `i` is 3**
