Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Each n represents the length of the permutation p, which must be a sequence of n distinct integers from 1 to n such that no two distinct indices i and j satisfy the conditions p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.**
