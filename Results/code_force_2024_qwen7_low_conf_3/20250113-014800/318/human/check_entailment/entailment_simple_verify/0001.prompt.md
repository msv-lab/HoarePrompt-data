You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

    t = int(input())

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given Python program attempts to generate a permutation `p` of length `n` where no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j`) satisfy the condition that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`.
3. It initializes a list `a` and populates it with pairs of numbers such that each pair consists of `i` and `mid + i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n // 2`. This creates a sequence where the first half of the permutation contains smaller numbers, and the second half contains larger numbers.
4. If `n` is odd, it adds `n` itself to the list `a`.
5. Finally, it prints out the permutation.

Let's analyze whether this approach satisfies the required conditions:

- For even `n`, the permutation will look like `[1, n/2 + 1, 2, n/2 + 2, ..., n/2, n]`.
- For odd `n`, it will look like `[1, (n+1)/2 + 1, 2, (n+1)/2 + 2, ..., (n+1)/2, n]`.

### Checking the Conditions:
1. **Divisibility Condition**: Consider the constructed permutation. If `i < j`, the smallest element among the first `i` elements (`p_i`) is always less than the smallest element among the last `i` elements (`p_{i+n//2}`). Since `p_{i+n//2} > p_i`, `p_i` cannot divide `p_{i+n//2}`. Similarly, `p_{i+1}` is always greater than `p_{j+1}` if `i < j`, making `p_{i+1}` unable to divide `p_{j+1}`.

2. **No Duplicates and Valid Range**: Each element in the generated list is unique and within the range `[1, n]`.

Thus, the constructed permutation should satisfy the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program generates a permutation that meets the specified conditions for all valid inputs under the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
