Reasoning: 
The program's logic constructs a permutation based on a specific pattern. For each test case, it generates a permutation `p` of length `n` by splitting the sequence into two halves: the first half contains numbers from 1 to `n//2`, and the second half contains numbers from `n//2 + 1` to `n`. If `n` is odd, the largest number `n` is appended to the permutation. This construction ensures that the elements in the first half and the second half do not divide each other directly. Additionally, because the elements in the first half are smaller than those in the second half, and the largest element is placed last if `n` is odd, the divisibility condition \( p_i \mid p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \mid p_{j+1} \) is inherently avoided.

Given the constraints and the nature of the generated permutation, the program does not need to explicitly check the divisibility condition after constructing the permutation. The construction method itself guarantees that no such pairs exist. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
