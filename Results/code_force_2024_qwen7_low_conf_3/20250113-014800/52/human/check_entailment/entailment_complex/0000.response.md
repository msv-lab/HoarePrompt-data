Reasoning:
1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases within the given constraints. It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case independently.
2. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values of `n` and `m`, as well as the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. **Sorting Arrays**: The arrays `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending and descending order respectively. This sorting ensures that the maximum difference can be calculated efficiently.
4. **Circular Reference Handling**: The function correctly handles the circular nature of the lists using the modulo operation (`a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]`), ensuring that the differences are calculated properly even when `i` exceeds the bounds of the list.
5. **Difference Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the total difference `D` by summing the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
