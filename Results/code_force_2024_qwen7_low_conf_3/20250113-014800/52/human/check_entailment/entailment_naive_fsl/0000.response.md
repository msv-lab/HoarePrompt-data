Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum total difference \(D\) as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the line `diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` is incorrect. It incorrectly uses `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]`, which do not align with the intended logic of pairing each element of array \(a\) with an element from array \(b\) to maximize the difference.

The correct approach should be to pair each element of array \(a\) with the closest possible element in array \(b\) from either the start or the end of the sorted \(b\) array. The given implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results in many cases. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4 6
1 2 3 4
8 7 5 1 2 3
```

The expected output is 10, but the program outputs 14. This is because the program incorrectly pairs elements, failing to maximize the differences.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is hence incorrect.
