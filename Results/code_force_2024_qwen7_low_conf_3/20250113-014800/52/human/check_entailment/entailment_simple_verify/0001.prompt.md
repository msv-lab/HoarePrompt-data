You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by arrays `a` and `b`.
3. The program sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `b` in descending order.
4. It initializes a variable `diff` to accumulate the total difference.
5. In the loop, it calculates the maximum difference between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` and adds it to `diff`. Note that for the last few elements, it uses `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]` which might not be the intended behavior since `i` would already be within bounds for most of the elements. However, this is a minor issue and doesn't affect the overall correctness for the given problem constraints.

Given the problem description and the approach taken by the program, the key steps are correct:
- Sorting `a` in ascending order ensures we consider the smallest elements.
- Sorting `b` in descending order ensures we consider the largest elements.
- Taking the maximum of differences helps maximize the total difference.

However, there is a potential edge case where the indices `i - n` might be out of bounds for the first few iterations when `i < n`. To fix this, we should directly compare `a[i]` with `b[i]` without using negative indices.

Here's the corrected reasoning:

- The program logic is fundamentally sound for maximizing the total difference.
- The only flaw is in the handling of the last few elements which might lead to incorrect comparisons. We should directly compare `a[i]` with `b[i]` for all `i`.

Given these points, the original program should be slightly adjusted but is fundamentally correct.

Correctness: **False**

This is because the original program has a small logical flaw due to the use of `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]` which might cause out-of-bound issues. A more robust version would be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        b.sort(reverse=True)
        diff = 0
        for i in range(n):
            diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[-i-1] - b[-i-1]))  # Use correct indices here
        print(diff)
```

With this adjustment, the program would be correct.
