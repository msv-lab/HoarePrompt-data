The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This changes the state of `a`, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers (new list from user input), `i` is 1, `diff` is the maximum of all differences calculated over the entire length of the lists `a` and `b` considering the constraints given by the indices `i` and `i - n`.**
