`s2` is incremented by 1. The values of `sum1`, `sum2`, `d`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[s2-1]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2-1])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `s1` is `s1 + 1`; `s2` is `s2 + 1`.
Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[s2-1]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2-1])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `s1` is `s1 + 1`; `s2` is `s2 + 1`**
