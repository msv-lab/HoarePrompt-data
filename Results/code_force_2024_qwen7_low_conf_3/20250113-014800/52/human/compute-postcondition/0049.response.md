The code `d += max(sum1, sum2)` updates the variable `d` by adding to it the maximum value between `sum1` and `sum2`. Since `sum1` and `sum2` are defined as follows:

- `sum1 = abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`
- `sum2 = abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`

The exact values of `sum1` and `sum2` are not provided, so we keep them as they are. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])**
