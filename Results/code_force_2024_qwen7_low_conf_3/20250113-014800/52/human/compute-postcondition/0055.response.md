The code updates `sum1` to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`. Given the initial state, `s1` is 1 and `s2` is 1, and `e1` is `n - 2` and `e2` is `m - 2`. Therefore, `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not relevant here, `arr1` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`**.
