`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split. The input is expected to be two integers separated by space for `n` and `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and it is greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split; `a` is a list of integers created by splitting and converting the input**
