`s1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])), `i` is `i + 1**
