`e2` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `m - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` must be greater than 5, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 3, `s2` is 3, `e1` is `n - 4`, `e2` is `m - 4`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2]))`, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`.**
