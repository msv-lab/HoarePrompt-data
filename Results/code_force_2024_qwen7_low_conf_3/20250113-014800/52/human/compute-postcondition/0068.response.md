The code `e1 -= 1` decrements the value of `e1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[s2-1]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2-1])`
- `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`
- `s1` is `s1 + 1`
- `s2` is `s2 + 1`
- `e1` is `e1 - 1`

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[s2-1]) + abs(arr1[e1-1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2-1])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `s1` is `s1 + 1`; `s2` is `s2 + 1`, `e1` is `e1 - 1`**
