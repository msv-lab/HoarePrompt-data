Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
- `diff` is the previous value of `diff` plus `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`.

### Loop Execution:
The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`. In each iteration, the value of `diff` is updated based on the two absolute differences:
1. `abs(a[i] - b[i])`
2. `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`

### Updated States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `previous_i + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 again, making it `previous_i + 2`.
2. **`diff`**: The value of `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of the two absolute differences to its previous value. Therefore, the new value of `diff` will be the previous value of `diff` plus the maximum of the two absolute differences for the current `i`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be `previous_i + 2`.
- `diff` should be the previous value of `diff` plus the maximum of the two absolute differences for the current `i`.

### Output State:
**`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `previous_i + 2`, `diff` is the previous value of `diff` plus `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`.**
