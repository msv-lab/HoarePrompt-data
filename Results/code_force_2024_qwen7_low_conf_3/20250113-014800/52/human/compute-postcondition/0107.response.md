To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the given information and the pattern observed in the initial states.

### Loop Analysis
The loop continues as long as `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2`. In each iteration, the following operations are performed:
- Calculate `sum1` and `sum2` using the current values of `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, and `e2`.
- Update `d` by adding the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2`.
- Increment `s1` and `s2` by 1.
- Decrement `e1` and `e2` by 1.

### Observations
1. **Initial Values**: `s1 = 0`, `s2 = 0`, `e1 = n - 1`, `e2 = m - 1`.
2. **After Each Iteration**:
   - `s1` and `s2` increase by 1.
   - `e1` and `e2` decrease by 1.
   - The loop continues until `s1` no longer satisfies `s1 < e1` or `s2` no longer satisfies `s2 < e2`.

### Termination Condition
The loop will terminate when either `s1` equals `e1` or `s2` equals `e2`. This means that after the loop ends, we have:
- `s1 == e1` and `s2 == e2`.

### Calculating `d`
For each pair `(s1, s2)` and `(e1, e2)`, the value of `d` accumulates the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2`. Since `s1` and `s2` start at 0 and increase by 1 each iteration, and `e1` and `e2` start at `n-1` and `m-1` and decrease by 1 each iteration, the loop will iterate exactly `min(n, m)/2` times.

Thus, `d` will be the sum of the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2` for each iteration.

### Final Values
- `arr1` and `arr2` remain unchanged since they are only accessed within the loop but not modified.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged since they are also not modified within the loop.
- `cases` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
- `t` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
- `s1` and `s2` will both be equal to `min(n, m)/2`.
- `e1` and `e2` will both be equal to `max(n, m)/2 - 1`.
- `i` will be the number of iterations + 1, which is `min(n, m)/2 + 1`.
- `d` will be the accumulated sum of the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2` for each iteration.

### Output State
Given the above analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed can be described as follows:

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is the original input integer, `m` is the original input integer, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is `min(n, m)/2`, `s2` is `min(n, m)/2`, `e1` is `max(n, m)/2 - 1`, `e2` is `max(n, m)/2 - 1`, `d` is the sum of the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2` for each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations + 1.**
