Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The `while` loop condition is `s1 < e1 and s2 < e2`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr1` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `arr2` is a sorted list of integers from the new input.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s1` is 1.
   - `s2` is 1.
   - `e1` is `n - 2`.
   - `e2` is `m - 2`.
   - `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`.
   - `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` must hold true.
   - Currently, `s1` is 1 and `e1` is `n - 2`, so `s1 < e1` holds as long as `n > 3`.
   - Similarly, `s2` is 1 and `e2` is `m - 2`, so `s2 < e2` holds as long as `m > 3`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be greater than 3 (to keep `s1 < e1`).
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `m` must be greater than 3 (to keep `s2 < e2`).

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the states such that both `n` and `m` satisfy the requirement for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final State:**
- `total` is not relevant here.
- `arr1` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `arr2` is a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- `s1` is 1.
- `s2` is 1.
- `e1` is `n - 2`.
- `e2` is `m - 2`.
- `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`.
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`.
