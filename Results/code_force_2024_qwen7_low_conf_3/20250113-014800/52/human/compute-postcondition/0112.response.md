Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `cases` is the original input integer, `n` and `m` are the input integers from the first iteration, `arr1` and `arr2` are the input lists of integers from the first iteration and remain unchanged, `s1` and `s2` are the last values updated by the loop (either `n-1` and `m-1` or the indices where the loop stops), `e1` and `e2` are the last values updated by the loop (either 0 or the indices where the loop stops), `d` is the final value calculated by the loop, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted arrays as the loop progresses.**
