Let's break down the conditions for the loop to execute one more time:

The `while` loop condition is `s1 < e1 and s2 < e2`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s1` is 1
- `e1` is `n - 2`
- `s2` is 1
- `e2` is `m - 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` must hold true.

1. The condition `s1 < e1` translates to `1 < n - 2`, which simplifies to `n > 3`.
2. The condition `s2 < e2` translates to `1 < m - 2`, which simplifies to `m > 3`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states to ensure that both `n` and `m` are greater than 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `s1`, `e1`, `s2`, and `e2`, and these are already correctly set based on `n` and `m`.

So, the adjusted states are:
State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])), `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])**
