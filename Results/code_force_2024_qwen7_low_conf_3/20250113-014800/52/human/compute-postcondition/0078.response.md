The code initializes `arr2` as a list of integers based on user input. This means `arr1` remains unchanged, and `arr2` is now a list of integers derived from the input. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cases`, `t`, `s1`, `s2`, `e2`, `d`, and `i`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers based on the input, `arr2` is a list of integers based on user input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is equal to `e1`, `s2` is the middle index of `arr2`, `e2` is `s2 - 1`, `d` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])` and `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2])` to its current value, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `d` is printed**
