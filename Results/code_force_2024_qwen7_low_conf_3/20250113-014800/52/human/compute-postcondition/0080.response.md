The code snippet `arr2.sort()` sorts the list `arr2` in ascending order. This impacts the list `arr2` itself, but does not change the values of the other variables. After sorting, `arr2` will be in ascending order.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is equal to `e1`, `s2` is the middle index of `arr2`, `e2` is `s2 - 1`, `d` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])` and `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2])` to its current value, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `d` is printed**
