Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `arr1` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `arr2` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `m` must be greater than 3.
   - `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s1` is 2.
   - `s2` is 2.
   - `e1` is `n - 3`.
   - `e2` is `m - 3`.
   - `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1]))`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs as long as `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` are true.

   - Since `s1` is 2 and `e1` is `n - 3`, for `s1 < e1` to hold true, `n - 3` must be greater than 2. This means `n` must be greater than 5.
   - Similarly, since `s2` is 2 and `e2` is `m - 3`, for `s2 < e2` to hold true, `m - 3` must be greater than 2. This means `m` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the values of `n` and `m` to be greater than 5.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `n` must be greater than 5.
- `m` must be greater than 5.

The other states do not need to be adjusted because they are either not part of the loop condition or their values do not affect the loop continuation.

**State:**
**`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` must be greater than 5, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])), `i` is `i + 1**
