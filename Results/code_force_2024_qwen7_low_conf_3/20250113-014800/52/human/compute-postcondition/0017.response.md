The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m`, but does not affect the other variables. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `a` and `b` remain as lists of integers sorted in ascending and descending order respectively. The value of `i` is set to the new value of `n`, and `diff` is undefined until further computation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an integer from the first input, `m` is an integer from the second input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `n`, `diff` is undefined**
