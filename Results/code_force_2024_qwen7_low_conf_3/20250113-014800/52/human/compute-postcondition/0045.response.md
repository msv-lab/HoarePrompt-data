The code prints the value of `diff`. Since `diff` is already calculated before the print statement, the print statement does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `n + 1`, `diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` and `(a[i - n], b[i - n])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, the value of `diff` is printed.**
