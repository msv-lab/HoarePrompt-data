`e2` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`sum1`, `sum2`, `d`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`) remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[s2-1]) + abs(arr1[e1-1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2-1])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `s1` is `s1 + 1`; `s2` is `s2 + 1`, `e1` is `e1 - 1`, `e2` is `e2 - 1`**
