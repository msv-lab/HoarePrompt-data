The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This affects the variables `n` and `m`, but does not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `diff`.

Output State: **`t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `diff` is the maximum of all differences calculated over the entire length of the lists `a` and `b` considering the constraints given by the indices `i` and `i - n`**.
