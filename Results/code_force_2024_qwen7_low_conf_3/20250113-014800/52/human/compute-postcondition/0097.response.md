`e1` is decremented by 1. Since `e1` was originally `n - 2`, the new value of `e1` is now `(n - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])) + max(abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])), `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`**
