The code snippet increments `d` by the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2`. The values of `sum1` and `sum2` are given in the initial state, but their specific numerical values are not provided. We know that:

- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`

The variable `d` is incremented by the maximum of these two expressions. Since we don't have specific values for `arr1`, `arr2`, `s1`, `s2`, and `e1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `max(sum1, sum2)`, but we can represent it symbolically.

The output state will reflect this symbolic update:

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
