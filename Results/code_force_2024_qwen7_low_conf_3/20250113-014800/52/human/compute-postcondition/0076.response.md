The code snippet reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m`, but does not affect any other variables. The initial values of `arr1`, `arr2`, `cases`, `t`, `s1`, `s2`, `e2`, `d`, `i`, and the fact that `d` is printed remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` and `arr2` remain unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is equal to `e1`, `s2` is the middle index of `arr2`, `e2` is `s2 - 1`, `d` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])` and `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2])` to its current value, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `d` is printed**
