Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers \( n \) and \( m \), along with two lists of integers \( a_i \) and \( b_i \). It then sorts these lists and calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists as the lists are traversed from both ends towards the center. Specifically, for each pair of elements, it computes the maximum of two possible sums of absolute differences, one where the smallest elements of both lists are considered and the other where the largest elements of both lists are considered. This process continues until all elements have been processed. If the lists have an odd number of elements, the function adds the remaining elementâ€™s difference to the total. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case. The function handles cases where the lists might have different lengths and ensures that the total sum respects the constraints given.**
