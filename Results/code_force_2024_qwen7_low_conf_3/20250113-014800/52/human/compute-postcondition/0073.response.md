Postcondition: ***`arr1` and `arr2` remain unchanged, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is equal to `e1`, `s2` is the middle index of `arr2`, `e2` is `s2 - 1`, `d` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])` and `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2])` to its current value, `i` is the number of iterations.***
