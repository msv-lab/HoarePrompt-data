The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`. 

Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0 (but is decremented by 1), `t` is now between 0 and 99 inclusive. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `i` are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain as they were in the initial state. However, the value of `b` changes to the list of integers read from the input.

The output state is: `t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the first input, `m` is an integer from the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the input sequence, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and converted to integers, `i` is `n`, `diff` is undefined.

Output State: **`t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the first input, `m` is an integer from the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the input sequence, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and converted to integers, `i` is `n`, `diff` is undefined**
