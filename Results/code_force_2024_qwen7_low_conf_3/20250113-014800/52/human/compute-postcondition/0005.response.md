The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, the elements of `a` will be sorted. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Let's denote the elements of the list `a` before sorting as `a[0], a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1]`. After sorting, these elements will be in ascending order, but their specific values will depend on the original input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split; `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split.**
