Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `arr1` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `arr2` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `m` must be greater than 3.
   - `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s1` is 1.
   - `s2` is 1.
   - `e1` is `n - 2`.
   - `e2` is `m - 2`.
   - `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`.

2. The code snippet updates `sum2` as follows:
   ```python
   sum2 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])
   ```
   Given the values:
   - `s1` is 1.
   - `s2` is 1.
   - `e1` is `n - 2`.
   - `e2` is `m - 2`.

3. Substituting these values into the equation for `sum2`:
   ```python
   sum2 = abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])
   ```

4. The variables that are updated by this line of code are `sum2`. All other variables remain in their initial state or as they were after the previous steps.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])**
