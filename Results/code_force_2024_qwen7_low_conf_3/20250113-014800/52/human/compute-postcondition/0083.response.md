To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions under which the `while` loop will run. The loop condition is `s1 < e1 and s2 < e2`.

Let's break down the current state:

- `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `cases` is greater than 0.
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- `s1` is 0.
- `s2` is 0.
- `e1` is `n - 1`.
- `e2` is `m - 1`.
- `d` is 0.
- `i` is the number of iterations + 1.
- `d` is printed.

The loop will continue as long as both `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` are true.

Given the initial values:
- `s1 = 0`
- `e1 = n - 1`
- `s2 = 0`
- `e2 = m - 1`

For the loop to execute at least once:
1. `s1` must be less than `e1`.
2. `s2` must be less than `e2`.

Since `s1` is 0 and `e1` is `n - 1`, `s1 < e1` is already true as long as `n > 0`. Similarly, since `s2` is 0 and `e2` is `m - 1`, `s2 < e2` is already true as long as `m > 0`.

Therefore, no state needs to be adjusted because the loop can certainly execute at least one time given the current values of `n` and `m`.

State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is 0, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `d` is printed**
