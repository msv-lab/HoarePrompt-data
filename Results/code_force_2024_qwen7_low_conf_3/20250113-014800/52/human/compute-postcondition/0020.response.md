`a` is sorted in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the first input, `m` is an integer from the second input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and converted to integers, `i` is `n`, `diff` is undefined.
