`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from the `input()` function, which splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and it is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and it is greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and it is greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split.**
