`e2` is decremented by 1. Since `e2` was initially `m - 1`, the new value of `e2` is `(m - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `m - 2`. 

The states of all other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`**
