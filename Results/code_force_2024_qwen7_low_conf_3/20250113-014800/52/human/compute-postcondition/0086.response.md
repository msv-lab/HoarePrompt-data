The code increments `d` by `max(sum1, sum2)`. The values of `sum1` and `sum2` are given as follows:

- `sum1 = abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`
- `sum2 = abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`

Since the exact values of `arr1` and `arr2` are not provided, we keep these expressions as they are. Therefore, `d` is updated to `d + max(sum1, sum2)`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])), `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])**.
