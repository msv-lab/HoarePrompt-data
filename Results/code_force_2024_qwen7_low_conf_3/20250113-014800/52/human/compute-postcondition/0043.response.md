Given the initial state, let's analyze the code step by step:

- `t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `i` is 4.
- `diff` is updated to be its current value plus the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`.

The code snippet updates `diff` as follows:
```python
diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))
```

Breaking it down:
1. `i` is 4, so `a[i]` is `a[4]`.
2. `a[4]` refers to the fifth element in the list `a`.
3. `a[i - n]` is `a[4 - n]`.
4. `b[i]` is `b[4]`, which refers to the fifth element in the list `b`.
5. `b[i - n]` is `b[4 - n]`, which refers to the fifth element from the end of the list `b`.

So the expression `max(abs(a[4] - b[4]), abs(a[4 - n] - b[4 - n]))` is being added to `diff`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not given, we cannot specify the exact numerical value of `max(abs(a[4] - b[4]), abs(a[4 - n] - b[4 - n]))`. However, we know it will be the maximum of the two absolute differences.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 4, `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[4] - b[4])` and `abs(a[4 - n] - b[4 - n])` to its current value.**
