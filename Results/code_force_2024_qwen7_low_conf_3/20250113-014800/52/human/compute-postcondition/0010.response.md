Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
   - `diff` is `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - To execute the next iteration, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was incremented from the previous iteration, `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `diff` needs to be recalculated with the updated `i` value.

Given the initial states and the loop condition, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
- `diff` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `diff` are not given, we will keep them as placeholders and adjust only `i`.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
- `diff` is `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`.

Therefore, the final state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `diff` is `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))**
