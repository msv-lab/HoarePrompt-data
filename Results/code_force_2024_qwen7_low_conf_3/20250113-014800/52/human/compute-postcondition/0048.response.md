Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). It sorts \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order. Then, it calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of \( a \) and \( b \), considering the circular nature of the lists (i.e., \( a[i - n] \) and \( b[i - n] \)). Finally, it prints the computed sum for each test case. The function handles up to 100 test cases, with each test case having \( n \) and \( m \) satisfying \( 1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and the total sum of all \( m \) values not exceeding \( 2 \times 10^5 \). The function ensures that all test cases are processed correctly and the results are printed accordingly. Potential edge cases include scenarios where \( n \) or \( m \) are at their respective boundaries, and the function also correctly handles the circular reference for the lists when \( i \) reaches the end of the list.**
