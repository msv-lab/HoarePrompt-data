Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `n`, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for all valid `i` values from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- In each iteration, `diff` is updated by adding `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` to its current value.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, and `diff` will be the cumulative sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated over all valid `i` values from 0 to `n-1`.

Since the loop will execute `n` times (as long as `n` is a positive integer), the final value of `diff` will be the sum of the maximum absolute differences for all indices `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
