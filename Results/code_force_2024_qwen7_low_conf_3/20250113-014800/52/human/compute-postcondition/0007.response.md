The code initializes the variable `diff` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of 0 to `diff`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split; `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `diff` is 0.**
