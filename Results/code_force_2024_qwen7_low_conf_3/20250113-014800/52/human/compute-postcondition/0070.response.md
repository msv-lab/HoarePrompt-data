Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes.

### Initial State:
- `arr1` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `arr2` is a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- `n` is an integer from input.
- `m` is an integer from input.
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- `s1` is 0.
- `s2` is 0.
- `e1` is `n - 1`.
- `e2` is `m - 1`.
- `d` is 0.
- `i` is 0 (assuming `i` is incremented outside the loop).

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs as long as `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2`.

### Loop Body:
- Calculate `sum1` and `sum2`:
  \[
  \text{sum1} = | \text{arr1}[s1] - \text{arr2}[s2] | + | \text{arr1}[e1] - \text{arr2}[e2] |
  \]
  \[
  \text{sum2} = | \text{arr1}[s1] - \text{arr2}[e2] | + | \text{arr1}[e1] - \text{arr2}[s2] |
  \]
- Update `d`:
  \[
  d += \max(\text{sum1}, \text{sum2})
  \]
- Increment `s1` and `s2`:
  \[
  s1 += 1
  \]
  \[
  s2 += 1
  \]
- Decrement `e1` and `e2`:
  \[
  e1 -= 1
  \]
  \[
  e2 -= 1
  \]

### Analysis:
- Each iteration of the loop reduces the range `[s1, e1]` and `[s2, e2]` by one element on both ends.
- The loop continues until `s1` meets or exceeds `e1` and `s2` meets or exceeds `e2`.

### Final State:
After the loop terminates, we have:
- `s1 == e1` and `s2 == e2`. This means `s1` and `s2` have met at the middle point, and `e1` and `e2` have been reduced to the same value.
- The loop condition ensures that the last elements considered were the middle ones in the respective arrays.

### Calculating the Values:
- `s1` and `s2` will be `n/2` and `m/2` respectively, assuming `n` and `m` are even. If they are odd, `s1` and `s2` will be the floor division of `n` and `m` by 2.
- `e1` and `e2` will be `s1 - 1` and `s2 - 1` respectively.

### Output State:
Since the loop iterates until `s1 == e1` and `s2 == e2`, the final state of the loop can be described as follows:
- `arr1` remains unchanged.
- `arr2` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `m` are unchanged.
- `cases` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `s1` is the middle index of `arr1`, and `s2` is the middle index of `arr2`.
- `s2` is also the middle index of `arr2`, and `e1` and `e2` are the indices just before the middle.
- `d` is the accumulated value of `max(sum1, sum2)` for each iteration.
- `i` is incremented by the number of iterations.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`arr1` and `arr2` are unchanged, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is the middle index of `arr1`, `s2` is the middle index of `arr2`, `e1` is `s1 - 1`, `e2` is `s2 - 1`, `d` is the sum of `max(sum1, sum2)` for each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations**
