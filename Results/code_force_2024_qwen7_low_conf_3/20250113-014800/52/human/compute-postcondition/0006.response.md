The code sorts the list `b` in descending order using `b.sort(reverse=True)`. This means that the elements in `b` will be rearranged from the largest to the smallest. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since the initial state of `b` is not specified, we'll denote it as a list of integers before sorting. After sorting, the list `b` will contain its elements in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split; `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
