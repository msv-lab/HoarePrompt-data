Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while s1 < e1 and s2 < e2`.
- Current values: 
  - `s1` is 2
  - `s2` is 2
  - `e1` is `n - 3`
  - `e2` is `m - 3`

### Loop Condition Analysis:
The loop will continue as long as both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` are true.

#### Condition 1: `s1 < e1`
- `s1` is currently 2.
- `e1` is `n - 3`.

For the loop to continue, `s1` must be less than `e1`:
\[ s1 < e1 \]
\[ 2 < n - 3 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ n > 5 \]

#### Condition 2: `s2 < e2`
- `s2` is currently 2.
- `e2` is `m - 3`.

For the loop to continue, `s2` must be less than `e2`:
\[ s2 < e2 \]
\[ 2 < m - 3 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ m > 5 \]

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, both `n` and `m` must be greater than 5. Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure that `n` and `m` are greater than 5.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` must be greater than 5, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])) + max(abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])), `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`**
