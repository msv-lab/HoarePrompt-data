`sum2` is reassigned to the value of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`. Given that `s1` is 2 and `s2` is 2, and `e1` is `n - 3` and `e2` is `m - 3`, we can substitute these values into the equation:

- `sum2 = abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` must be greater than 5, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])) + max(abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])), `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`**
