The code sorts the list `b` in descending order. This changes the value of `b`, but does not affect the other variables. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, and `diff` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `diff` is the maximum of all differences calculated over the entire length of the lists `a` and `b` considering the constraints given by the indices `i` and `i - n`.**
