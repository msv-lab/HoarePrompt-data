The code prints the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is already calculated before the print statement, and printing does not change the value of `diff` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `n`, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for all valid `i` values from 0 to `n-1`, the value of `diff` is printed.**
