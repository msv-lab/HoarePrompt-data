`diff` is updated by adding the maximum absolute difference between the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` and the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` shifted by `n`. Since `i` and `i - n` are not defined before this operation, they are assumed to be within the bounds of the lists `a` and `b`.

Given the initial conditions, let's assume `i` and `i - n` are valid indices. The value of `diff` is incremented by the maximum of two absolute differences:

1. `abs(a[i] - b[i])`
2. `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`

Therefore, the updated state for `diff` is the original value of `diff` (which is 0) plus the maximum of these two absolute differences.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `diff` is `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`**
