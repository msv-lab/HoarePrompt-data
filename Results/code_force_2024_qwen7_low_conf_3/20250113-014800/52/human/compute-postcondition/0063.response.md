The given code snippet updates the value of `sum1`. Specifically, `sum1` is assigned the value of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`. The values of `arr1`, `arr2`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, and `e2` are used in this calculation, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `sum1` will be the result of the expression involving these variables.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`**
