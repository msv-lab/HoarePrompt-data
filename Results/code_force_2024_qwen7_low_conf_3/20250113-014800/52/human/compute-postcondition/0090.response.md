The code `e2 -= 1` decrements the value of `e2` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `e2` is equal to `m - 1`. Therefore, after the decrement, `e2` becomes `(m - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `m - 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])), `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])**
