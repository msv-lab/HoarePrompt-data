Postcondition: ***`arr1` and `arr2` are lists of integers sorted in ascending order. `n` and `m` are the original input integers. `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. If `s1` equals `e1`, then `d` is the original value of `d` plus the maximum of `abs(arr1[min(n, m)/2] - arr2[min(n, m)/2])` and `abs(arr1[min(n, m)/2] - arr2[max(n, m)/2 - 1])`. Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged. `i` is the number of iterations + 1.***
