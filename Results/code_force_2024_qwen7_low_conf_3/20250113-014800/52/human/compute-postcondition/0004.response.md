The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple substrings, and converts each substring into an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Let's denote the input as a line of space-separated integers. Suppose the input is `x y z` (where `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers).

After executing the code:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0.
- `n` remains the integer obtained from the first input split.
- `m` remains the integer obtained from the second input split.
- `a` remains a list of integers created by splitting and converting the input.
- `b` is now a list of integers obtained from the current input split.

To be more specific, if the input was `x y z`, then:
- `b` would be `[x, y, z]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split; `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split; `a` is a list of integers created by splitting and converting the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split.**
