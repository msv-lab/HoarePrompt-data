The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will take in multiple test cases, where each test case consists of:
- An integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- For each test case, two integers `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
- Two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).

Given the nature of the problem, the function likely processes each test case according to some logic involving `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`, but the specific return value is not detailed in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`, and processes them according to some logic.**
