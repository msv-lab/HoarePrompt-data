Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for all valid `i` values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The value of `diff` is printed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will iterate `t` times. Since we are looking at the start of the next iteration, we need to determine the new state after the current iteration.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. So, if `t` was `k` at the start of the current iteration, it will be `k-1` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `t` will be `t-1`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `diff`) remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is a positive integer, `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `n`, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for all valid `i` values from 0 to `n-1`**.
