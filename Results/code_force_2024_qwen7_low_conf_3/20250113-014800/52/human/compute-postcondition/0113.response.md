The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to process a series of test cases internally, where for each test case, it accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. The function processes these parameters based on the given constraints: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of all `m` values does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). Additionally, `a_i` and `b_i` are integers where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`.

Given the output cases provided but not explicitly stated, the function likely returns different results based on the processed data from these parameters. However, since the exact return values are not specified, we can only describe the input constraints and structure.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` under specified constraints, and returns results based on these parameters.**
