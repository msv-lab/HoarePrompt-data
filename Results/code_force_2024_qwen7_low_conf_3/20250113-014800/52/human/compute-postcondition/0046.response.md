Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is the integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `diff` is the final sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for all valid `i` values from 0 to `n-1`, the value of `diff` is printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- For each iteration, `n` and `m` are read from the input, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
- The lists `a` and `b` are sorted: `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.
- Inside the loop, the variable `diff` accumulates the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for all valid `i` values from 0 to `n-1`.
- After all iterations, the value of `diff` is printed.

Since the loop runs `t` times, after all iterations, `t` will be the total number of iterations, and `diff` will be the final sum accumulated across all iterations. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) will be the last values obtained from the inputs during the last iteration of the loop.
