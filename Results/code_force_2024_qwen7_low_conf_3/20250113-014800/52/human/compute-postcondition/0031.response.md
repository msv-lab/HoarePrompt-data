Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is an integer from the second input.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `diff` is the maximum of all differences calculated over the entire length of the lists `a` and `b` considering the constraints given by the indices `i` and `i - n`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `t` times. Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` within its body, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is 0) and must still be less than `t`.

Given this, we adjust the state as follows:
- `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `diff`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer from the second input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `diff` is the maximum of all differences calculated over the entire length of the lists `a` and `b` considering the constraints given by the indices `i` and `i - n`.**
