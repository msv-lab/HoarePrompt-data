The code assigns the values 0 to `s1`, 0 to `s2`, `n - 1` to `e1`, and `m - 1` to `e2`. The values of `arr1`, `arr2`, `n`, `m`, `cases`, `t`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`, and `i` are updated accordingly.

- `s1` is updated to 0.
- `s2` is updated to 0.
- `e1` is updated to `n - 1`.
- `e2` is updated to `m - 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])` and `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2])` to its current value, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `d` is printed**.
