According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. The loop will execute again as long as `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr1` and `arr2` remain unchanged
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100
- `s1` is equal to `e1`
- `s2` is the middle index of `arr2`
- `e2` is `s2 - 1`
- `d` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])` and `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2])` to its current value
- `i` is the number of iterations
- `d` is printed

For the loop to execute one more time, `cases` must be greater than 0 (since `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, reducing it by 1 will still leave it greater than or equal to 0).

Therefore, we need to decrement `cases` by 1 and ensure it remains greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`arr1` and `arr2` remain unchanged, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is equal to `e1`, `s2` is the middle index of `arr2`, `e2` is `s2 - 1`, `d` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])` and `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2])` to its current value, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `d` is printed**
