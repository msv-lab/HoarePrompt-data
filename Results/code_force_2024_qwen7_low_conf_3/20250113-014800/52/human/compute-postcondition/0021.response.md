The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in descending order. This means that the elements in `b` will be rearranged from the largest to the smallest value. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the first input, `m` is an integer from the second input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `n`, `diff` is undefined**
