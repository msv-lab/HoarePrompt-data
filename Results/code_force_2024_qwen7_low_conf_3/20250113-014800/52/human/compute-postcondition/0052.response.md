The code `e1 -= 1` decrements the value of `e1` by 1. Initially, `e1` is equal to `n - 1`. After decrementing, `e1` will be `n - 2`.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `e1` is `n - 2`

The rest of the variables and their states remain the same as the initial state provided.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`
