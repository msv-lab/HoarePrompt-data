The code calculates the value of `sum2` based on the indices `s1`, `e2`, `e1`, and `s2`. The values of these indices are 1, `m-2`, `n-2`, and 1 respectively. 

Given the expressions for `s1`, `e2`, `e1`, and `s2`:
- `s1` is 1
- `e2` is `m - 2`
- `e1` is `n - 2`
- `s2` is 1

So, `sum2` is calculated as:
\[ sum2 = abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1]) \]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])), `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])**
