`s1` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of `sum1`, `sum2`, and `d` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables (`arr1`, `arr2`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1-1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `s1` is `s1 + 1`**
