`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means `t` will now hold the value entered as an integer. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`) are not yet defined and will be input later. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not yet defined**
