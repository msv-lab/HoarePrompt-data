The code updates `sum1` to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`. Given the initial conditions, `s1` is 1 and `s2` is 1, while `e1` is `n - 2` and `e2` is `m - 2`. Therefore, `sum1` becomes `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `arr2` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `cases` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]))`, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])**, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`.
