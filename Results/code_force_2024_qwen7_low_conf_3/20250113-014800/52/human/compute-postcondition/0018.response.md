The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The initial state of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `diff` is provided, but the actual values of these variables are not specified. The only change made by this code is to the variable `a`.

Since the input line is not specified, let's denote the input as a sequence of space-separated integers. Let's call this sequence `input_sequence`. After the code executes, `a` will be assigned the list of integers derived from `input_sequence`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an integer from the first input, `m` is an integer from the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the input sequence, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `n`, `diff` is undefined**
