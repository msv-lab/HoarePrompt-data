The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. Instead, it likely takes parameters through other means such as global variables or arguments passed from the calling context. However, based on the given constraints and relationships, we can infer the necessary inputs.

The function should handle test cases where:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^4\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor\).
- The array `a` is a list of \(2n\) integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.

Given this information, the function's behavior can be described as follows:

The function `func` processes `t` test cases. Each test case includes integers `n`, `k`, and an array `a` of \(2n\) integers. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts test cases defined by `t`, where for each test case it processes integers `n`, `k`, and an array `a` of \(2n\) integers, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
