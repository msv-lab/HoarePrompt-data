The code initializes a list `occ` with zeros, where the length of the list is `n + 1`. However, the value of `n` is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. Since `n` is not mentioned before this line, we can infer that `n` should be related to the length of the list `a`, which is derived from splitting and converting input strings to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `k` is twice the input integer `t`, i.e., `k = 2 * t`
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting input strings to integers

Let's assume the length of the list `a` is `len(a)`. Therefore, the list `occ` is initialized to `[0] * (len(a) + 1)`.

Since the value of `len(a)` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact length of `occ`. However, we know that `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `k` is \(2 * t\); `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting input strings to integers; `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`.**
