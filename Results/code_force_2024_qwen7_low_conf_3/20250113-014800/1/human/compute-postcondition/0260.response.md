`v` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `v` was `v_prev + 1`, so the new value of `v` is now `(v_prev + 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `g1` is not empty, `v` is `v_prev + 2`, `k` is greater than `v_prev + 1`, `output` contains the string representation of `x` appended to the previous content.

Output State: **`g1` is not empty, `v` is `v_prev + 2`, `k` is greater than `v_prev + 1`, `output` contains the string representation of `x` appended to the previous content.**
