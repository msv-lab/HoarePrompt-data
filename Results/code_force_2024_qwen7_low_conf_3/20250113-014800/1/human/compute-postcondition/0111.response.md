The code initializes three empty lists `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`. This means that `g0` is now an empty list, `g1` remains unchanged, and `g2` is also an empty list. The other variables (`a`, `occ`, `v`, `output`, `g1`, `n`, `k`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where `occ[x]` is the count of `x` in `a`, `v` is the original value of `v`, `output` is a list containing the string representations of the elements from `g1` and the formatted string representation of `x` (if any), joined by spaces, `g1` remains unchanged, `g0` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `k` is `2 * k`.**
