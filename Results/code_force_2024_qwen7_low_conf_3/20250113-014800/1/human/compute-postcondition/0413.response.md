`res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`. The code appends `ai` to `res1`. Therefore, the new list `res1` will contain `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`.

Output State: **`hp` is `wp + 2`, `cnts` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is 2, `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`**
