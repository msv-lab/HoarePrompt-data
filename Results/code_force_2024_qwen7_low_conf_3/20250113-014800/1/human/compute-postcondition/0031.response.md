The code appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. From the initial state, `i` is equal to `n + 1`. Since no specific value for `n` is given, we keep it as `n` in the expression. Therefore, `g0` will now contain the value `n + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \); `k` is \( 2 * t \); `a` is a list of integers; `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`; the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`; `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed); `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`; `g0` is an empty list with the appended value `n + 1`; `g1` contains the value of `i` if `occ[i] == 1`, and is empty otherwise; `g2` is empty if `occ[i] == 1`, and contains the value of `i` if `occ[i] != 1`; `n` is a positive integer and at least 1; `i` is `n + 1`.**
