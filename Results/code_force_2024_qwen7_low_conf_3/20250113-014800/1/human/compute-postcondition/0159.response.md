Postcondition: ***`v` is either the same as or incremented from its original value, `output` contains the string representation of the original value of `v` before the increment plus the string representation of `x`, `k` is an integer, and `g1` must still have elements left to iterate over. If `v < k`, then `v` is a value 1 greater than its original value, and `output` includes the string representation of `x`. Otherwise, `v` remains unchanged and `output` still contains the string representation of the original value of `v` before the increment.***
