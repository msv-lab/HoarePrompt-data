The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the code does not specify a loop or any conditional logic that would be affected by the `continue` statement, the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is a non-negative integer,
- `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged,
- `wanted_pairs` is 0,
- `wp` is 0,
- `found` is `True`,
- `ws` is `k`.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter any variables or affect the conditions given, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is 0, `wp` is 0, `found` is `True`, `ws` is `k`.**
