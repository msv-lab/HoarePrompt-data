`v` is incremented by 1, but the exact initial value of `v` is not specified. The values of `g1` and `output` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `g1` contains one fewer element than before the last iteration; `output` contains the string representation of `x`; `v` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`g1` contains one fewer element than before the last iteration; `output` contains the string representation of `x`; `v` is increased by 1**
