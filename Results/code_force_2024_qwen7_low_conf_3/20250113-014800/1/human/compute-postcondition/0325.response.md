Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once.
- `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once.
- `found` is `False`.
- `ws` is `0`.
- `wp` is `0`.
- `hs`, `res1`, `res2`, `hp`, `cnts2`, `half`, and `half2` retain their original values.

### For Loop:
```
for wanted_singles in range(k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for wanted_singles in range(k + 1)` will execute as long as `k + 1` is a positive integer.
2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `wanted_singles` is an iterator that takes values from `0` to `k`.
   - `k` is a variable that needs to be defined and should be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.

### Required Adjustments:
- Since `k` is used to define the range for the loop, `k` must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute. If `k` were negative, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.
- There is no direct dependency on the other variables (`singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, `wp`, etc.) for the loop to execute. However, these variables might change within the loop body, but they don't affect the loop's initial condition.

### Final State:
- `k` must be a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0) for the loop to execute.
- All other variables (`singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, `wp`, `hs`, `res1`, `res2`, `hp`, `cnts2`, `half`, and `half2`) remain as they are because they don't affect the loop's initial condition.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`k` must be a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0)**
