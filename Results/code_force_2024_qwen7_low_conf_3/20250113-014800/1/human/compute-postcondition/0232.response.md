Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described, and `a` is a list of integers from the input.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over integers from 1 to `n`. For each integer `i` in this range, the loop checks the value of `occ[i]` and appends `i` to the appropriate list (`g0`, `g1`, or `g2`).
- **Completion of Loop**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` and then stops.
- **Lists `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`**:
  - `g0` will contain all integers `i` for which `occ[i]` is 0.
  - `g1` will contain all integers `i` for which `occ[i]` is 1.
  - `g2` will contain all integers `i` for which `occ[i]` is greater than 1.
- **List `occ`**: This list remains unchanged and still holds the count of occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
- **Variables `v`, `g0`, `g1`, `output`, `a`, and `occ`**: These variables retain their original values (or their final state after the loop completes), as no further modifications are specified in the loop code.

Thus, the final state after the loop has executed all iterations is as described above.
