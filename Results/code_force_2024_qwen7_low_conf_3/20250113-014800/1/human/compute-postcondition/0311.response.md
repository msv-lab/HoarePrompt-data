`pairs` is assigned the value of `pairs + 1`. Since `pairs` was initially 0 (as it is not defined in the initial state and assuming it is initialized to 0 before this line of code), it becomes 1 after this line of code runs. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is an integer, and `cnt` is not equal to 1; `pairs` is 1**
