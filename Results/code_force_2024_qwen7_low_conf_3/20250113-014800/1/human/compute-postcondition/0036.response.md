Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `k` is \(2 * t\); `a` is a list of integers; `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`; the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`; `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed); `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`; `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`; `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`; `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`; `n` is the final value of the loop counter, which is `len(a)` if the loop executed, and is 1 if the loop does not execute; `i` is `len(a) + 1` if the loop executed, and is 1 if the loop does not execute.**
