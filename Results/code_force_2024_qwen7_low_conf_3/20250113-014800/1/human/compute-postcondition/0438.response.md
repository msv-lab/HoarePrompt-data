`res2` has its fourth element appended with the value of `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp + 3` or `wp + 5 if cnt == 2`, `cnt` is the next value in `cnts2`, `res2` is a list with five elements: the original element, the next key in `cnts2`, `ai`, `ai` again, and `ai` (the fourth element is appended).
