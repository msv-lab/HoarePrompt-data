The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `x` or `occ`. Since `a` must contain at least one element, we know that `occ` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `a` and values are their occurrences. The value of `occ[x]` will be incremented by 1, but the exact value before incrementation is unknown.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `occ[x]` is incremented by 1**
