To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0.
   - `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1.
   - `g2` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1.
   - `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
   - `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described.
   - `v` is `0`.
   - `output` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `g2`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in `g2`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `g2`, and `g2` contains elements `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `g2` is not empty.
   - The initial value of `i` being `n + 1` does not directly affect whether `g2` is empty or not, but it should be noted for completeness.

Given this, the key state to adjust is ensuring that `g2` is not empty.

**State:**
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0.
- `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1.
- `g2` must contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1.
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
- `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described.
- `v` is `0`.
- `output` is an empty list.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described, `v` is `0`, and `output` is an empty list.**
