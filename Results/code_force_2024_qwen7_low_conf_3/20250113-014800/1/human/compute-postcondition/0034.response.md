Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `k` is \( 2 * t \), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0` is an empty list if `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` contains the value `n + 1` if `occ[i] == 1`, and is empty otherwise, `g2` contains the value of `i` if `occ[i] != 1` and is empty otherwise, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, and `i` is `n + 1`.**
