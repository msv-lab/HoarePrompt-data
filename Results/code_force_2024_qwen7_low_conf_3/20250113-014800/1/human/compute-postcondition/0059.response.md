`output.append(f'{x}')` appends the string representation of `x` to the list `output`. Since the initial state mentions that `output` contains the string representation of `x`, this operation will add another string representation of `x` to the list. The values of `g1` and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` incremented by 1, and `output` is a list containing two elements: the first being the string representation of `x` and the second also being the string representation of `x`.**
