Postcondition: ***`v` is either the same as or incremented from its original value, `output` is a list containing the string representation of the original value of `v` before the increment plus the string representation of `x`, `k` is an integer, and `g1` must have at least one more element left to iterate over. If `v < k` is true, then `v` is incremented by 1.***
