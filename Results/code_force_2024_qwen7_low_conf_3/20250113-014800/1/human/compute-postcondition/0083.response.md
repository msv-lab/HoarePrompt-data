Output State: **`g0` is an iterable, `v` is either `k` (if the loop did not execute) or the original value of `v` plus 2 times the number of iterations (if the loop executed), and `output` is a list containing the string `'x x'` repeated `n` times where `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed.**
