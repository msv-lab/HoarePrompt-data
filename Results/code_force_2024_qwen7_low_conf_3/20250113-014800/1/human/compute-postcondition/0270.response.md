Postcondition: ***`v` is an integer, `output` is a list containing 'x x', `v` is incremented by 2, and `g0` must be a non-empty iterable. If the initial value of `v` is less than `k`, then these conditions hold. Otherwise, the conditions specified in the if part still apply since there is no else part to override them.***
