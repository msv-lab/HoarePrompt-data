The code initializes three empty lists `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, `occ`, `x`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the only change is the creation of these three new empty lists.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list.**
