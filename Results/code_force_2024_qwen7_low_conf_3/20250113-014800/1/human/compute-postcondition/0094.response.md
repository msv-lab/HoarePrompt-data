The code appends the formatted string representation of `x` to the list `output`. Initially, `output` is a list with three elements: the string representations of the first and the next element in `g1`, and the formatted string representation of `x`. After appending `f'{x}'` to `output`, the length of `output` increases by one, and its last element changes to `f'{x}'`.

Output State: **`v` is an integer less than `k` and less than `k` + 1, `output` is a list with four elements: the string representations of the first and the next element in `g1`, and the formatted string representation of `x`.**
