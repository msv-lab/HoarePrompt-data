`hp` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `hp` is `wp + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `wp + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp + 2`, `cnt` is the next value in `cnts2`, `res2` is a list with two elements: the original element and the next key in `cnts2`.**
