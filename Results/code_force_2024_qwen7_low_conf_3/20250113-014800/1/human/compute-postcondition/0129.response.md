`i` is assigned the value `n + 1`. According to the initial state, `n` must be greater than 0. The code appends `i` to the list `g0`. The initial state of `g0` is 1. After appending `i`, `g0` will contain both 1 and `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `g0` contains [1, `n + 1`], `g1` contains [1], `g2` contains the value 1**
