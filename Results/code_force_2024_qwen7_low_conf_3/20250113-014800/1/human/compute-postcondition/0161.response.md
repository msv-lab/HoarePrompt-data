`output.append(f'{x}')` appends the string representation of `x` to the list `output`. The value of `output` changes, but the specific value depends on the current value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is either the same as or incremented from its original value, `output` is a list containing the string representation of the original value of `v` before the increment plus the string representation of `x`, `k` is an integer, and `g1` must have at least one more element left to iterate over.**
