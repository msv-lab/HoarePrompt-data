`wp` is assigned the value of `wanted_pairs`. The value of `wanted_pairs` is `k >> 1`, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is `k >> 1`, `wp` is `k >> 1`, `found` is `True`, and `ws` is `wanted_singles`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is `k >> 1`, `wp` is `k >> 1`, `found` is `True`, and `ws` is `wanted_singles`**
