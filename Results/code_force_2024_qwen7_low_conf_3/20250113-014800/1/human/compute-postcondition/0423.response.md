`hp` is incremented by 1. The value of `wp` remains unchanged, `res1` remains a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, and `cnt` remains equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp` + 1, `cnt` equals 2.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp` + 1, `cnt` equals 2**
