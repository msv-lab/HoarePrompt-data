`g2` appends the value of `i` to itself. Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is a positive integer starting from 2. Therefore, `g2` changes from containing the value 1 to containing `[1, n + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `g0` contains the value 1, `g1` contains [1], `g2` contains [1, n + 1]**
