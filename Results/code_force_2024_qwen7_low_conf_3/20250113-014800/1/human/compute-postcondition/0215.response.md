`g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. Since `i` is currently 1, `g1` will now contain the value 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `occ[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `occ[i]` is equal to 1, and `g1` is a list containing `[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `occ[i]` is equal to 1, `g1` is [1]**
