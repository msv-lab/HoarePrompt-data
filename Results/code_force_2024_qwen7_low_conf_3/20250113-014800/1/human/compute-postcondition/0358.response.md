The `continue` statement in this context does not modify any of the variables; it simply skips to the next iteration of the loop or loop-like construct. Given that no changes are made to any variables, the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is `k >> 1`, `wp` is 0, `found` is `True`, `ws` is `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
