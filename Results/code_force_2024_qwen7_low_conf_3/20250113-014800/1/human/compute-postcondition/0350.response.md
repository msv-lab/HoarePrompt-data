The code `wp = wanted_pairs` assigns the value of `wanted_pairs` to `wp`. Given the initial conditions, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, and `wp` is also set to this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is now `wanted_singles`**
