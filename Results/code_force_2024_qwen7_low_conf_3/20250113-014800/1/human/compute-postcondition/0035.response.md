Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `k` is \(2 * t\); `a` is a list of integers; `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`; the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`; `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed); `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`; `g0` is an empty list if `occ[i] == 0`, otherwise it contains the value `n + 1`; `g1` contains the value `n + 1` if `occ[i] == 1`, and is empty otherwise; `g2` contains the value of `i` if `occ[i] != 1` and is empty otherwise; `n` is a positive integer and at least 1; `i` is `n + 1`.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else cases by summarizing the changes in the state of the program variables after executing the if-else block.
