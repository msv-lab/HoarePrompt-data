The code snippet `print(' '.join(map(str, res2)))` does not modify any of the variables. Instead, it prints the elements of `res2` separated by spaces. Since no variables are updated or modified, the values of `wp`, `res1`, and `hp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp + k` where `k` is the number of times `cnt == 2` in `cnts2`, and `res2` is a list containing all the `ai` values that were added to it, each value appearing twice if `cnt == 2`. The program prints the elements of `res2` separated by spaces.**
