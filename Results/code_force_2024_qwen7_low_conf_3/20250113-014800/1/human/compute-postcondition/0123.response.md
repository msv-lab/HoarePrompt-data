The code `g0.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `n`) to the list `g0`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `n` remains unchanged, but now `g0` includes the value `n`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `g0` is `[n]`, `g1` contains [1] or `g2` contains the value 1**
