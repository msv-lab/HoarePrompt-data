`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. Given that `occ[x]` was initially equal to 2, it will now be 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is `2*k - 1`, `g0` is in its original state, `g1` is in its original state, `output` contains pairs of elements from `g0` and the string representations of elements from `g1` up to the point where `v` would have reached `2*k - 1` and includes one additional pair, `a` must have at least one element, and `occ[x]` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `occ[x]` equal to 3.

Output State: **`v` is `2*k - 1`, `g0` is in its original state, `g1` is in its original state, `output` contains pairs of elements from `g0` and the string representations of elements from `g1` up to the point where `v` would have reached `2*k - 1` and includes one additional pair, `a` must have at least one element, and `occ[x]` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `occ[x]` equal to 3.**
