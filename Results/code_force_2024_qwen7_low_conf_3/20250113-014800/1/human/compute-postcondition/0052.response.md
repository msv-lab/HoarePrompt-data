Output State: **`v` is an integer less than or equal to `k`, `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v < k`, and `n` is the length of `a` if the loop executed, and is 1 if the loop does not execute.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `k` is \(2 * t\).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a` and its length is `len(a) + 1`.
   - `g2` is a non-empty list (there must be at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over elements in `g2`.
   - For each `x` in `g2`, if `v < k`, the string `f'{x} {x}'` is appended to `output`, and `v` is incremented by 2.

3. **Final Values:**
   - If the loop executes, `n` is the length of `a` because the loop counter `n` is updated to `len(a)` when the loop exits.
   - If the loop does not execute, `n` remains 1 because the loop counter `n` is initialized to 1 and not changed.
   - `v` will be an integer less than or equal to `k`. It starts at 0 and is incremented by 2 for each valid `x` in `g2` as long as `v < k`. Once `v` reaches or exceeds `k`, it stops incrementing, and `v` remains at `k`.

4. **Output List:**
   - `output` contains the string `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v < k` during the loop execution.

This output state accurately reflects the values of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished, considering both cases where the loop executes and where it does not.
