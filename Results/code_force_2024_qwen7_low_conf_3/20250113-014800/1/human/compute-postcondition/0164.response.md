Output State: **`v` is either the same as or incremented from its original value, `output` is a list containing the string representation of all elements in `g1` if `v` was incremented for each element, `k` is an integer, and `g1` is exhausted (i.e., has no more elements to iterate over). If `v` was not incremented for any element, `output` contains the string representation of the original value of `v` before the increment.**
