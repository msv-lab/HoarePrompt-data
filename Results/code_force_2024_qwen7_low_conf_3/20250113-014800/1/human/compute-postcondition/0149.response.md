Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`, `g1` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`, `g2` must contain at least one integer, `v` is `v + 4` if `v < k`, and `output` is a list containing one more element `f'{x} {x}' if `v < k`. Otherwise, `v` remains unchanged and `output` remains as a list containing one element `'x x'` if `v \ge k`.***
