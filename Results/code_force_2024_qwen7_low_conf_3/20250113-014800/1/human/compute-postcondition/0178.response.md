The code appends a formatted string `f'{x} {x}'` to the `output` list. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x`. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, `x` remains undefined, and the formatted string will be added to `output` as `f'{x} {x}'`.

Output State: **`v` is 0, `output` is ['f'{x} {x}']**, `k` is an integer, `g0` is not exhausted and contains at least one element
