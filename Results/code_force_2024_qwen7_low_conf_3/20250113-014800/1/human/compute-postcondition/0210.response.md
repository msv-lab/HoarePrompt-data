Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `v` is `2*k - 1`
- `g0` is in its original state (empty list)
- `g1` is in its original state (empty list)
- `output` contains pairs of elements from `g0` and the string representations of elements from `g1` up to the point where `v` would have reached `2*k - 1`
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each `occ[x]` equal to the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`
- `g0` is an empty list
- `g1` is an empty list
- `g2` is an empty list

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` must be `1`.

2. **Value of `n`:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Hence, `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted States:
- We need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop.
- We need to ensure that `n` is at least `1` for the loop to continue executing.

### Output:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
