The code snippet appends `ai` to the list `res1`. Initially, `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`. After appending `ai` to `res1`, the list `res1` will contain three elements: `ai`, `ai`, and another `ai`.

Output State: **`hp` is `wp + 2`, `cnts` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is 1, `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`**
