`g0` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `occ[i]` is 0 still holds. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `occ[i]` is 0; `g0` contains the value 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `occ[i]` is 0; `g0` contains the value 1**
