The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The `continue` statement itself does not affect any variable values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `wanted_singles` is greater than `singles`.**
