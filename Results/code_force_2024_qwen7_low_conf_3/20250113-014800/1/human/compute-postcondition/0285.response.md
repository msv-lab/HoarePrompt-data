According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `g1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `g1` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus one, and `output` is a list containing at least the string representation of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must still contain at least one element. The variable `v` and `output` will be updated within the loop, but since we don't have specific details about how they are updated, we only focus on `g1` to determine if the loop can continue.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must have at least one element.

State: **`g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus one, and `output` is a list containing at least the string representation of `x`**
