Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` is empty or contains no integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 2 * m`, where `m` is the number of times the loop has executed (and is either less than `k` or equal to `k`), and `output` is a list containing `m` elements of the form `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs until `g2` becomes empty because it iterates over `g2` and appends `f'{x} {x}'` to `output` and increments `v` by 2 each time `x` is processed.
- Once `g2` is empty, the loop stops executing.
- Each time the loop runs, it processes one element from `g2` and increments `v` by 2. Therefore, after `m` iterations, `v` will be `original_value_of_v + 2 * m`.
- If `v` is less than `k` after the loop finishes, `output` will contain `m` elements of the form `f'{x} {x}'`. If `v` is equal to or greater than `k`, `output` will be the list of elements processed so far.

Thus, the final output state is that `i` remains `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` and `g1` are unchanged, `g2` is empty, `occ` is the same list, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 2 * m`, and `output` is a list containing `m` elements `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`.
