`g1` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `i` is 3, `g1` will be a list containing the integer 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3; `n` is at least 1; `g1` is `[3]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is at least 1; `g1` is `[3]`**
