Output State: **`v` is either 0 or 2 (if `v` was incremented); `output` is a list containing pairs of elements from `g0` in the form `'x x'` and the string representations of all elements from `g1` up to the point where the loop did not execute or `v` reached `k`; `k` is an integer; `g0` is exhausted; `g1` is exhausted or contains no elements left to iterate over; if `v < k`, then `v` is either 1 or 3, otherwise `v` remains as per the initial state.**
