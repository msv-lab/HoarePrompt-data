The code initializes the variable `output` as an empty list. This means that the list `output` will no longer contain the string representations of all elements in `g1` if `v` was incremented for each element, as it did not contain anything before. The variable `v` remains unchanged at 0, and `k` remains an integer. The state of `g1` being exhausted is also not affected.

Output State: **`v` is 0, `output` is an empty list, `k` is an integer, and `g1` is exhausted.**
