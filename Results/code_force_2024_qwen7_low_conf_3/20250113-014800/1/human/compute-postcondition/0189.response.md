`v` is incremented by 1. Since `v` was initially either 0 or 2 (if `v` was incremented), incrementing `v` means it can now be 1 or 3. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`output` is a list containing pairs of elements from `g0` in the form `'x x'` and the additional string `f'{x}'`, `v` is 1 or 3, `k` is an integer, `g0` is exhausted, `g1` must not be exhausted and contains at least one element, and if `v < k`, then `v` is either 1 or 3, otherwise `v` remains as per the initial state.**
