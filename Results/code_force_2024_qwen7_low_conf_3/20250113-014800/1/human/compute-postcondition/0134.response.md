Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`, `g1` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`, `g2` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear more than 1 time in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each integer from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- If `occ[i]` is 0, the integer `i` is added to `g0`.
- If `occ[i]` is 1, the integer `i` is added to `g1`.
- If `occ[i]` is greater than 1, the integer `i` is added to `g2`.

Since the loop runs from 1 to `n` and processes each integer exactly once, after all iterations, `g0` will contain all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`, `g1` will contain all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`, and `g2` will contain all integers from 1 to `n` that appear more than 1 time in `a`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), then:
- `i` will be 1.
- `n` will be 0.
- `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` will all be empty lists.

However, the problem specifies that the output state includes what is true for the loop to execute at least that number of times, so we focus on the general case where the loop completes all its iterations.
