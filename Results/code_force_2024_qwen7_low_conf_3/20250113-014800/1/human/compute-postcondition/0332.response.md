The code snippet shifts the bits of `k - wanted_singles` right by 1, which is equivalent to dividing the result by 2 and discarding the remainder. This operation effectively calculates the integer division of `k - wanted_singles` by 2.

Let's denote the expression `k - wanted_singles` as `N`. The code snippet performs `N >> 1`, which means `wanted_pairs = N // 2`.

Given the condition `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged if the condition is true, and since no changes occur if the condition is false, we can summarize the impact:

- If `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` is true, `wanted_pairs` is set to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.
- If `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` is false, `wanted_pairs` is set to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, which is equivalent to `k - wanted_singles` shifted right by 1 bit.

In both cases, the value of `wanted_pairs` is `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, and `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.**
