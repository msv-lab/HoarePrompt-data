Postcondition: ***`hp` is `wp + 1`, `cnts` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is 2, `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`. Since the if condition `hp == wp` is checked and neither the if nor else part changes these variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
