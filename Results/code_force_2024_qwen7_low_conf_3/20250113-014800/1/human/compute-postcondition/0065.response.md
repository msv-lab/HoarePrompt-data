Postcondition: ***`g1` has at least one element. If `v` is less than `k` incremented by 3, then `output` is a list containing three elements: the first two being the string representation of the next element in `g1`, and the third being the string representation of `x`. Otherwise, `output` remains a list containing two elements: both being the string representation of the next element in `g1`.***
