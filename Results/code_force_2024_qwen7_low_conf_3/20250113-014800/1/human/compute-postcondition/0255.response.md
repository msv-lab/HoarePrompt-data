`output.append(f'{x}')` appends the string representation of `x` to the list `output`. The initial state tells us that `output` contains the string representation of `x`, so appending `f'{x}'` to `output` means that `output` will now contain both the existing string and the new string.

Output State: **`g1` must not be empty, `v` is incremented by 1 (so v is now v_prev + 1), `k` is greater than v (so k is greater than v_prev + 1), `output` contains the string representations of both the existing content and the new string `f'{x}'`.**
