`pairs` is incremented by 1, and the value of `cnt` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is an integer that is the count of the next number in `cnts`; `pairs` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`cnt` is an integer that is the count of the next number in `cnts`; `pairs` is increased by 1**
