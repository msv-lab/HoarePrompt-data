Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - If `occ[i]` is 0, then `g0` contains the value 1.
   - If `occ[i]` is 1, then either `g1` contains [1] or `g2` contains the value 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n + 1)`, meaning it starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop just ended, `i` was set to its maximum value during the last iteration, which is `n`.

4. **Next Iteration Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` was already `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the condition `i < n + 1` is no longer satisfied, so the loop will not execute again.

However, if we assume the problem is asking for the state before the loop ends (i.e., right before the condition is checked), the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` is `n`
- `n` remains the same and is still greater than 0.
- The values of `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` depend on the value of `occ[i]`, but since `i` is `n` and we don't know the exact value of `occ[n]`, these states remain as they were.

Thus, the state just before the loop ends and checks the condition would be:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, if `occ[i]` is 0, then `g0` contains the value 1, if `occ[i]` is 1, then either `g1` contains [1] or `g2` contains the value 1**
