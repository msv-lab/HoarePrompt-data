According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1 and at most 5000 (inclusive).

Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer and the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), we need to ensure that `t` falls within this range for the loop to execute.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop requires `t` to be a positive integer because the `range(t)` function generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
2. Additionally, since the problem specifies \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `t` must satisfy this condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these requirements.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)**
