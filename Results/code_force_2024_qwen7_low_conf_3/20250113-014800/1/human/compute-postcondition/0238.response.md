`v` is incremented by 2, changing its value from a value less than `k` to a value equal to the original value of `v` plus 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 2`, `output` is a list with one additional element `f'{x} {x}'`, and the current value of `v` is less than `k`.**
