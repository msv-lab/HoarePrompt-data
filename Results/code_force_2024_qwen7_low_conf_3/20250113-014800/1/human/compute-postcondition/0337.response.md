The variable `ws` is assigned the value of `wanted_singles`. No other variables are affected. The condition `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, and `wanted_pairs` is still equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`. The variable `found` remains `True`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles`**
