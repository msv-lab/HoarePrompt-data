`singles` is assigned the value `singles + 1`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged since it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is an integer that is the count of the next number in `cnts`; `singles` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`cnt` is an integer that is the count of the next number in `cnts`; `singles` is increased by 1**
