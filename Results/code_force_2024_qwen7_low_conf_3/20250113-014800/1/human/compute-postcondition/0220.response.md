Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is at least 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n + 1)`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will start from `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

4. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the condition `i < n + 1` will hold true if `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (which it already is).
   - The next value of `i` will be 2.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the next iteration of the loop.

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 1**
