The code `print(' '.join(output))` prints the elements of the list `output` joined by a space. This does not change the values of the variables `g1`, `v`, or `k`, nor does it modify the list `output`. It only outputs the contents of `output` in a specific format.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional action of printing the joined output.

Output State: **`g1` is an iterable, `v` is a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to `k`, and `output` is a list of strings where each string is of the form `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g1` such that `v < k`. After executing the code, the console prints the elements of `output` joined by a space.**
