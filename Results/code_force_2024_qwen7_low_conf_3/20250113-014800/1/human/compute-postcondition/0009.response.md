The code increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. Given the initial state, `occ[x]` was initially set to 1, so now it will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`, `x` is the second element of `a`, `occ[x]` is 2**
