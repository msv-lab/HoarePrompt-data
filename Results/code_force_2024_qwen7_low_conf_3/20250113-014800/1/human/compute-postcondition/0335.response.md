Postcondition: ***`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, and `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`. If `wanted_pairs` is greater than `pairs`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, no change occurs in the values of `k`, `wanted_singles`, and `wanted_pairs`.***
