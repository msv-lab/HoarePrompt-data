The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `t` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `a` and the unchanged values of `t` and `k`.

Since the initial state defines `t` as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `k` is twice the input integer `k`, we know the following:

- `t` remains an input integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `k` remains twice the value of the input integer `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is twice the input integer `k`, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting input strings to integers.**
