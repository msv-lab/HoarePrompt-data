`res1.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res1`. Initially, `res1` contains the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`. After appending `ai`, `res1` will contain four elements, all being `ai`. The values of the other variables (`hp`, `wp`, `cnts`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hp` is `wp + 2`, `cnts` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is 1, `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`**
