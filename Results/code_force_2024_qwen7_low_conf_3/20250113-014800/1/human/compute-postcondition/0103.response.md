The code initializes a list `occ` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not directly affect the values of `v`, `output`, `g1`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `a`. The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is an integer less than `k` or equal to the original value of `v` plus 2 times the number of iterations the loop executed, `output` is a list containing the string representations of the elements from `g1` that were iterated over, with each element formatted as a string, and possibly the formatted string representation of `x` if the loop executed, `g1` remains unchanged, the console output is `' '.join(output)', `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `2 * k`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
