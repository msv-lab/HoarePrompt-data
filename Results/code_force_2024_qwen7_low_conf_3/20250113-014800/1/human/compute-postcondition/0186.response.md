Postcondition: ***`v` is either 0 or 2 (if `v` was incremented); `output` is a list containing pairs of elements from `g0` (each pair is 'x x'); `k` is an integer; `g0` is exhausted; `g1` must not be exhausted and must contain at least one element; if `v < k`, then `v` is either 1 or 3, and `output` includes the string `f'{x}'`. Otherwise, the values of `v` and `output` remain as per the initial state after the if condition check.***
