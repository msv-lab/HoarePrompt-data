`g2` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `occ` remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `occ[i]` is not 0, and `occ[i]` is not equal to 1; `g2` contains the value 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `occ[i]` is not 0, and `occ[i]` is not equal to 1; `g2` contains the value 1**
