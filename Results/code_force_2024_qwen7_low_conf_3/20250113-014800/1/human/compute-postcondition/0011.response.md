`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is the third element of the list `a`. The value of `occ[x]` was previously 0 (as it is initialized to a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`). After incrementing, `occ[x]` will now be 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`, `x` is the third element of `a`, `occ[x]` is 1**
