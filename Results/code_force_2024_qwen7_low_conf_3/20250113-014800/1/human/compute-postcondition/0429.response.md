Postcondition: ***`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp` + 1, `cnt` is the next value in `cnts2`, `res2` is a list with two elements: the original element and the next key in `cnts2`. If `hp == wp`, the function continues with the current state. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged.***
