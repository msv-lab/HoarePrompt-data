Postcondition: **`v` is an integer less than `k` + 1. If `v` is less than `k`, `v` is updated to be an integer less than `k` + 1 but greater than its original value, and `output` is a list with three elements: the string representations of the first and the next element in `g1`, and the formatted string representation of `x`. Since there is no else part, if `v` is not less than `k`, the values of `v` and `output` remain unchanged.**
