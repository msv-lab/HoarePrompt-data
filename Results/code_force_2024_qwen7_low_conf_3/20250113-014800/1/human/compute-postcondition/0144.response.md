The value of `v` is incremented by 2, changing its value from `v + 2` to `v + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`, `g1` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`, `g2` must contain at least one integer, `v` is `v + 4`, and `output` is a list containing two elements `'x x'`**
