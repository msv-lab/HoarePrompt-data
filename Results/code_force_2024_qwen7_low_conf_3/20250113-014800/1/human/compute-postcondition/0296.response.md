The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs that include:
- `t`, a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^4\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\).
- A list `a` consisting of \(2n\) integers where each integer from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly twice.

The function likely processes these inputs and returns a specific value or set of values based on the given conditions. However, since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t`, and for each test case, it processes integers `n` and `k` along with a list `a` of \(2n\) integers, where each integer from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly twice.**
