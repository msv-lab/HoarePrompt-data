The given code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` does not define or initialize the variables, it only appends a formatted string to the list `output`. Since no initial values are provided for `x` or `output`, we cannot determine the exact state after the code is executed. However, we can describe the effect of the code on the variables.

The output list `output` will have one additional element, which is a string formatted as `'x x'` (assuming `x` is the value it holds at the time of execution). The variable `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`output` is a list with one additional element `'x x'`, `x` is unchanged**
