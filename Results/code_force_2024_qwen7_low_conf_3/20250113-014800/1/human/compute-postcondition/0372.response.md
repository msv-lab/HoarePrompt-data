Postcondition: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once, `found` is `True`, `ws` is the last valid `wanted_singles`, `wp` is the corresponding `wanted_pairs` such that \((k - wanted_singles) \% 2 == 0\) and `wanted_pairs <= pairs`, `res1` is an empty list, `res2` is an empty list, `hs` is 0, the original values of `half`, `half2`, `ws`, `wp`, `res2`, `cnts2` remain unchanged, `half` must contain at least one element. If `hs` is equal to `ws`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current count of `ai` in `cnts` is 1.**
