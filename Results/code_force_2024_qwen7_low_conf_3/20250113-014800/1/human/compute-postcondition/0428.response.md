The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block containing the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp` + 1, `cnt` is the next value in `cnts2`, `res2` is a list with two elements: the original element and the next key in `cnts2`**
