To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze what is required for the loop condition to be met.

### Given Information:
- `i` is `n + 1`: This means `i` starts from `n + 1`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0.
- `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1.
- `g2` is empty or contains no integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1.
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`.
- `v` is `original_value_of_v + 2 * m`, where `m` is the number of times the loop has executed (and is either less than `k` or equal to `k`).
- `output` is a list containing `m` elements of the form `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over elements in `g1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `g1` must contain at least one element.

### Analysis:
- Since `g1` contains integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, the loop will only execute if there exists at least one `i` where `occ[i] == 1`.
- The value of `i` starting from `n + 1` does not directly affect the contents of `g1` since `g1` is based on the values within `occ`.

### Necessary Adjustments:
For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `g1` is not empty. Specifically, there must be at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.

### State Adjustment:
- Ensure that `g1` is not empty.
- `i` and `n` do not directly affect the contents of `g1`, so they do not need to be adjusted explicitly.
- The value of `v` and `output` are derived from the loop and do not affect the initial state needed for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`g1` must not be empty**.

This ensures that the loop will execute as it requires at least one element in `g1` to iterate over.
