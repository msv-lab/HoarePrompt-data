The code initializes an empty list named `output`. No changes are made to the existing variables `i`, `n`, `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, `occ`, or `v`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described, `v` is `0`, and `output` is an empty list.**
