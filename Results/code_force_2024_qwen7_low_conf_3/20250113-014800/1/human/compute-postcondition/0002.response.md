The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged because it was not involved in the code execution.

- The value of `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers inputted by the user.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer.**
