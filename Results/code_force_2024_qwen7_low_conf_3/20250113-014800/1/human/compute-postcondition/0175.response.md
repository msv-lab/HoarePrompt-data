`v` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to 2. The value of `output`, `k`, `g0`, and the error due to the undefined variable `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `v` is 2, `output` is an empty list, `k` is an integer, `g0` is not exhausted and contains at least one element, and there is an error due to the undefined variable `x`.

Output State: **`v` is 2, `output` is an empty list, `k` is an integer, `g0` is not exhausted and contains at least one element, and there is an error due to the undefined variable `x`**
