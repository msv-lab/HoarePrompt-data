The code snippet `wanted_pairs = k - wanted_singles >> 1` impacts the `wanted_pairs` variable by assigning it a new value based on the current value of `k` and `wanted_singles`. The right shift operator `>>` divides the number by 2 and discards the remainder.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged.
- `wanted_pairs` is 0.
- `wp` is 0.
- `found` is `True`.
- `ws` is `k`.
- If `wanted_singles` is greater than `singles`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

Let's calculate the new value of `wanted_pairs`:
- `wanted_pairs = k - wanted_singles >> 1`

Since `wanted_singles` is initially 0, the equation simplifies to:
- `wanted_pairs = k >> 1`

So, the new value of `wanted_pairs` is `k >> 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is `k >> 1`, `wp` is 0, `found` is `True`, `ws` is `k`. If `wanted_singles` is greater than `singles`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
