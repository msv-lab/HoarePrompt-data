Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a list where `occ[x]` is the count of `x` in `a`.
- `v` is the original value of `v`.
- `output` is a list containing the string representations of the elements from `g1` and the formatted string representation of `x` (if any), joined by spaces.
- `g1` remains unchanged.
- `g0` is an empty list.
- `g2` is an empty list.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `k` is `2 * k`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i <= n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be within the range `[1, n]` for the loop to execute successfully.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop condition `i < n + 1` implies that `n` must be a positive integer.
   - If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute because the condition `i < n + 1` will never be satisfied.

3. **Other Variables (`a`, `occ`, `v`, `output`, `g1`, `g0`, `g2`, `k`):**
   - These variables do not directly affect the loop condition. They remain unchanged or their initial states do not influence whether the loop runs.

### Conclusion:
The only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` and `i`.

- `i` should start at 1 and increment until `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

Therefore, the modified states are:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
