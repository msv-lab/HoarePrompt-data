Output State: **`g1` is an iterable, `v` is either an integer that is at most `k` or an integer that is exactly `k` (if the loop did not execute), and `output` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `g1` if `v` is at most `k`, otherwise, `output` remains as the initial list.**
