`v` is incremented by 2. Since `v` was originally `original_value_of_v + 4`, the new value of `v` is `(original_value_of_v + 4) + 2`, which simplifies to `original_value_of_v + 6`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`output` has one additional element `f'{x} {x}'`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` must still contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 6`.**
