The `continue` statement in this context simply skips to the next iteration of a loop without changing the values of any variables. Given that no variables are modified by the `continue` statement and the precondition that `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, the output state will include all the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is 0, `wp` is 0, `found` is `True`, `ws` is `k`**
