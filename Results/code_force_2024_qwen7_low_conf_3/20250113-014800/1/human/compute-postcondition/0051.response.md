Postcondition: ***`v` is an integer less than `k`, `output` is a list that has one additional element `'x x'` compared to the previous iteration. If `v` remains less than `k` after being incremented by 2, then `v` is now an integer less than `k + 2`; otherwise, `v` is still less than `k` as there is no further change in `v` due to the absence of the else part.***
