`res2` is appended with the value of `ai`. The previous value of `res2` was a list with one additional element `ai` appended to it. Therefore, the new list `res2` now contains two elements: the original element and the new `ai`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp` + 1, `cnt` equals 2, `res2` is a list with two elements: the original element and `ai`.**
