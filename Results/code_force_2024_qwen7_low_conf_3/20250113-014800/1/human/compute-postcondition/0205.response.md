The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. Given the initial state, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `occ[x]` is specifically set to 1 for some `x`. This means that `occ[x]` was initially 1, and now it will be incremented by 1, making `occ[x]` equal to 2.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `v` is still `2*k - 1`.
- `g0` and `g1` remain in their original states.
- `output` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `occ[x]`.
- `a` must have at least two elements.
- `occ` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros, but now `occ[x]` is 2 instead of 1.

Output State: **`v` is `2*k - 1`, `g0` is in its original state, `g1` is in its original state, `output` contains pairs of elements from `g0` and the string representations of elements from `g1` up to the point where `v` would have reached `2*k - 1`, `a` must have at least two elements, and `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `occ[x]` equal to 2.**
