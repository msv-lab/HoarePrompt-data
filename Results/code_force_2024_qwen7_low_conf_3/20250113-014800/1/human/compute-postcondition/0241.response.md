The code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a new string to the `output` list. This string is formatted as `f'{x} {x}'`, meaning it contains the value of `x` repeated twice.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0
- `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1
- `g2` must contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`
- `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described
- `v` is `original_value_of_v + 2` (and is either less than `k` or equal to `k`)
- `output` is a list with one additional element `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`

Since the code only modifies the `output` list by appending a new element, the output state after running this code is:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` remains a non-negative integer
- `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` remain as described
- `occ` remains unchanged
- `v` remains `original_value_of_v + 2` (either less than `k` or equal to `k`)
- `output` now contains one additional element `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 2` (and is either less than `k` or equal to `k`), `output` is a list with one additional element `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`.**
