According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- Based on the value of `occ[i]` (which is 0 since `i` is equal to `n`), we adjust the states accordingly.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `occ[i]` is 0, then:
     - `g0` contains the value 1,
     - `g1` contains [1],
     - `g2` contains the value 1.

Since `i` is now equal to `n`, the loop will check if `i + 1` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n + 1`. Since `i` is already `n`, `i + 1` would be `n + 1`, which is out of the range `1` to `n`.

Therefore, the loop will not execute again because the condition `i < n + 1` will fail when `i` equals `n`.

However, if we assume the loop needs to continue for the sake of understanding the state transition, let's proceed:

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `n` and the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become `n + 1`.
   - But `i + 1` would exceed the range, so the loop will not execute again.
   
Given the above reasoning, the states do not change because the loop does not execute again. 

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `g0` contains the value 1, `g1` contains [1], `g2` contains the value 1**.

This final state reflects the condition where `i` exceeds the upper bound of the loop, and the loop will not execute further iterations.
