The given Python code initializes an empty list `output`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, `v`). Therefore, the only change is that `output` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`, `g1` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`, `g2` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear more than 1 time in `a`, `v` is 0, `output` is an empty list**
