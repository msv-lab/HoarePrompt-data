`wanted_pairs` is updated to the value of `k - wanted_singles >> 1`. Given the initial condition that `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, and the fact that `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`, we can infer that the new value of `wanted_pairs` will also satisfy this condition because the right shift operation (`>> 1`) effectively divides the value by 2 and shifts any remainder.

Since `wanted_pairs` is now defined as `k - wanted_singles >> 1`, and given the initial condition, the output state should reflect this new value for `wanted_pairs`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is now `wanted_singles + 1`.**
