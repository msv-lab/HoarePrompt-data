The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. The variable `x` is not specified in the initial state, but since `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `x` must be an index within this range. The value of `occ[x]` before this operation is 0 (as it is initialized to zero), so after the operation, `occ[x]` will be 1.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state:
- `v` is `2*k - 1`
- `g0` is in its original state
- `g1` is in its original state
- `output` contains pairs of elements from `g0` and the string representations of elements from `g1` up to the point where `v` would have reached `2*k - 1`
- `a` must have at least one element
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, with the value at index `x` now being 1.

Output State: **`v` is `2*k - 1`, `g0` is in its original state, `g1` is in its original state, `output` contains pairs of elements from `g0` and the string representations of elements from `g1` up to the point where `v` would have reached `2*k - 1`, `a` must have at least one element, and `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `occ[x]` equal to 1.**
