`g1` is a list that contains the value 1. The code appends `i` to `g1`. Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2 (since the smallest value `n` can take is 1, making `i` equal to 2). After appending `i` to `g1`, the list `g1` will contain `[1, i]` which is `[1, n + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `g0` contains the value 1, `g1` contains `[1, n + 1]`, `g2` contains the value 1**
