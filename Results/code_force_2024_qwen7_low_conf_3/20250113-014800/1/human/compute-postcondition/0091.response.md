`v` is incremented by 1. Since `v` was an integer less than `k` + 1, after incrementing, `v` is now an integer that is less than `k` + 1 but greater than its original value. The values of `k` and `output` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is an integer less than `k` + 1 but greater than its original value; `k` is an integer; `output` is a list with three elements: the string representations of the first and the next element in `g1`, and the formatted string representation of `x`.**
