`cnts2` is assigned a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in `half2`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tc` is `n-1`, `hs` is equal to `ws`, `res1` is a list of elements `[ai, ai]` for each key-value pair in `cnts` where `cnt` == 2, `res2` is a list of all elements added in the loop, `hp` is equal to the number of elements in `res2`, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `found` is `True` if all elements in `half` have `cnt` == 2 and `hs` equals `ws` at the end of the loop, otherwise `found` is `False`, `cnts2` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `half2`, `half` is the first `tc + 1` elements of `a`, `half2` is the slice of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `cnts` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `half`.**
