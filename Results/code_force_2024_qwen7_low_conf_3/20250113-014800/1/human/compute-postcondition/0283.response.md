`v` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `v` is less than `k`. The value of `g1`, `output`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus one, `output` is a list containing at least the string representation of `x`.**
