Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists as described, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 4` (and is either less than `k` or equal to `k`), and `output` is a list with one additional element `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`***.

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we assume no changes occur outside the if part. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains consistent with the if part's postcondition.
