The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. The initial state includes `wp`, `res1`, `hp`, `cnt`, and `res2`.

- `res2` is a list with two elements: the original element and the next key in `cnts2`.
- The code appends `ai` to `res2`.

Therefore, the updated list `res2` will now contain three elements: the original element, the next key in `cnts2`, and `ai`.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp + 2`, `cnt` is the next value in `cnts2`, `res2` is a list with three elements: the original element, the next key in `cnts2`, and `ai`.**
