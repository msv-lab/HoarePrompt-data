To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0
- `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1
- `g2` is empty or contains no integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`
- `v` is `original_value_of_v + 2 * m`, where `m` is the number of times the loop has executed (and is either less than `k` or equal to `k`)
- `output` is a list containing `m` elements of the form `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`

### Loop Code:
```
for x in g1:
    if v < k:
        output.append(f'{x}')
        v += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in `g1` (integers `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`). For each iteration, if `v < k`, it appends the string representation of `x` to `output` and increments `v` by 1.
2. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `g1` and `v < k`.

### Output State After Loop Executes Some Number of Times:
- **After 1 Iteration**:
  - `g1` must not be empty
  - `v` is incremented by 1
  - `k` is greater than `v`
  - `output` contains the string representation of `x`

- **After 2 Iterations**:
  - `g1` must not be empty
  - `v` is incremented by 1 (`v` is now `v_prev + 1`)
  - `k` is greater than `v` (so `k` is greater than `v_prev + 1`)
  - `output` contains the string representation of `x` appended to the previous content if `v < k`

- **After 3 Iterations**:
  - `g1` is not empty
  - `v` is either `v_prev + 2` or `v_prev + 1`
  - `k` is greater than `v_prev + 1`
  - `output` contains the string representation of `x` appended to the previous content if `v < k`

### Final Output State:
- **Final Values**:
  - `g1` will be empty after the loop terminates since it processes each element exactly once.
  - `v` will be the maximum value it could reach without exceeding `k`. It will be `v = original_value_of_v + 2 * len(g1)` if `len(g1) <= k - original_value_of_v`.
  - `output` will contain the string representations of all elements in `g1` up to the point where `v >= k`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will continue to process elements in `g1` until `v` reaches or exceeds `k`. Once `v` is no longer less than `k`, the loop will terminate.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`g1` is empty, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 2 * len(g1)` if `len(g1) <= k - original_value_of_v`, otherwise `v` is `k`, `output` contains the string representations of all elements in `g1` up to the point where `v >= k`.**
