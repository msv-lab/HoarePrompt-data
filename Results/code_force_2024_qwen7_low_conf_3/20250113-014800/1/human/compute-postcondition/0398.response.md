`hp` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `hp` is equal to `wp`, so `hp` becomes `wp + 1`. The states of the other variables (`cnts` and `cnt`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hp` is `wp + 1`, `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` equals 2.

Output State: **`hp` is `wp + 1`, `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` equals 2**
