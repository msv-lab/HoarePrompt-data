Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `hp` is `wp + 1`
   - `cnts` must have at least two key-value pairs
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (ai, cnt) in cnts.items():
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are key-value pairs in `cnts`.
   - Since `cnt` is currently 1, the condition `cnt == 2` is not met, and no changes occur to `hp` or `res1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `hp` remains `wp + 1` because no changes are made when `cnt` is 1.
   - `cnts` must still have at least two key-value pairs for the loop to continue.
   - `cnt` will increment by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `res1` will be updated to a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`hp` is `wp + 1`, `cnts` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is 2, `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`**
