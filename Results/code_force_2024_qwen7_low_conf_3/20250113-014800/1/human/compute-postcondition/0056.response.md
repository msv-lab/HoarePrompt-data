`v` is incremented by 1, changing its value from a value less than `k` to a new value. The value of `g1` and `output` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` incremented by 1, and `output` contains the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` incremented by 1, and `output` contains the string representation of `x`.**
