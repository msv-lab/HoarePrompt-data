`found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The value of `found` does not depend on the values of `k`, `wanted_singles`, or `wanted_pairs`, so these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, and `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`; `found` is `True`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, and `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`; `found` is `True`**
