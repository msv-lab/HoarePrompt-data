The value of `v` is incremented by 2, starting from a value less than `k`. Therefore, the new value of `v` is `v + 2`, which is still less than `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`output` is ['x x'], `v` is `v + 2`, `g0` must be a non-empty iterable, and the current value of `v` is less than `k`.**
