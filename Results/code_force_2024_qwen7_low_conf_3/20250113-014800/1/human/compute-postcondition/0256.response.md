`v` is incremented by 1, which means `v` is now `v_prev + 1`. The other variables (`g1`, `k`, and `output`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`g1` must not be empty, `v` is `v_prev + 1`, `k` is greater than `v_prev + 1`, `output` contains the string representations of both the existing content and the new string `f'{x}'`.**
