Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` may contain the value of `i` but is empty if `occ[i] == 0`, `g2` is a list containing `i` if `occ[i] != 1` and is empty otherwise, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `occ[i]` is 0 if the condition `occ[i] == 0` was met in the if part, and `occ[i]` is not equal to 1 if it did not meet the condition `occ[i] == 1` in the if part.***
