The code appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. Since `g1` could previously contain either `[1]` or `1` depending on the value of `occ[i]`, it now includes the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, if `occ[i]` is 0, then `g0` contains the value 1, if `occ[i]` is 1, then `g1` contains `[1, i]` or `g2` contains the value 1**
