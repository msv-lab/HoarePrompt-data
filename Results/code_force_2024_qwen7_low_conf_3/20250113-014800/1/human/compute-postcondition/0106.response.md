According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must contain at least one element, and `occ[x]` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element. Since we are entering the next iteration, it implies that `a` still contains at least one element. Therefore, no changes are needed for `a`.

However, since `occ[x]` was incremented by 1 in the last iteration, the value of `occ[x]` will now be incremented by 1 again.

State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `occ[x]` is incremented by 1 again**
