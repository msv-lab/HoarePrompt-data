The code `output.append(f'{x}')` appends the string representation of `x` to the list `output`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of the variables involved. Since `output` is a list and it is not specified whether it initially contains any elements or what `x` holds, we can only state that `x` is appended to `output` as a string.

Given the initial state where `g1` has at least one element and `v` is a value less than `k`, and all other variables retain their states from the precondition, the output state will be:

- `g1` has at least one element (unchanged).
- `v` is a value less than `k` (unchanged).
- `x` is appended to `output` as a string.

Output State: **`g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k`, `output` is a list containing at least the string representation of `x`.**
