The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1, where `x` is the first element of the list `a`. The value of `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is twice the value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`, and `x` is the first element of `a`.

After executing the line `occ[x] += 1`, the value of `occ[x]` will be 1 (since it was initialized as 0 and incremented by 1). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`, `x` is the first element of `a`, `occ[x]` is 1**
