According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` must contain at least one element, and `occ[x]` is incremented by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element, and `occ[x]` will be incremented by 2 again.

However, since the loop condition only checks if `a` contains at least one element, and there's no information about the specific value of `x` or any changes to `a`, we can only focus on the condition for the loop to continue.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
