The initial value of `hp` is defined as `wp + len(res1) / 2`. The code sets `hp` to 0, which directly changes its value. The values of `wp`, `res1`, and `cnts` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is 0, `cnts` is a dictionary of key-value pairs where each value is either 1 or 2.**
