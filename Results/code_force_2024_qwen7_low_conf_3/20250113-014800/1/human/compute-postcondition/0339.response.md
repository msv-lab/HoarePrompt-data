The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; instead, it breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block. However, since no loops or conditionals are specified in the given code, the only impact is the breaking out of any potential loop or conditional context that might have been present. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no other operations are performed, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
