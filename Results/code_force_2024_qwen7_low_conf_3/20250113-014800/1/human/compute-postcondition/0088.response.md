Postcondition: ***`v` is an integer less than `k` + 1; `k` is an integer; `output` is a list with one element, which is the string representation of `x`.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part provided, the overall postcondition directly adopts the postcondition from the if part. The precondition remains unchanged, and the only relevant information about the `output` list is that it has one element, which is the string representation of `x`.
