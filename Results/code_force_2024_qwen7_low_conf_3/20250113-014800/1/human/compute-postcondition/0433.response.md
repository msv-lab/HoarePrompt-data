Postcondition: ***`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp + 2`, `cnt` is the next value in `cnts2`, `res2` is a list with four elements: the original element, the next key in `cnts2`, `ai`, and `ai` again. If `cnt == 2`, `hp` is updated to `wp + 2`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
