The code `g0.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. Since the initial state of `g0` is an empty list, appending `i` means `g0` now contains `[i]`.

- The value of `t` is unchanged.
- The value of `k` is unchanged since it is defined as `2 * t`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The list `occ` remains unchanged.
- The variable `x` remains unchanged since no assignment is made to it.
- The value of `occ[x]` remains unchanged.
- The list `g1` remains unchanged.
- The list `g2` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0` is now `[i]`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `occ[i]` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0` is now `[i]`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `occ[i]` is 0**.
