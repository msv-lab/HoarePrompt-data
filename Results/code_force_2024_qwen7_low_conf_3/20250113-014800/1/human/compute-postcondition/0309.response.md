`singles` is assigned the value `singles + 1`. Since the initial value of `singles` is not specified, let's assume it is `0` (a common default). The value of `cnt` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the value of `singles` becomes `1`.

Output State: **`cnt` is currently equal to 1, `singles` is equal to 1**
