Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`, `g1` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`, `g2` must contain at least one integer, `v` is `v + 2`, and `output` is now a list containing one element `'x x'` if `v < k`. Otherwise, the original state of `i`, `n`, `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, `v`, and `output` remains unchanged.***
