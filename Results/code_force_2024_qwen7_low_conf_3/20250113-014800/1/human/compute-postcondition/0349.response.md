`ws` is reassigned the value of `wanted_singles`. The value of `wanted_singles` remains the same, so `ws` is now equal to `wanted_singles`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is now `wanted_singles`**
