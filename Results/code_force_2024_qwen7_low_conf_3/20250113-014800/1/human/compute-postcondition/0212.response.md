`g0.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. Since `i` is currently 1, the list `g0` will now contain the element 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `occ[i]` is 0 also remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `occ[i]` is 0, `g0` is [1]**
