The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Since `g2` was previously empty, after this line, `g2` will contain the value of `i`.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the next step, but since we are only focusing on the immediate effect of the given code, the output state after executing `g2.append(i)` is:

Output State: **`g2` contains the value of `i`; `g0` is an empty list; `g1` may contain the value of `i` but is empty if `occ[i] == 0`; `g2` now contains the value of `i`; `k` is `2 * t`; `a` is a list of integers; `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`; `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed); `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`; `n` is a positive integer and at least 1.**
