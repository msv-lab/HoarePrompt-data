The code `res1 = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `res1`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `res1` and retains the values of all other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once, `found` is `True`, `ws` is the last valid `wanted_singles`, `wp` is the corresponding `wanted_pairs` such that `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 0` and `wanted_pairs <= pairs`, `res1` is an empty list, and the original values of `hs`, `res2`, `hp`, `cnts2`, `half`, and `half2` remain unchanged.**
