The code `print(' '.join(output))` does not change any variables. It simply joins the elements of the list `output` into a single string with spaces between each element and then prints this string. The list `output` remains unchanged, and the variable `v` and the iterable `g1` also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`g1` is an iterable, `v` is either an integer that is at most `k` or an integer that is exactly `k` (if the loop did not execute), and `output` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `g1` if `v` is at most `k`, otherwise, `output` remains as the initial list.**
