`res2` appends the value of `ai` to itself. The value of `ai` is the next element in `half`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, `wp`, and `res1` is updated by appending `ai`. The original values of `half`, `half2`, `ws`, `wp`, `res2`, and `cnts2` remain unchanged, and `hs` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ai` is the next element in `half`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, `wp`, `res1` is updated by appending `ai`, `res2` contains the elements of `res2` before appending `ai` plus `ai`, `ws`, `wp`, `half`, `half2`, `res2`, `cnts2`, and `hs` is increased by 1.**
