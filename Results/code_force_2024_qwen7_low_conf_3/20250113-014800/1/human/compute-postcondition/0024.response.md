To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and the conditions of the loop.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( t \) is an input integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \)
- \( k = 2 * t \)
- \( a \) is a list of integers
- \( occ \) is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in \( a \); the length of \( occ \) is \( len(a) + 1 \)
- \( x \) is any element in \( a \) (if the loop executed)
- \( occ[x] \) is the count of occurrences of \( x \) in \( a \)
- \( g0 \) is an empty list
- \( g1 \) may contain the value of \( i \) but is empty if \( occ[i] == 0 \)
- \( g2 \) is a list containing \( i \) if \( occ[i] \neq 1 \) and is empty otherwise
- \( n \) is a positive integer and at least 1
- \( occ[i] \) is 0 if the condition \( occ[i] == 0 \) was met in the if part, and \( occ[i] \) is not equal to 1 if it did not meet the condition \( occ[i] == 1 \) in the if part.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n`.
2. **Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) was some integer within the range from `1` to `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- \( i \) must be incremented by 1.
- Since the loop iterates over a range starting from `1` to `n`, the next valid value for \( i \) would be the current value of \( i \) plus 1.

### Adjusted States:

- **\( t \)**: Remains unchanged as \( t \) is determined by the initial input and does not change during the loop iterations.
- **\( k \)**: Remains unchanged as \( k = 2 * t \) and does not depend on \( i \).
- **\( a \)**: Remains unchanged as the list \( a \) does not get modified in the loop.
- **\( occ \)**: Remains unchanged as the list \( occ \) does not get modified in the loop.
- **\( x \)**: Remains unchanged as \( x \) is set to some element in \( a \) only when the loop executes.
- **\( g0 \)**: Remains unchanged as \( g0 \) is empty and does not get updated based on \( i \).
- **\( g1 \)**: Remains unchanged or becomes empty if the condition \( occ[i] == 0 \) is met.
- **\( g2 \)**: Remains unchanged or contains the current value of \( i \) if the condition \( occ[i] \neq 1 \) is met.
- **\( n \)**: Remains unchanged as \( n \) is a constant defined before the loop.
- **\( i \)**: Incremented by 1.

### Final State:
- \( t \) remains the same.
- \( k \) remains the same.
- \( a \) remains the same.
- \( occ \) remains the same.
- \( x \) remains the same.
- \( g0 \) remains empty.
- \( g1 \) is either empty or may contain the new value of \( i \) if the condition \( occ[i] == 0 \) was met.
- \( g2 \) is either empty or contains the new value of \( i \) if the condition \( occ[i] \neq 1 \) was not met.
- \( n \) remains the same.
- \( i \) is incremented by 1.

### State Adjustment:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), \( k \) is \( 2 * t \), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` may contain the value of `i` but is empty if `occ[i] == 0`, `g2` is a list containing `i` if `occ[i] != 1` and is empty otherwise, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1.**
