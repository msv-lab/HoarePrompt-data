Postcondition: ***`k` is a non-negative integer; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is the last valid `wanted_singles` for the next element; `wp` is the corresponding `wanted_pairs` for the next element such that \((k - wanted_singles) \% 2 == 0\) and `wanted_pairs <= pairs`; `res1` is a list containing `ai`; `res2` is a list containing the element `ai` appended from the previous iteration if `cnts[ai] == 1` was true; `hs` is 1 (if `cnts[ai] == 1`); the original values of `half`, `half2`, `ws`, `wp`, `res2`, `cnts2` remain unchanged; either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or nothing changes since there is no else part.***
