The code `continue` is used in a loop to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, and `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`. The current value of `wanted_pairs` is greater than `pairs`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
