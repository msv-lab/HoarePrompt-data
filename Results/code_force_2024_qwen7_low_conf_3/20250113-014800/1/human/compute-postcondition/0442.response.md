The given code snippet is printing the elements of `res1` using `print(' '.join(map(str, res1)))`. This operation does not change any of the values of the variables. It only prints the contents of `res1`.

Since the values of `wp`, `hp`, `res1`, and `res2` remain unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp + k` where `k` is the number of times `cnt == 2` in `cnts2`, and `res2` is a list containing all the `ai` values that were added to it, each value appearing twice if `cnt == 2`.**
