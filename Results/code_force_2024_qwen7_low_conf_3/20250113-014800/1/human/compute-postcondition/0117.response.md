`g1` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 1. The value of `i` remains 1, `n` remains greater than 0, and `occ[i]` remains not 0 (specifically, it remains 1). Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `occ[i]` is 1, and `g1` contains `[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `occ[i]` is 1, `g1` contains [1]**
