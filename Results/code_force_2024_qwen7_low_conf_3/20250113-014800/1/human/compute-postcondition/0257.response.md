Postcondition: ***`g1` must not be empty, `v` is incremented by 1 (`v` is now `v_prev + 1`), `k` is greater than `v` (so `k` is greater than `v_prev + 1`), and `output` contains the string representation of `x`. If `v < k`, `output` is updated to contain the string representations of the existing content and the new string `f'{x}'`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
