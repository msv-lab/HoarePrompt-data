Postcondition: ***`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, and `hp` equals `wp`. Since `hp == wp` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. There is no change to `cnts2` as there is no else part provided and the condition to modify it does not arise.***
