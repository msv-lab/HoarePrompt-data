`singles` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged, so `singles` is incremented by 1 only if `cnt` was previously equal to 1, and `pairs` remains unchanged as `cnt` is not checked for being greater than 1 in this line of code.

Output State: **`cnt` is the count of the next number in `cnts`, `singles` is incremented by 1, and `pairs` remains unchanged.**
