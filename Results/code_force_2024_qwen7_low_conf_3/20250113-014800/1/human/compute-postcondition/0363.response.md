The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Given that there is no loop or conditional block in the provided code, the only impact is that the execution will exit the current block. However, since no specific block is mentioned, we assume this is part of a larger context where the `break` statement would typically exit a loop or condition. Since no such block is present here, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is `k >> 1`, `wp` is `k >> 1`, `found` is `True`, and `ws` is `wanted_singles`**
