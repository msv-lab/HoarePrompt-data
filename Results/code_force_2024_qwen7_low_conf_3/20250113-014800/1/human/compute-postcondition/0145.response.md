Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`, `g1` contains all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`, `g2` must contain at least one integer, `v` is either `v + 4` (if `v < k`) or unchanged (`v + 2`), and `output` is a list containing two elements `'x x'` if `v < k` and unchanged as a list containing one element `'x x'` if `v >= k`.***
