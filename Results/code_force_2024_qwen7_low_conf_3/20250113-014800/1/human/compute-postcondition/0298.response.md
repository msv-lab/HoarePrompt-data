`n` and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`. The values of `tc`, `hs`, `ws`, `res1`, `res2`, `hp`, `wp`, `found`, and `cnts2` remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`tc` is `n-1`, `hs` is equal to `ws`, `res1` is a list of elements `[ai, ai]` for each key-value pair in `cnts` where `cnt == 2`, `res2` is a list of all elements added in the loop, `hp` is equal to the number of elements in `res2`, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `found` is `True` if all elements in `half` have `cnt == 2` and `hs` equals `ws` at the end of the loop, otherwise `found` is `False`, and `cnts2` is an empty dictionary; `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
