`v` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `v` is less than `k` incremented by 1, so the new value of `v` is the original value of `v` plus 1. The values of `g1` and `output` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` incremented by 2, and `output` is a list containing two elements: the first being the string representation of `x` and the second also being the string representation of `x`.**
