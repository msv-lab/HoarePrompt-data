According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `g1`. The loop will execute as long as `g1` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `g1` must not be empty, `v` is incremented by 1, `k` is greater than `v`, and `output` contains the string representation of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must still not be empty. Additionally, since `v` is incremented by 1, `v` will be incremented from its previous value. Let's denote the previous value of `v` as `v_prev`. Therefore, `v` will now be `v_prev + 1`.

Since `k` must be greater than `v` after the increment, `k` must be greater than `v_prev + 1`.

State: **`g1` must not be empty, `v` is incremented by 1 (so v is now v_prev + 1), `k` is greater than v (so k is greater than v_prev + 1), and `output` contains the string representation of x.**
