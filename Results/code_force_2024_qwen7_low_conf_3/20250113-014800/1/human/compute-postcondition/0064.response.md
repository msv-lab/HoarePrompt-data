`v` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `v` is less than `k` incremented by 2, so the new value of `v` is less than `k` incremented by 3. The states of the other variables (`g1`, `output`) are not affected.

Output State: **`g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` incremented by 3, and `output` is a list containing three elements: the first two being the string representation of the next element in `g1`, and the third being the string representation of `x`.**
