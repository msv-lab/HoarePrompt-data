The code appends a formatted string `f'{x} {x}'` to the list `output`. Given the initial state, `output` contains two elements: `'x x'` and `'x x'`. The value of `x` in these strings is less than `k`.

After appending `f'{x} {x}'`, the list `output` will contain three elements: `'x x'`, `'x x'`, and `'x x'`. The value of `x` remains unchanged because the value of `x` is determined by the existing elements in `output`, and the append operation does not modify `x`.

Therefore, the updated state of `output` is:

Output State: **`output` contains the elements `'x x'`, `'x x'`, and `'x x'` where `x` is a value less than `k`.**
