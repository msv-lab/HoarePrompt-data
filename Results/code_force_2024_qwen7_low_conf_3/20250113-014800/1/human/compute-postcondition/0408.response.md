Postcondition: ***`hp` is `wp + 1`, `cnts` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is 1, `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`. If `cnt` equals 2, then `hp` is updated to `wp + 2` and `res1` is updated to a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`, `ai`, `ai`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
