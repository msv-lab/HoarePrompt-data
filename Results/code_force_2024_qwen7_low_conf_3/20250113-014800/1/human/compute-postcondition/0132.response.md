Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `g0` contains the value 1, `g1` contains either `[1, n + 1]` or `[1]`, `g2` contains either `[1, n + 1]` or the value 1. If `occ[i] == 1`, then `g1` contains `[1, n + 1]` and `g2` contains `[1, n + 1]`. Otherwise, `g1` remains as `[1]` and `g2` contains `[1, n + 1]`.*
