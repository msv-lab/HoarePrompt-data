The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to. Given the lack of context, we can assume it is part of a loop structure. Since the `continue` statement itself does not modify any variables, the values of the variables before and after the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `wanted_singles` is greater than `singles`, and the current value of `k` satisfies ((k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1)**
