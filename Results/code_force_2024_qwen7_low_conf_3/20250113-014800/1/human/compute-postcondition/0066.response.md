Output State: **`g1` is an iterable, `v` is a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to `k`, and `output` is a list of strings where each string is of the form `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g1` such that `v < k`. If `v` is not less than `k` after all iterations, `output` will contain the strings corresponding to the elements of `g1` up to the point where `v` reaches `k`.**
