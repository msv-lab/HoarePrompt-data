`g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Since `i` is equal to `n` (from the initial state), `g2` will now contain the value `n`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `occ`, `g0`, and `g1`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `g0` contains the value 1 if `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains [1] if `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` contains `[n]`**
