The code `g0.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. The previous value of `i` is incremented by 1, but its exact value was not specified initially. However, we know that `i` was incremented by 1 after this line of code. Since `g0` was initially empty, after appending `i`, `g0` now contains the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `k` is \( 2 * t \), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0` contains the value of `i`, `g1` may contain the value of `i` but is empty if `occ[i] == 0`, `g2` is a list containing `i` if `occ[i] != 1` and is empty otherwise, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1.**
