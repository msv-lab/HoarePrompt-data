The code `res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. The initial state shows that `res2` is a list with three elements: the original element, the next key in `cnts2`, and `ai`. After appending `ai` to `res2`, the list `res2` will now have four elements.

The values of the other variables (`wp`, `res1`, `hp`, `cnt`, and `cnts2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp + 2`, `cnt` is the next value in `cnts2`, `res2` is a list with four elements: the original element, the next key in `cnts2`, `ai`, and `ai` again.**
