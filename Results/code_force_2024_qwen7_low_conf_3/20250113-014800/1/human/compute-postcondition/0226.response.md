According to the given for loop, the loop condition is based on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `n` must still satisfy the condition of being at least 1.

Let's summarize the updated states:

- `i` must be 3.
- `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3 and `n` is at least 1**
