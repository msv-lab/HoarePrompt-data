`res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. However, the value of `ai` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unspecified. The other variables (`wp`, `res1`, `hp`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`wp` is the initial value, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `hp` is `wp` + 1, `cnt` equals 2, `res2` is a list with one additional element `ai` appended to it.**
