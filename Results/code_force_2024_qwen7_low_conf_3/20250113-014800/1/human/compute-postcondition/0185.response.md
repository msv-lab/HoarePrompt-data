The value of `v` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `v` is either 0 or 2, incrementing by 1 will make `v` either 1 or 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is either 1 or 3; `output` is a list containing pairs of elements from `g0` (each pair is 'x x') plus the string `f'{x}'`; `k` is an integer; `g0` is exhausted; `g1` must not be exhausted and must contain at least one element; the current value of `v` is less than `k`**
