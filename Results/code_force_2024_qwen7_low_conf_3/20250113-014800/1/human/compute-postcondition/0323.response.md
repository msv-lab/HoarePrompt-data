`ws` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `ws` is now 0, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once, `found` is `False`, `ws` is `0`, `hs`, `res1`, `res2`, `hp`, `wp`, `cnts2`, `half`, and `half2` retain their original values.
