The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, it just continues the loop.

Given the initial conditions and the fact that no variables are being modified or reassigned by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`, `wp` is now `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is now `wanted_singles + 1`**
