Postcondition: ***`v` is 0, `output` is an empty list, `k` is an integer, `g0` is not exhausted and contains at least one element. If `v < k`, there is an error due to the undefined variable `x`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition if the condition `v < k` is not met.***
