The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is inside. In this case, it breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block. The conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is now `wanted_singles`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
