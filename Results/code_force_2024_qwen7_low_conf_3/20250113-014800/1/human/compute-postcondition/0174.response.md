The code appends a string in the format `'x x'` to the list `output`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the given initial state, and there is no assignment to `x` before the append operation. Therefore, `x` remains undefined, and the append operation will result in an error if `x` is not defined elsewhere in the context.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `x` is not defined, which means the code will raise an error. However, following the instructions to provide the output state:

Output State: **`v` is 0, `output` is an empty list, `k` is an integer, `g0` is not exhausted and contains at least one element, and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `x`**.
