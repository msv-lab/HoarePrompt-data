`g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `g2`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `occ[i]`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `occ[i]` is not 0 and is not equal to 1, and `g2` contains the value 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `occ[i]` is not 0 and is not equal to 1, `g2` contains the value 1**
