The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, the `continue` statement itself does not modify any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`, `wp` is now `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is now `wanted_singles + 1`. If `wanted_singles > singles`, these conditions hold. Otherwise, no change occurs since there is no else part.**
