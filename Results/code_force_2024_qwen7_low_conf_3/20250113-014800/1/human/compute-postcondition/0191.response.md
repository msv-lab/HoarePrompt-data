Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `output` is a list containing pairs of elements from `g0` in the form `'x x'` and the additional string `f'{x}'`.
   - `v` is 1 or 3.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `g0` is exhausted.
   - `g1` must not be exhausted and contains at least one element.
   - If `v < k`, then `v` is either 1 or 3, otherwise `v` remains as per the initial state.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for x in g1:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop iterates over `g1`.
   - Since `g0` is exhausted and `g1` must not be exhausted, the loop can continue as long as `g1` has elements.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `output` remains unchanged since it does not depend on the current iteration of the loop.
   - `v` remains unchanged because the condition for changing `v` (`v < k`) is not specified to change during this loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `g1` must not be exhausted, and it must contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

5. **New State:**
   - After one iteration of the loop, `g1` will have one fewer element than before.
   - Therefore, `g1` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`output` is a list containing pairs of elements from `g0` in the form `'x x'` and the additional string `f'{x}'`, `v` is 1 or 3, `k` is an integer, `g1` must not be exhausted and contains at least one element**.
