The code `g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. Since `g1` was initially empty, after this line, `g1` will contain the value of `i`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is an input integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \); `k` is \( 2 * t \); `a` is a list of integers; `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`; the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`; `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed); `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`; `g0` is an empty list; `g1` contains the value of `i`; `g2` is a list containing `i` if `occ[i] != 1` and is empty otherwise; `n` is a positive integer and at least 1; `i` is incremented by 1.**
