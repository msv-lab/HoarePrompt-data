Postcondition: ***`g1` has at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus one, and `output` is a list containing at least the string representation of `x`. If `v` is less than `k`, `output` will have at least two elements, both being the string representation of `x`. Otherwise, `output` remains unchanged.***
