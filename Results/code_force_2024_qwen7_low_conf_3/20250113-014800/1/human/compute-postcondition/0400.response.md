`res1.append(ai)` appends the element `ai` to the list `res1`. The initial state shows that `res1` is a list containing the element `ai`. After appending `ai` to `res1`, the list `res1` will now contain two elements: `ai` and another `ai`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`hp` is `wp + 1`, `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` equals 2, `res1` is a list containing the elements `ai`, `ai`**
