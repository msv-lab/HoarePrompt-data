Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a` and its length is `len(a) + 1`, `g2` is a non-empty list (there must be at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`), `n` is the final value of the loop counter, which is `len(a)` if the loop executed, and is 1 if the loop does not execute, `i` is `len(a) + 1` if the loop executed, and is 1 if the loop does not execute, `v` is 2 if `v < k`, otherwise `v` remains 0, and `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` is an empty list.***
