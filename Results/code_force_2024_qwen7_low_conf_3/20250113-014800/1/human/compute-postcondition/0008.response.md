Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `k` is \(2 * t\).
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`.
   - `x` is the first element of `a`.
   - `occ[x]` is 1.

2. **For Loop**: 
   ```python
   for x in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is the first element of `a`.
   - `occ[x]` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `x` becomes the next element in the list `a`.
   - Therefore, `x` will now be the second element of `a`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `k` remains \(2 * t\) as it is also not modified inside the loop.
   - `a` is still a list of integers with at least one element, but now `x` is the second element of `a`.
   - `occ` remains a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`, and `occ[x]` will be updated to 1 after this iteration.

7. **Final State for Next Iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `k` is \(2 * t\).
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `x` is the second element of `a`.
   - `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`, and `occ[x]` is 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `occ` is a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`, `x` is the second element of `a`, `occ[x]` is 1**
