Postcondition: ***`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is now `wanted_singles + 1`. Since the condition `wanted_pairs > pairs` is checked in the if part and no else part is provided, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition within the if block.***
