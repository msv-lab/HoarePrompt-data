`v` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `v` is the original value of `v` plus 1. The values of `g1`, `k`, `output`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g1` has at least two elements, `v` is the original value of `v` plus 1, `k` is unchanged, `output` is a list containing at least three elements, all being the string representation of `x`.**
