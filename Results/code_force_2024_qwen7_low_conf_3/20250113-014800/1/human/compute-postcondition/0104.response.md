Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `v` is an integer less than `k` or equal to the original value of `v` plus 2 times the number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `output` is a list containing the string representations of the elements from `g1` that were iterated over, with each element formatted as a string, and possibly the formatted string representation of `x` if the loop executed.
   - `g1` remains unchanged.
   - The console output is `' '.join(output)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is now `2 * k`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

2. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.
   - `k` changes to `2 * k` inside the loop, but we need to ensure the loop can start with the initial value of `k`.

Given this information, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- Since the loop depends on the elements of `a`, `a` must contain at least one element.
- `k` must be initialized properly, but since it is modified within the loop, we focus on ensuring `a` is non-empty.
- The other states (`v`, `output`, `g1`, `n`, and `occ`) are either not directly relevant to the loop's execution or remain unchanged.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
