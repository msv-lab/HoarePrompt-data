`pairs` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged, and `singles` and `cnts` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is the count of the next number in `cnts`, `singles` must be incremented if `cnt` equals 1, `pairs` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`cnt` is the count of the next number in `cnts`, `singles` must be incremented if `cnt` equals 1, `pairs` is incremented by 1**
