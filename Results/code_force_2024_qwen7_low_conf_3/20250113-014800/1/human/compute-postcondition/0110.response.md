Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Code Analysis:
```python
for x in a:
    occ[x] += 1
```
- **Variable `a`:** This is a list of integers.
- **Variable `occ`:** This is a list of `n + 1` zeros initially. After the loop, `occ[x]` will be incremented for each occurrence of `x` in `a`.

### Initial State:
- `v` is an integer less than `k` or equal to the original value of `v` plus 2 times the number of iterations the loop executed.
- `output` is a list containing the string representations of the elements from `g1` that were iterated over, with each element formatted as a string, and possibly the formatted string representation of `x` if the loop executed.
- `g1` remains unchanged.
- The console output is `' '.join(output)`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is now `2 * k`.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

### Loop Execution:
- For each element `x` in `a`, the corresponding index `x` in `occ` is incremented by 1.

### Final State Determination:
After the loop has executed, `occ` will contain the count of each integer in `a`. Specifically:
- `occ[x]` will be the number of times `x` appears in `a`.

Since the loop runs until all elements in `a` are processed, the final state will be:
- `a` is unchanged.
- `occ` contains the counts of each integer in `a`.
- `v` is the original value of `v` because the loop does not modify it.
- `output` is a list containing the string representations of the elements from `g1` (unchanged) and the formatted string representation of `x` (if any), joined by spaces.
- `g1` remains unchanged.
- The console output is `' '.join(output)`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` is doubled to `2 * k`.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:

**Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where `occ[x]` is the count of `x` in `a`, `v` is the original value of `v`, `output` is a list containing the string representations of the elements from `g1` and the formatted string representation of `x` (if any), joined by spaces, `g1` remains unchanged, `n` is the input integer, `k` is `2 * k`.**
