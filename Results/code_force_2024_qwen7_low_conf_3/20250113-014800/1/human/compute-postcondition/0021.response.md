The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Since `i` is not defined previously and no value is specified for it, `i` could be any integer. However, given the initial conditions, we know that `occ[i]` is not equal to 1, meaning `i` is not the count of any single element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the value of `i` is added to the list `g2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is a list containing `i`, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `occ[i]` is not equal to 1**
