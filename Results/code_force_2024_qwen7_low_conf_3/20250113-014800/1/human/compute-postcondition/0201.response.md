The code initializes a list `occ` with zeros, where the size of the list is `n + 1`. This means that each element in `occ` will be set to 0. The value of `n` is not specified, but it is assumed to be an integer. The variables `v`, `g0`, `g1`, `output`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the only change is that the list `occ` is now initialized to `[0] * (n + 1)`, which means it has `n + 1` elements, all set to 0.

Output State: **`v` is `2*k - 1`, `g0` is in its original state, `g1` is in its original state, `output` contains pairs of elements from `g0` and the string representations of elements from `g1` up to the point where `v` would have reached `2*k - 1`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, and `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
