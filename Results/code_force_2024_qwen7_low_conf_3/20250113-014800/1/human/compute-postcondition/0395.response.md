The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the execution simply ends here. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hp` is 0, `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, and the current value of `hp` is equal to `wp`.**
