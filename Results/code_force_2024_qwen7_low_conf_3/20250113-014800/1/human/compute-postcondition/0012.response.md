Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `k` is \(2 * t\), `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding integer in `a`, the length of `occ` is `len(a) + 1`, `x` is any element in `a` (if the loop executed), `occ[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For each element `x` in `a`, the corresponding index in the list `occ` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `occ[i]` for each `i` in `a` will hold the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `a` is an empty list), then `occ` remains a list of zeros with a length of `len(a) + 1`, which would still be 1 since `len(a)` is 0.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop executes is described as above.
