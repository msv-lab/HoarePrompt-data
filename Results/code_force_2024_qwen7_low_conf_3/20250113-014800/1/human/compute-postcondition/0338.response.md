The code assigns the value of `wanted_pairs` to `wp`. Since `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is also equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles`**
