Output State: **`hp` is `wp + len(res1) / 2`, `cnts` is a dictionary of key-value pairs where each value is either 1 or 2, `res1` is a list containing pairs of identical elements according to the dictionary `cnts`, `wp` is the initial value of `wp` and remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `hp` starts at 0.
   - `wp` is an initial value that remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `cnts` is a dictionary mapping keys (`ai`) to their counts (`cnt`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each key-value pair in `cnts`.
   - For each pair `(ai, cnt)`:
     - If `hp` equals `wp`, the loop breaks.
     - If `cnt` is 2, `hp` increases by 1, and `res1` appends `ai` twice.
     - If `cnt` is 1, no changes occur to `hp` or `res1`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - Since the loop increments `hp` by 1 for every key with a count of 2, the final value of `hp` will be `wp + (number of keys in `cnts` with count 2) / 2`.
   - `res1` will contain pairs of elements corresponding to keys in `cnts` with a count of 2.
   - `cnts` remains unchanged after the loop.
   - `wp` remains unchanged because it is never modified within the loop.

This ensures that the final state of the variables accurately reflects the operations performed by the loop.
