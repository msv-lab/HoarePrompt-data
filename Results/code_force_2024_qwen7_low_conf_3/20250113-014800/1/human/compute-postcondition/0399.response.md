The code `res1.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res1`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `ai`. Since `ai` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. The other variables `hp`, `wp`, `cnts`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `hp` is `wp + 1`; `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair; `cnt` equals 2; `res1` is a list that now contains the element `ai`.

Output State: **`hp` is `wp + 1`; `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair; `cnt` equals 2; `res1` is a list containing the element `ai`**
