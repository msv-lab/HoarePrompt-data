Postcondition: ***`ai` is the next element in `half`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, `wp`, `res1`, `res2`, and `hs` are updated based on the processing of the current `ai`, the original values of `half`, `half2`, `ws`, `wp`, `res2`, and `cnts2` remain unchanged, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or block when `hs == ws`, or continues without any specific change in the program state.***
