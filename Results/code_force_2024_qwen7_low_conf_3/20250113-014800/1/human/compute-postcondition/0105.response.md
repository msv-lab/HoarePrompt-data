`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `a` remains unchanged because no code directly affects it. However, the exact value of `occ[x]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its new value precisely without knowing the initial value of `occ[x]`. We only know that it has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `occ[x]` is incremented by 1**
