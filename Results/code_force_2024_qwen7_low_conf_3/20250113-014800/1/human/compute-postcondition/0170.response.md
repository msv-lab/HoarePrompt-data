`output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a formatted string containing the value of `x` twice to the list `output`. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. The initial state only mentions that `v` is 0, `output` is an empty list, `k` is an integer, `g0` is not exhausted and contains at least one element, and the value of `v` is less than `k`. Since the value of `x` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact content of the appended string.

Output State: **`v` is 0, `output` is ['x x'], `k` is an integer, `g0` is not exhausted and contains at least one element, and the value of `v` is less than `k`**
