The code appends the string representation of `x` to the list `output`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state. Since no specific value for `x` is given, we cannot determine the exact string that will be appended. But we know that `output` will be modified.

The initial state is:
- `g1` must not be empty
- `v` is less than `k`

After executing the code, `output` will contain the string representation of `x`. The values of `g1` and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g1` must not be empty, `v` is less than `k`, `output` contains the string representation of `x`**
