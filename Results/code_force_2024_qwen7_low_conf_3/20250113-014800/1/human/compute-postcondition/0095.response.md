`v` is incremented by 1. Initially, `v` is an integer less than `k` and less than `k + 1`. After incrementing `v` by 1, `v` is no longer less than `k`, but it is still less than `k + 1`. The other variables (`output`, `g1`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is an integer less than `k` + 1 and greater than or equal to `k`; `output` is a list with four elements: the string representations of the first and the next element in `g1`, and the formatted string representation of `x`; `g1` and `x` remain unchanged.**
