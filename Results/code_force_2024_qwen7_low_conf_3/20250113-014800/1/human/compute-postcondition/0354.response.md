Postcondition: ***`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is 0, `wp` is 0, `found` is `True`, `ws` is `k`. Since there is no else part in the code, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition when `wanted_singles > singles`.***
