Output State: **`v` is an integer less than `k` or equal to the original value of `v` plus 2 times the number of iterations the loop executed; `output` is a list containing the string representations of the elements from `g1` that were iterated over, with each element formatted as a string, and possibly the formatted string representation of `x` if the loop executed, and `g1` remains unchanged.**
