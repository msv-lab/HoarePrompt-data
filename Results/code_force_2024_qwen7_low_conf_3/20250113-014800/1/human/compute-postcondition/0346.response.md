The `continue` statement in this context simply skips to the next iteration of the loop without changing the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged, `wanted_pairs` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `wp` is now `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is now `wanted_singles + 1`**
