Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` must still contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 6`, and `output` has one additional element `f'{x} {x}'` if `v` is less than `k`**
