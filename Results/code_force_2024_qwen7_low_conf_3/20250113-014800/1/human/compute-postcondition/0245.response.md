The code snippet appends a string in the form `f'{x} {x}'` to the `output` list. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `x` or `v`. The only information we know is that `v` is `original_value_of_v + 4` and is either less than `k` or equal to `k`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact string that will be appended. But we can state that the `output` list will gain one additional element which is `f'{x} {x}'`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`output` has one additional element `f'{x} {x}'`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `g0` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 0, `g1` contains all integers `i` such that `occ[i]` is 1, `g2` must still contain at least one integer `i` such that `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `v` is `original_value_of_v + 4` (and is either less than `k` or equal to `k`).**
