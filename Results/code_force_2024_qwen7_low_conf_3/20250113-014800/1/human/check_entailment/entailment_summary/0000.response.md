Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding two subsets \(l\) and \(r\) of lengths \(2k\) each such that the bitwise XOR of elements in \(l\) equals the bitwise XOR of elements in \(r\).
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input values and processes each test case separately.
   - It correctly categorizes integers into groups \(g0\), \(g1\), and \(g2\) based on their occurrence counts.
   - The program attempts to construct subsets \(l\) and \(r\) by using elements from these groups.
   - Specifically, it prioritizes using pairs of elements from \(g2\) (since each element in \(g2\) appears more than once, and using both instances of an element helps balance the XOR sums).
   - If not enough elements are available in \(g2\), it uses single elements from \(g1\).
   - Finally, it prints the constructed subsets.

3. **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**:
   - The program ensures that the XOR conditions are met by constructing subsets primarily from elements that appear multiple times (group \(g2\)).
   - If \(k\) is large, it will use as many elements from \(g2\) as possible, and the remaining elements will come from \(g1\).
   - The program handles the case where \(g2\) or \(g1\) might be empty, which means it won't generate any output for such test cases.
   - The logic is sound in ensuring that the XOR conditions are satisfied and the subsets are of the required length.

4. **Execution Summary**: The provided execution summary matches the program's logic, indicating that the program behaves as expected.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
