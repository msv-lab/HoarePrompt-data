Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and initializes an array `occ` to count occurrences of each number from 1 to `n`.

2. **Grouping Numbers Based on Occurrences**: The program groups numbers into three lists:
   - `g0`: Contains numbers that occur 0 times.
   - `g1`: Contains numbers that occur once.
   - `g2`: Contains numbers that occur more than once.

3. **Constructing Output Arrays `l` and `r`**:
   - The program constructs the output arrays `l` and `r` by appending numbers from `g2` and `g1`. Specifically, it ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` will match.
     - For numbers with an even count in `g2`, it appends both instances of the number to both `l` and `r`.
     - For numbers with an odd count in `g2`, it appends one instance to `l` and the other to `r`.
     - It then adds numbers from `g1` to `l` and `r` alternately, ensuring the total length of `l` and `r` is `2k`.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The program generates and prints the arrays `l` and `r` for each test case. The construction method guarantees that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly generates valid arrays `l` and `r` that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
