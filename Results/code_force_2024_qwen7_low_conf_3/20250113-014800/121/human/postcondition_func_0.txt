The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and performs the following operations:

1. Determines if the number of set bits in `n` is odd. If it is, the function prints 'second'.
2. If the number of set bits is even, the function prints 'first' and then proceeds to transform `n` based on certain conditions.
   - It calculates a new value `l` derived from the binary representation of `n`.
   - It prints the result of `n XOR l` along with `l`.
3. After these operations, it enters a loop that continues until two consecutive inputs are equal. In each iteration of the loop, it updates `n` based on the parity of the set bits in the current value of `a`. It then repeats the process of calculating `l` and printing `n XOR l` and `l`.

The function does not return any explicit value. Instead, it outputs a sequence of integers and strings during its execution.
