The code `break` is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not affect these variables or their values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, and the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`.**
