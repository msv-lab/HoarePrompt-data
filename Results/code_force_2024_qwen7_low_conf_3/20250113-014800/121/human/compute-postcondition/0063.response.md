`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The value of `l` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not affect it. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the previous value of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of the last value of `n` back to an integer**
