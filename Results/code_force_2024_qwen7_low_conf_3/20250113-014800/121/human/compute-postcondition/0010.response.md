The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, splits the input into two parts, and converts them to integers. It then assigns these integers to `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `n` is an input integer. After running the code, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but `a` and `b` are assigned the integers read from input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
