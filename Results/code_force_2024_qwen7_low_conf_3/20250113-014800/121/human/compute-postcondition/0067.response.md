The code `print(n ^ l, l)` will print the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `l`, followed by the value of `l`. Since `l` is initially equal to `n`, the output will be the result of `n ^ n` (which is 0) followed by `l`.

Let's break this down:

- `n` is the integer value entered by the user.
- `l` is equal to `n`.
- The print statement will output `n ^ l` which is `n ^ n` (bitwise XOR of `n` with itself, resulting in 0), followed by the value of `l`.

Therefore, the output state will show that `n` and `l` retain their initial values (since they are not reassigned in the given code), but the print statement has been executed.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `l` is equal to `n`, and the output is 0 followed by `n`.**
