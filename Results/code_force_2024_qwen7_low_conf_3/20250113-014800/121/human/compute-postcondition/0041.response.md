Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer input from the user, `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of `n` back to an integer, `a` and `b` are the integers separated by a space from the input, and the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`***
