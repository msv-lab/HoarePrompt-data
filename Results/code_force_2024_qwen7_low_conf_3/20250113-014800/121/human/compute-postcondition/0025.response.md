The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of these inputs, we will keep the values of `a` and `b` as `input()` in the output state. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is 5, `l` is 0, `a` is `input()`, `b` is `input()`**
