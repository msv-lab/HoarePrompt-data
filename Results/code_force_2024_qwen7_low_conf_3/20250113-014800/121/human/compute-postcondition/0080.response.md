Postcondition: ***`a` is an input value, `b` is an input value, `n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, otherwise `n` is `a`. `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`. After executing the if-else block, `l` is determined based on the condition and `a` and `b` retain their input values unless the condition is met, in which case `n` is set to either `a` or `b`, and `l` is the integer representation of `n`'s binary form.***
