Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, otherwise `n` is `a`.
   - `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of the last value of `n` back to an integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)
   ```

3. This code converts the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix) to an integer. Specifically:
   - `bin(n)` converts `n` to its binary representation as a string starting with '0b'.
   - `bin(n)[3:]` removes the first two characters ('0b'), leaving only the binary digits.
   - `int(..., 2)` converts this binary string back to an integer with base 2.

4. The value of `n` remains unchanged by this operation, but `l` now holds the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` retains its original value (either `a` or `b` depending on the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a`).
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix).

Output State: **`n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, otherwise `n` is `a`; `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix)**.
