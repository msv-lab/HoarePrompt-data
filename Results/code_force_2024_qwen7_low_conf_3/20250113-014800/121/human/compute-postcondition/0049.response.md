The code `break` does not affect any variable values and merely breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since no such construct is present in the given code snippet, the variables `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values. 

Output State: **`n` is its original value, `l` is its original value, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement we were directly inside.**
