`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer**
