The code snippet performs a bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `l`, and then prints both `n ^ l` and `l`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is the integer value of `data[index]`
   - `b` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
   - `index` is updated to `index + 6`
   - `n` is `a`
   - `l` is `170`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `n ^ l` is calculated, which is `a ^ 170`.
   - `print(n ^ l, l)` prints the result of `a ^ 170` and `l`.

3. **Output:**
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `index` is updated to `index + 6`.
   - `n` is still `a`.
   - `l` remains `170`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `a` is the integer value of `data[index]`
   - `b` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
   - `index` is `index + 6`
   - `n` is `a`
   - `l` is `170`
   - The output printed is `a ^ 170` and `170`.

Output State: **`a` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `b` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 6`, `n` is `a`, `l` is `170`, and the output printed is `a ^ 170` and `170`.**
