Output State: **`a` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `b` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `n` is `b` if the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, else `n` is `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary number formed by the last 8 bits of `n`, and the print statement outputs `n ^ l` followed by `l` (where `l` is the integer value of the binary number formed by the last 8 bits of `n`).**
