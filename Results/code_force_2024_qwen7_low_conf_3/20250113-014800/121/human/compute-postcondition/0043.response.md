Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer input from the user, `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of `n` back to an integer, `a` and `b` are the integers separated by a space from the input. If `a` is equal to `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part, so the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `a == b` is not met.***
