Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of the last value of `n` back to an integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if `a == b`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.***
