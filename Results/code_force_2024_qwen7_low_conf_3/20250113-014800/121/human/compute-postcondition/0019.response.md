The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The printed values being `0` and `n` do not affect the variables themselves.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is either `a` or `b`, `l` is equal to `n`.**
