According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the condition is true, and it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Since there is no condition specified in the loop that depends on external variables, the loop will continue to execute as long as it is not manually exited.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is its original value and `l` is its original value. For the loop to execute one more time, no adjustments to these values are necessary because the loop will always continue to run due to the `while True` condition.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is its original value, `l` is its original value**
