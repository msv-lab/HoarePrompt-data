The code performs a bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `l`, and then prints the result along with the value of `l`. The values of `n` and `l` are 2 and 2 respectively.

- The bitwise XOR operation `n ^ l` between 2 and 2 results in 0 because `2` in binary is `10` and `2` in binary is `10`, and `10 XOR 10` equals `00`, which is `0` in decimal.
- After the operation, the value of `l` remains unchanged at 2.
- The print function outputs `0 2`.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `l` is 2, `a` is 7, `b` is 2 and the output is 0 2.**
