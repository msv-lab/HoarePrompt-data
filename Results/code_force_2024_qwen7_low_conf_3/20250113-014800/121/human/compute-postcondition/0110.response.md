The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the given constraints and output cases, it seems there might be an implicit understanding that the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers: `t` and `n`. 

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).

The output cases are not specified in the provided function signature, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case.

Given the structure and constraints, the function `func_1` likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n`. Since no specific output is mentioned other than the constraints, we can only describe the parameters and the expected behavior in terms of the input values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, where each test case contains two integers `t` and `n`, with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and returns a result for each test case based on the values of `t` and `n`.**
