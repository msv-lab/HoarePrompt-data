Postcondition: **`a` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `b` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, index is increased by 2, and the print output is `n ^ l` followed by `l`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the program continues with the current state. Since there is no else part, the program does nothing different if the condition is false.**
