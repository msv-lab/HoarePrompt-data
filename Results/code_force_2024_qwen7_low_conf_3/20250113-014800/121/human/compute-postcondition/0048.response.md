The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, converts them to integers, and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `a` and `b`. However, we know that `n` and `l` remain in their original states because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is its original value, `l` is its original value, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**
