Postcondition: **`a` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `b` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 6`, `n` is `b` if the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, else `n` is `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary number formed by the last 8 bits of `n`. Since the if condition `a == b` is checked, if `a` equals `b`, then `n` remains as `b`; otherwise, `n` remains as `a`. In either case, `l` is the integer value of the binary number formed by the last 8 bits of `n`.**
