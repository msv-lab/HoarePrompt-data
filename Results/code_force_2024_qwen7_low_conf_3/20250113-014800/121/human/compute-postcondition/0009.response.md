To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while True` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is an input integer

The loop condition is `True`, meaning the loop will continue indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Since the loop will always execute, no adjustments to the initial state are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer**
