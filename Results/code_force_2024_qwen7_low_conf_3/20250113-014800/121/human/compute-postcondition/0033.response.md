The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that `n` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user, while `t` and `l` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer input from the user, `l` is equal to `n`.**
