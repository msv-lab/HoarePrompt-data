Postcondition: ***`n` is its original value, `l` is its original value, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and if `a` equals `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement we were directly inside. Otherwise, no change in the variables `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b` and no further action is taken.***
