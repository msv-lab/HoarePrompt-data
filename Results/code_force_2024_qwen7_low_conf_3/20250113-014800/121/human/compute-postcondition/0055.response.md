The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the input is not specified in the initial state, let's assume the input is `7 2` (as mentioned in the printed values).

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state is: `n` is 5, `l` is 2.
2. The code reads two integers from the input and splits them into a list. For example, if the input is `7 2`, it will split this into a list `[7, 2]`.
3. The `map(int, ...)` function converts each element in the list to an integer. So, the list `[7, 2]` becomes the tuple `(7, 2)`.
4. The tuple `(7, 2)` is then unpacked into `a` and `b`, so `a` is assigned the value 7 and `b` is assigned the value 2.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `n` is 5
- `l` is 2
- `a` is 7
- `b` is 2

Output State: **`n` is 5, `l` is 2, `a` is 7, `b` is 2**
