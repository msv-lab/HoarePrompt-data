The code `print('second')` prints the string 'second' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `t` or `n`. Therefore, the only change is the printed output.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer with an odd number of 1s in its binary representation; the output is 'second'**
