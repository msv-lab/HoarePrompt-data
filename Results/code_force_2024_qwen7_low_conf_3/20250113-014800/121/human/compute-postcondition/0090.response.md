Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is an input value.
   - `b` is an input value.
   - `n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, otherwise `n` is `a`.
   - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` excluding the "0b" prefix.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `print(n ^ l, l)` performs two operations:
     - It calculates `n ^ l`, which is the bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `l`.
     - It prints the results of the above operation.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - Since the print statement does not reassign any values, the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial values.
   - The bitwise XOR operation `n ^ l` is calculated and printed, but this does not affect the values of `n` and `l`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The output of the print statement is the result of `n ^ l` followed by `l`.
   - The variables `a` and `b` retain their initial input values.
   - `n` remains either `a` or `b` based on the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a`.
   - `l` retains its value as the integer representation of `n` without the "0b" prefix.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is an input value, `b` is an input value, `n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, otherwise `n` is `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` excluding the "0b" prefix, and the output is `n ^ l` followed by `l`.**
