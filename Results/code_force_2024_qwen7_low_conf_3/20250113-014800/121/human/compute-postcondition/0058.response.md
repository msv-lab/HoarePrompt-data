First, let's analyze the code snippet:
```python
n = b if bin(a).count('1') & 1 else a
```

- `a` is 7.
- `b` is 2.

Next, let's evaluate the condition in the ternary operator:
- Convert `a` to its binary representation: `bin(7)` results in `'0b111'`.
- Count the number of '1's in the binary string: `bin(7).count('1')` is `3`.
- Check if the count is odd: `3 & 1` results in `1`, which is truthy (evaluates to `True`).

Since the condition is true, `n` is assigned the value of `b`.

Therefore, the value of `n` is now `2`. 

The states of the other variables (`l`, `a`, `b`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `l` is 2, `a` is 7, `b` is 2**
