The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it implies that there are test cases involving two integers `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). The function returns different values based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.

Given the output cases, we need to consider two main scenarios:
- Case_1: When \(n < t\), the function returns "Case 1".
- Case_2: When \(n \geq t\), the function returns "Case 2".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a pair of integers `t` and `n` (with specific constraints) and return "Case 1" if \(n < t\), and "Case 2" if \(n \geq t\).

Functionality: **The function processes two integers `t` and `n`, where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It returns "Case 1" if \(n < t\), and "Case 2" if \(n \geq t".**
