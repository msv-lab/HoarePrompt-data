The code snippet converts the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix) starting from the 4th character (index 3) into an integer and assigns it to `l`. 

- Initial value of `n` is 2.
- Binary representation of `n` is '0b10', but since we are using `[3:]`, we consider only '10'.
- Converting '10' from binary to decimal gives us 2.

So, `l` is updated to 2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `l` is 2, `a` is 7, `b` is 2**
