The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b`. It only serves to exit a loop or the most nested block it is in, but no variables are modified. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `l` is 2, `a` is 7, `b` is 2**
