The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `n` and `l` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only changes are that `a` and `b` now hold the values of the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of the last value of `n` back to an integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
