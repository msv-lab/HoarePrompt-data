Postcondition: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of the last value of `n` back to an integer. If `bin(n).count('1')` is odd, `l` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` equals `n`, and the output is 0 followed by `n`.**
