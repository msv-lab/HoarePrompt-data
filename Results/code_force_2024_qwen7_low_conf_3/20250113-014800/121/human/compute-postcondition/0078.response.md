The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This affects the variables `a` and `b` by assigning them the values read from the input, but does not affect the value of `n` or `l`, which are defined later. The value of `n` is determined by the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` being odd or even, and `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`.

Since the actual values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can represent the updated state as follows:

- `a` and `b` are assigned the values read from the input.
- `n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, otherwise `n` is `a`.
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`.
- The printed output is `n ^ l, l`, but since we are only asked to update the state, we do not include the printed output in the state.

Output State: **`a` is input value, `b` is input value, `n` is `b` if count of '1's in binary representation of `a` is odd, otherwise `n` is `a`, `l` is integer value of binary representation of `n`**
