Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer. If the number of 1s in the binary representation of `n` is odd, the output is 'second'. If the number of 1s in the binary representation of `n` is even, 'first' is printed and `n ^ l` is printed, where `l` is the integer value of the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix.**
