Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input. If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition.***
