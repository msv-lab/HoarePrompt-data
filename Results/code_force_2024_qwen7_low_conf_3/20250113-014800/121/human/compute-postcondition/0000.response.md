Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop is controlled by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will execute as long as the input integer (let's call this integer `t`) is within the specified range.

2. **Initial State Given**: We are given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For the loop to execute, the value of `t` (the input) must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This is because the loop will iterate based on the integer input provided by the user.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since `t` is the input that controls the loop, we need to ensure that `t` falls within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

Therefore, the final state should include the necessary adjustments:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)**
