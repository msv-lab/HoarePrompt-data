The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the current loop or block. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, and `index` remain unchanged, and the print statement `n ^ l` followed by `l` is executed.

Output State: **`a` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `b` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, index is increased by 2, the print output is `n ^ l` followed by `l`.**
