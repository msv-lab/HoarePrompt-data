The code snippet `print(n ^ l, l)` does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it prints the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `l`, followed by the value of `l`. Since `l` is equal to `n`, the bitwise XOR operation `n ^ l` will always result in 0 because any number XORed with itself is 0.

Therefore, the output will be `0` followed by the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is either `a` or `b` depending on the condition; `l` is equal to `n`; printed values are `0` and `n`**
