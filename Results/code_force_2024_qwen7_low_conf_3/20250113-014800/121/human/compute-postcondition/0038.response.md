Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer input from the user, `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of `n` back to an integer. If the count of '1's in the binary representation of `n` is odd, `l` is set to the value of `n`. Otherwise, `'first'` is printed to the console, and the output includes `n ^ l` and `l`.***
