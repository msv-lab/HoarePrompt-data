The code `print('first')` simply prints the string 'first' to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, the only change is that the string 'first' is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer input from the user, `l` is equal to `n`, and the string 'first' is printed to the console.**
