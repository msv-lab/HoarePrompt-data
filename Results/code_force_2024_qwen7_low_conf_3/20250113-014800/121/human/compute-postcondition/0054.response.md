According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will execute indefinitely as long as the program state allows it to continue without breaking or exiting the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
- `n` is 5
- `l` is 2
- Printed values are 7 and 2

Since this is a `while True` loop, no specific conditions need to be met for the loop to execute again. The loop will simply continue to execute because it is an infinite loop.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is 5, `l` is 2, printed values are 7 and 2**
