The given code snippet `print(n ^ l, l)` does not actually change the values of any variables; it only prints the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `l`, followed by the value of `l`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `n` and `l`, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is its original value, `l` is its original value**
