Postcondition: ***`a` is an input value, `b` is an input value, `n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, otherwise `n` is `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` excluding the "0b" prefix, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
