`a` and `b` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer input from the user, `l` is the integer obtained by converting the binary string (without '0b') of `n` back to an integer, `a` and `b` are the integers separated by a space from the input.
