Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the solution always tries to break the number `n` into two parts using a specific pattern (`l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)`), which may not always satisfy the condition `p1 ⊕ p2 = p`. For instance, consider the test case where `n = 5`. According to the problem description, valid break operations include `(1, 4)` or `(4, 1)`, but the provided solution would incorrectly try to break `5` into `2` and `3` since `int(bin(5)[3:], 2) = 2` and `5 ^ 2 = 7`, which does not match the original `n`. This violates the rule that `p1 ⊕ p2` must equal `p`.

To correctly implement the solution, Alice needs to find any pair of integers `(p1, p2)` such that `0 < p1 < p`, `0 < p2 < p`, and `p1 ⊕ p2 = p`. The current approach is too rigid and may fail for certain inputs.
