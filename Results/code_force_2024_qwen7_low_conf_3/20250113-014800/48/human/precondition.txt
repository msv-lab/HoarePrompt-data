t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a string s of n characters ('0' or '1') representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string f of n characters ('0' or '1') representing the desired state of the boxes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
