`s1` is incremented by 1. Initially, `s1` is 0, so after the increment, `s1` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is '1', `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is 1, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1'**
