`f` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `f` now holds the string input by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `s` remains as an input string since no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is an input string, `f` is the string input by the user**
