The code `f1 += 1` increments the value of `f1` by 1. The value of `f1` was previously `f1` (which is the current count of '1's in `f` plus 2 if the next `i` in `f` is '1'), so after executing this line, `f1` will be `f1 + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `c` is the total count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1', `s1` is the total count of '1's encountered in `s` during the loop, `f1` is the current count of '1's in `f` plus 3 if the next `i` in `f` is '1', `i` is the next element in `f`, `f` contains at least one element**
