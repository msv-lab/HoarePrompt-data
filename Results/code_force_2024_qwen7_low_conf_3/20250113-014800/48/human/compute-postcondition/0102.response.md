Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `c` is the total count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1' for `i` ranging from 0 to n-1, `s1` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the current value of `i` is '1', `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` must start from 0 and be less than the length of `s`.***
