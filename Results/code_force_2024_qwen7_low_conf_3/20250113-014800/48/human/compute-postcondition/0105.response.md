Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `c` is the total count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1' for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, `s1` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the current value of `i` is '1', `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` must be less than the length of `s` (i.e., `i + 1 < len(s)`). If `i` is '1', `s1` is incremented by 1 and `c` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s1` and `c` remain unchanged.**
