According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Additionally, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` must be 0

So, the modified state should be:

State: **`f` is `input_string`, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is a variable, `c` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
