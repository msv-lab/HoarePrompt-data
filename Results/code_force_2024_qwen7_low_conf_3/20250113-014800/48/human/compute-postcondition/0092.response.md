The value of `c` is incremented by 1. Initially, `c` is 1, so after the increment, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `c` is 2, `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `c` is 2, `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
