The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `c` was initially 0, so after executing `c += 1`, `c` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`f` is `input_string`, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is a variable, `c` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]`.**
