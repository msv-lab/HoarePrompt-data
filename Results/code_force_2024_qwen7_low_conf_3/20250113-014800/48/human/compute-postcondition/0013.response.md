`c` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` and `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for `c` is also not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be `i_end + 1`, `c` is increased by 1 based on the condition.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be `i_end + 1`, `c` is increased by 1 based on the condition.**
