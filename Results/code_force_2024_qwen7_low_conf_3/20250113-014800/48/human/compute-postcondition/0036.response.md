According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `f`. The loop continues as long as `f` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `f` must contain at least one element, and `f1` is increased by 1. If `i` equals '1', no changes are made to `f` and `f1` remains incremented. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. `f` must contain at least one element.
2. `f1` must be increased by 1.
3. The value of `i` does not matter since the loop will still continue as long as `f` has at least one element.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the list `f` must still have at least one element, and `f1` must be increased by 1.

State: **`f` must contain at least one element, `f1` is increased by 1**
