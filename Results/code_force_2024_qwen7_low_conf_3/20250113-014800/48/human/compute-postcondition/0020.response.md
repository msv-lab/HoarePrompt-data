Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both equal to '1', `s1` is 1, `i` is 1.***

Explanation: Given the preconditions and the if part, the only case considered is when `i` equals '1'. In this case, `s1` is set to 1 and `i` is set to 1. There is no else part provided, so no alternative condition needs to be considered. Therefore, the overall postcondition directly follows from the if part.
