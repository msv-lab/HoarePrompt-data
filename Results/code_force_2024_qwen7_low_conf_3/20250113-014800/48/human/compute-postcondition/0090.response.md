Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `c` is 1, `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]` and both are '1', `c` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
