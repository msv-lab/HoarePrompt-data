The value of `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` was initially 1, after the increment, `c` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is an input string, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is a variable, `c` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is '1' and equal to `f[i]` since the if condition was satisfied.**
