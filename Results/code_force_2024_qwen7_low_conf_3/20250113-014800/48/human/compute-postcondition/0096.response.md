Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `c` is 3, `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `s[2]` equals both `f[2]` and '1', then `c` is incremented by 1 and `s1` and `f1` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, the values of `c`, `s1`, `f1`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
