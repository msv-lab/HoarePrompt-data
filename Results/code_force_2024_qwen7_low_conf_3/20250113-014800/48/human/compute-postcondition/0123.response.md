Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', s1 is the total count of '1's in `s`, f1 is the total count of '1's in `f`, c is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', the value printed is `max(s1, f1) - c`.**
