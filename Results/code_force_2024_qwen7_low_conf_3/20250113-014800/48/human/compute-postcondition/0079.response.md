Postcondition: ***`s1` is the total count of '1's in `f`, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `f1` is either 2 or 3, `i` is the third element of the list `f`, `f` must be a list with at least three elements. If `i == '1'`, `f1` becomes 2. Otherwise, `f1` remains as 3.***
