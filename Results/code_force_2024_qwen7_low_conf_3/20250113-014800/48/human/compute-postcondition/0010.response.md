`c` is increased by 1. The condition for incrementing `c` is that `s[i+1]` and `f[i+1]` are both equal to '1', but this condition is not checked in the code snippet provided. The initial state only tells us that `n` must be greater than 1, and `c` is increased by 1 if `s[i+1]` equals `f[i+1]` and both are equal to '1'. Since the condition is not checked, `c` is simply incremented by 1. The initial state's condition about `n` being greater than 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `c` is increased by 1**
