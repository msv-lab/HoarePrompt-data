Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `c` is 2, `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both are '1', then `c` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
