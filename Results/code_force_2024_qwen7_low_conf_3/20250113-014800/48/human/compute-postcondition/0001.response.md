`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `t` is read from the input initially and is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, but `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**
