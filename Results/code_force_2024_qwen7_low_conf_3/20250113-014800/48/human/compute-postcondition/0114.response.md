Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `c` is the total count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1' for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, `s1` is the total count of '1's encountered in `s` during the loop, `f1` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is less than the length of `f`, `f` contains at least one element, and if the current value of `i` is '1', `f1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.***
