`s1` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s1` is 2, so after executing `s1 += 1`, the value of `s1` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both equal to '1', `s1` is 3, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both equal to '1', `s1` is 3, `i` is 3**
