Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `f` must contain at least one element.
   - `f1` is increased by 1 since `i` equals '1'.
   - If `i` does not equal '1', the state of the program remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The for loop iterates over each element in `f`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `f` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `f` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `f` still contains at least one element.
   - Additionally, since `f1` is increased by 1 when `i` equals '1', we need to account for this change in `f1`.

Given that `i` was '1' in the previous iteration (as indicated by `f1` being increased), the next value of `i` will be the next element in `f`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `f` must still contain at least one element, and `f1` should reflect the increase from the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `f` must contain at least one element.
- `f1` must be increased by 1 since the next `i` will be the next element in `f`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`f` must contain at least one element, and `f1` must be increased by 1 since the next `i` will be the next element in `f`**
