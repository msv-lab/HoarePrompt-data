`s1` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `f1` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it. The values of `c`, `n`, `i`, and `f` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is an input string, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is 0, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is the last index processed by the loop.
