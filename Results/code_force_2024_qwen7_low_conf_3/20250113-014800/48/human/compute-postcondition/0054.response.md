The value of `c` is incremented by 1. Initially, `c` is either 2 or 1. Since the code increments `c` by 1, if `c` was 1, it will become 2. If `c` was 2, it will remain 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is an input string, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is a variable, `c` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and the current value of `s[i]` is '1' and equal to `f[i]` since the if condition was satisfied.
