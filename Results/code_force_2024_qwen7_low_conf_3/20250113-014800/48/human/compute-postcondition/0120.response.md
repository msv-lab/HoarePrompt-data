Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `c` is the total count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1', `s1` is the total count of '1's encountered in `s` during the loop, `f1` is the current count of '1's in `f` plus 3 if the next `i` in `f` is '1', `i` is the next element in `f`, `f` contains at least one element. If `i == '1'`, `c` is incremented by 1 and `f1` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, the values of `c` and `f1` remain unchanged.***
