`s` is assigned the value of the string input from the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input is assigned to a new variable `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is an input string**
