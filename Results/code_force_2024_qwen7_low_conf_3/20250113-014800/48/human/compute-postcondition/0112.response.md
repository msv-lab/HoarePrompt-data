Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `c` is the total count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1' for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, `s1` is the total count of '1's encountered in `s` during the loop, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is less than the length of `f`, `f` contains at least one element, `f1` is 0, and the current value of `i` is '1'***
