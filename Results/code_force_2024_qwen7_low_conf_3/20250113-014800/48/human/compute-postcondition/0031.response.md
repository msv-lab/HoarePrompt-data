`f1` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is '1', and the condition that `f` must contain at least one element remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` must contain at least one element, `i` equals '1', `f1` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`f` must contain at least one element, `i` equals '1', `f1` is increased by 1**
