`c` is incremented by 1, while `n` and the conditions for `s[i]` and `f[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]` and both are equal to '1', `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]` and both are equal to '1', `c` is increased by 1**
