Postcondition: ***`s1` is the total count of '1's in `f`, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `f1` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the second element of the list `f`, `f` must be a non-empty list. If `i == '1'`, `f1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f1` remains unchanged.***
