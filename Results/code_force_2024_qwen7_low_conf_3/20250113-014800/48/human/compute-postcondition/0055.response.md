Postcondition: ***`f` is an input string, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is a variable, `c` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and the current value of `s[i]` is '1' and equal to `f[i]`. Since the if condition is satisfied, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
