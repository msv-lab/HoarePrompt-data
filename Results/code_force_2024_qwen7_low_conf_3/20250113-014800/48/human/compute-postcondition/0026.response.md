Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both equal to '1', `s1` is 3, `i` is 3.*** 

Explanation: Since the `else` part is not provided and the given `if` condition `i == '1'` does not match (as `i` is 3, not '1'), the `else` part effectively handles the case where the condition fails. Therefore, the values of `s1` and `i` remain unchanged from the precondition, while the other variables retain their roles as counters or flags without modification.
