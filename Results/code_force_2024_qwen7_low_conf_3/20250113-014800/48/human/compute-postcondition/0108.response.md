Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `c` is the total count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1'. If `i == '1'`, then `c` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is set to 1. If `i != '1'`, `s1` remains unchanged. `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` must be less than or equal to the length of `s` minus 1 (i.e., `i + 1 < len(s)`).***
