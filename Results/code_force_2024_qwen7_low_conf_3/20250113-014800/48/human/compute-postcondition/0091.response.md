Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `c` is 1 (indicating that initially, `s[0]` was compared with `f[0]` and they were both '1').
   - `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`.
   - `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop body checks if `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]` and both are '1'.
   - If true, `c` is incremented by 1.
   - The postcondition remains as described in the if part.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `s`, `c`, `s1`, `f1` remain unchanged as there is no modification outside the if condition in the loop body.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`s` is the input string, `c` is 1, `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
