Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The for loop is:
```python
for i in f:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `f`**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the iterable `f`.
   - For the loop to execute, `f` must contain at least one element.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - In each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current element from the iterable `f`.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know how `i` is used inside the loop, but we need to ensure `i` is valid for the loop to proceed.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `c` is the count of indices where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both equal to '1'.
   - `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`.
   - `f1` is 0.

### Required Adjustments:

- Since `f` is an iterable, for the loop to execute, `f` must contain at least one element. This ensures there is something to iterate over.
- The initial values of `c`, `s1`, and `f1` are provided, and they do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the iterable `f` must contain at least one element.

### Final Answer:

State: **`f` must contain at least one element**.
