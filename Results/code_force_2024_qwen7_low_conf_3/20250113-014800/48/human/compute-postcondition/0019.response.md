`s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` was 0, so now `s1` is 1. The value of `i` is 1, and since the condition to change `c` is not met (both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are not specified to be checked in the given code), the value of `c` remains unchanged. The value of `n` and `i` are also not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both equal to '1', `s1` is 1, `i` is 1.**
