Let's break down the given information and determine what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `f` is an input string.
- `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1'.
- `s1` is 0.
- `c` is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1'`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is the last index processed by the loop.

### For Loop:
```
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in `s`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to the first index of `s` and will increment with each iteration.
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 0.

2. **Variable `s`:**
   - `s` is used as the iterable in the for loop. Hence, `s` must be a non-empty string.

3. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is defined as the length of `s`, and it ensures that the loop does not exceed the bounds of the string `s`.

4. **Other Variables (`f1`, `s1`, `c`):**
   - These variables are not directly involved in the initialization for the loop but are updated within the loop body.
   - Since these variables are not part of the loop's condition or initialization, they do not need to be adjusted explicitly for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` being initialized to 0 and `s` being a non-empty string. 

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is 0, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1'`**
