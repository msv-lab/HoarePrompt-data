The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. It is expected to handle a series of test cases, where for each test case:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` and `f` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', where the i-th character of `s` and `f` represents whether there is a cat in the i-th box initially and finally, respectively.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

Based on the input, the function processes these test cases and returns the count of boxes that had cats in them both initially and finally.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of strings `s` and `f` of lengths up to \(10^5\), and returns the total count of boxes that had cats in them both initially and finally.**
