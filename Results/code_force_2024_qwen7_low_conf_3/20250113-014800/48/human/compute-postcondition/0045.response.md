The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is `input_string`, `f1` is the total count of elements in `f` that are equal to '1', `s1` is a variable, `c` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user.
