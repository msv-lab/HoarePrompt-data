According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Additionally, we need to initialize the variable `i` to start the loop from 0.

Given the initial states:
- `s` is the input string
- `c` is 0
- `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`
- `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`
- `n` is the input integer
- `f` is the input string

The necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` must be initialized to 0 to start the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`total` (not used in this context) is irrelevant, `s` is the input string, `c` is 0, `s1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
