Postcondition: ***`s1` is the total count of '1's in `f`, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `f1` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first element of the list `f`, `f` must be a non-empty list, and after the loop completes, `i` will point to the last element of the list `f`***.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the initial state and the behavior of the program after the if else block executes.
