`s1` is incremented by 1 because the code `s1 += 1` adds 1 to the current value of `s1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the conditions for incrementing `c` are not evaluated since the code only increments `s1`.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `s`, `s1` is incremented by 1, `c` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1' and `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `s1` is the new value of `s1` which is the original value plus 1.**
