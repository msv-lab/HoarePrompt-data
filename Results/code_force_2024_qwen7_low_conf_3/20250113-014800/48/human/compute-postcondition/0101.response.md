`s1` is incremented by 1, which means `s1 += 1`. The initial value of `s1` is 0, so now `s1` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `c` is the total count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1' for `i` ranging from 0 to n-1, `s1` is 1, `f1` is the updated total count of '1's in `f`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` must start from 0 and be less than the length of `s`. The current value of `i` is '1'.**
