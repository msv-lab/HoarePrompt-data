`s1` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `c` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both equal to '1', `s1` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both equal to '1', `s1` is `0`**
