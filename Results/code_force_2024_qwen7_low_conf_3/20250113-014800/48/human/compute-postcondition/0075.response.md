The value of `f1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 0 or 1 to 1 or 2 respectively. The values of `s1`, `c`, `i`, and the list `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is the total count of '1's in `f`, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `f1` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the second element of the list `f`, `f` must be a non-empty list**
