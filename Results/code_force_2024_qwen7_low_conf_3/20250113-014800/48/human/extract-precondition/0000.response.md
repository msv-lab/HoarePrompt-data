Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where the i-th character of s and f represents whether there is a cat in the i-th box initially and finally, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
