The code prints the values of `n` twice. The value of `n` is unchanged after the print statement. The value of `n_-1` remains the same as it was initially, which is equal to `n`. The value of `i` is not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `n_-1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_-1 \leq 10^3\) and equals `n`, `i` is `n-2`, and the printed output is 'n n'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `n_-1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_-1 \leq 10^3\) and equals `n`, `i` is `n-2`, and the printed output is 'n n'**
