The given code `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This changes how the input is read from standard input, but it does not affect the values of the existing variables `t` and `n`, nor does it create any new variables. Therefore, the only change is in the way input is handled for the subsequent operations.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the input function is now `sys.stdin.read`**
