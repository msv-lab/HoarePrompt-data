The code initializes an empty list called `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `data`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `results` is an empty list**
