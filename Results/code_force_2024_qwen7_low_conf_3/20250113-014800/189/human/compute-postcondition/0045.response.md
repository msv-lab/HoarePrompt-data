The given code prints `1` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` changes to `i_end + 1` at the start of the next iteration, the value of `i` used in the print statement will be `i_end + 1`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given code is:

Output State: **`n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `n_-1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
