Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer. If `n` equals 3, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is 4, the console displays '1 1', '1 3', and '4 4'. If `n` is greater than 4, the output consists of `n-2` lines each containing '1 i' where `i` ranges from `n-2` to 1, followed by the line 'n n'. In all cases, `n_` is equal to `n - 1` and `i` is equal to `n_`.***
