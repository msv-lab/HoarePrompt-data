Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `results` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `x` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `results`.
   - `y` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `results`.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are printed.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for result in results:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple in `results`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `results` after processing the current tuple.

4. **Modifications Needed**:
   - Since `results` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to start, for it to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two tuples.
   - After processing the current tuple, the next tuple will be accessed. Therefore, `x` will become the first element of the new tuple, and `y` will become the second element of the new tuple.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `results` must contain at least two tuples.
   - `x` will be the first element of the second tuple in `results`.
   - `y` will be the second element of the second tuple in `results`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`results` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`.**
