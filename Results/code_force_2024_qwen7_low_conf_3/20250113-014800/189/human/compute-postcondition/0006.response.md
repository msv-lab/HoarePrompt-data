`result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n)`. The function `func_1` is called with `n` as its argument, but the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, the value of `n` remains unchanged, and the `results` list is still empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is `data[i + 1]`, `results` is an empty list, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is `data[i + 1]`, `results` is an empty list, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`**
