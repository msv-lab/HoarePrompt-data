The code snippet assigns the value of `data[i + 1]` to the variable `n` and converts it to an integer. The variable `data` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`t`, `results`, `result`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[i + 1]`, `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 1])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`.**
