The code `print('4 4')` does not affect any variable values but simply prints the string '4 4' to the console. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, `i` is equal to `n_`, the console displays '1 1' and '1 3' and '4 3', and the console now also displays '4 4'.**
