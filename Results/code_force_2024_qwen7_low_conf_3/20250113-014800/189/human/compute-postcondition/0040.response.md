Output State: **`results` contains all the tuples processed, `x` is the first element of the last tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the last tuple in `results`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple in `results` and prints the elements.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `results` must contain at least two tuples.
- After each iteration, the loop processes the next tuple in `results`.
- When the loop finishes executing, it means all tuples in `results` have been processed.
- Therefore, `x` will be the first element of the last tuple in `results`, and `y` will be the second element of the last tuple in `results`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed.
