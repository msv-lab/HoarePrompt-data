The code `print('1 2')` prints the string `'1 2'` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `n_`, or `i`. The initial state where `n` is a value entered by `input()`, `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, `i` is equal to `n_`, and the console displays '1 1' remains unchanged except for the addition of the new print statement's output.

Output State: **`n` is a value entered by input(), `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, `i` is equal to `n_`, and the console displays '1 1 1 2'**
