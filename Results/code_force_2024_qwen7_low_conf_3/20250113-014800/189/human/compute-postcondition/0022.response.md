Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` must contain at least two elements.
   - `result` is the second tuple in `results`.
   - `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`.
   - `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are printed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (x, y) in result:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `result`.
   - In the current iteration, `(x, y)` is the second tuple in `result`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `result` must contain at least three tuples (since the first tuple has already been processed).
   - `result` is now the third tuple in `results`.
   - `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `results`.
   - `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `results`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `results` must contain at least three elements.
   - `result` is the third tuple in `results`.
   - `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `results`.
   - `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `results`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` must contain at least three elements, `result` is the third tuple in `results`, `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `results`**
