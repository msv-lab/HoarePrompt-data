Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Definition:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n - 1):`.

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - Initially, `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment to 2 (since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1).

5. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, the condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` becomes 2, `n - 1` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

So, the updated states are:

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2**
