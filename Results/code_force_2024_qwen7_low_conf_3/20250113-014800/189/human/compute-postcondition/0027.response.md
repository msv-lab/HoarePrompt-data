The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second elements of the first tuple in `results`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` are not modified by this print statement. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
