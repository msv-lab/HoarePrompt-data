The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), and for each test case \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq t\)), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\). 

The function has two cases based on the output:
- **Case_1:** If \(1 \leq t \leq 50\) and \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned here, but it processes the test cases.
- **Case_2:** If either \(t\) is not within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 50\) or \(n\) is not within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), the function returns an error message.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, and process the test cases if the conditions are met, otherwise return an error message.
