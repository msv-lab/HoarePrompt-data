`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `n_` remains unchanged and is equal to `n_ - 1`, and the value of `i` is equal to `n_`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, and `i` is equal to `n_`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, and `i` is equal to `n_`.**
