`results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, where `n` is `data[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is `data[i + 1]`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`.**
