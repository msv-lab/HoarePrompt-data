The code `print(x, y)` does not change the values of any variables; it only prints the values of `x` and `y`. The output of the print statement will be the values of `x` and `y`, but the values of `results`, `x`, and `y` themselves will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`.**
