Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` must contain at least one element.
   - `result` is the first element of `results`.
   - `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`.
   - `y` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (x, y) in result:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `result`.
   - `result` is a single tuple extracted from `results`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `result` must contain another tuple.
   - Since `result` is the first element of `results`, `results` must have at least two elements for the loop to continue.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `results` must now have at least two elements.
   - `result` will be the second tuple in `results`.
   - `x` will be the first element of this new `result` tuple.
   - `y` will be the second element of this new `result` tuple.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`results` must contain at least two elements, `result` is the second tuple in `results`, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`**
