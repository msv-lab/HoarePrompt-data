The code `print(x, y)` simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since the values of `x` and `y` are already determined by their roles in the `results` tuple, printing them does not change their values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`, the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
