According to the given for loop statement:
```
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to but not including `n - 1`. This means that the loop variable `i` takes values from 1 to `n-2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n_-1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
1. The new value of `i` should be within the range 1 to `n-2`.
2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i_end + 2`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i_end + 2` is still within the range 1 to `n-2`. This implies that `i_end` must have been in the range 1 to `n-3`.

Given these considerations, let's adjust the states:

- `n` remains the same.
- `n_-1` remains the same.
- `i` will be `i_end + 2`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i_end + 2` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` will be `i_end + 2`.

So, the updated states are:
State: **`n` remains the same, `n_-1` remains the same, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
