The code appends the `result` to the `results` list. The `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `data` is a non-empty list.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 1]`.
- `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 2])`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`.

After executing the line `results.append(result)`, the `results` list will include the new result appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 1]`, `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 2])` and the return value of `func_1(n)`, and we append the return value of `func_1(n)` to `results`.**
