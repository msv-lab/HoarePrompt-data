The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it implies that the parameters `t`, `n`, and tuples `(x, y)` are provided externally or through some context not shown in the function definition itself. Based on the constraints and relationships given:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- Each `(x, y)` represents coordinates of a cell in an \(n \times n\) grid where \(1 \leq x, y \leq n\), and the coordinates must be distinct for different cells within the same test case.

Given these details, the function `func_2` should process these inputs according to the specified constraints and relationships. However, since the exact processing logic isn't provided in the function definition, we focus solely on the input parameters and their descriptions.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs `t`, `n`, and tuples `(x, y)` where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), and each `(x, y)` represents distinct coordinates in an \(n \times n\) grid where \(1 \leq x, y \leq n\).**
