Output State: **`results` is a list of tuples, each tuple representing the return values of `func_1(data[i + 1])` for each iteration where `i` ranges from `0` to `t-1`, `result` is the last tuple in the `results` list, `x` is the first element of the last tuple in `results`, and `y` is the second element of the last tuple in `results`, and these values are printed after the loop completes.**
