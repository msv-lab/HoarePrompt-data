The code `print(f'{n} 2')` prints the value of `n` followed by a space and then the number 2. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n` and `i`). Therefore, the output consists of `n-2` lines each containing '1 i' where `i` ranges from `n-2` to 1, and the additional output is 'n n'. The value of `n` remains the same, and the value of `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the output consists of `n-2` lines each containing '1 i' where `i` ranges from `n-2` to 1, and the additional output is 'n n'**
