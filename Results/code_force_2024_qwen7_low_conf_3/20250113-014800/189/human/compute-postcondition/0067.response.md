The code prints the string '1 (i)', where `i` is the value of `n - 1`. The print statement does not assign any new values to variables but outputs the value of `i`. The values of `n` and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 1`, the output is '1 (i)'**
