Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`
   - `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`
   - `i` is equal to `n_`

2. **Loop Definition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n - 1)`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop `for i in range(1, n - 1)` to execute, the condition `1 <= i < n - 1` must hold true.

4. **Determining Necessary Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 because `range(1, n - 1)` requires `n - 1 > 1`, or equivalently, `n > 2`.
   - `i` should be within the range `1` to `n - 2` (inclusive).

5. **Analyzing the Given States:**
   - `n` is determined by `int(input())`, so we need to ensure `n > 2`.
   - `n_ = n - 1` means `n_` is one less than `n`. Since `i` is set to `n_`, if `n > 2`, then `n_` will be `n - 1`, and `i` will be `n - 1`.

Given these points, let's formulate the necessary states:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` must be equal to `n - 1` because `n_` is set to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 1`**
