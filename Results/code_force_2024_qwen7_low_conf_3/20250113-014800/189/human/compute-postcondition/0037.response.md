The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second elements of the third tuple in `results`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` are not changed by this print statement. The `results` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least three tuples, `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `results`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
