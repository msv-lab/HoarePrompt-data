Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints specific pairs of integers based on the value of `n`. Specifically:
- If `n` is 2, it prints '1 1' followed by `t` lines of '1 2'.
- If `n` is 3, it prints '2 1' followed by '2 3' and '3 1'.
- If `n` is 4, it prints '1 1', '1 3', '4 3', and '4 4'.
- For any other value of `n`, it prints `t` lines of '1 i' where `i` ranges from `n - t` to 1, followed by 'n n' and 'n 2'.

After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the console output contains the specified pairs of integers for each test case, and no further operations are performed on the input variables `t` and `n`.**

This summary includes all the potential cases mentioned in the annotations and also clarifies the overall behavior of the function without delving into implementation details.
