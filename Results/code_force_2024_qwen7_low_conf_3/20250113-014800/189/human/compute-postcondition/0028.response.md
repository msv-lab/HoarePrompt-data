According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, and `y` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two tuples, as the loop will then iterate over the second tuple.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `results` contains at least two tuples, and the loop will start with the second tuple. The first tuple will now be processed in the next iteration, and `x` and `y` will take the values from the second tuple.

State: **`results` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`**
