`results` appends the value of `result`, which is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`. The value of `result` is already defined in the initial state as the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[i + 1]`, `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 1])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`, and `results` is updated by appending `result`.**
