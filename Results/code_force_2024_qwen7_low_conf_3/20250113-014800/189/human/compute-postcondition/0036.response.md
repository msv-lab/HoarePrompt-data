Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `results` must contain at least two tuples.
   - `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`.
   - `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `results`.

3. **Current Iteration**: After the previous iteration, the loop has processed one tuple. Therefore, the current tuple being processed would be the second tuple in `results` if there are at least two tuples.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next tuple in `results`. Since `results` must contain at least two tuples, the next tuple will be the third tuple in `results`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `results` must still contain at least two tuples, but now it needs to have at least three tuples to proceed to the next iteration.
   - `x` will be the first element of the third tuple in `results`.
   - `y` will be the second element of the third tuple in `results`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`results` must contain at least three tuples, `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `results`**.
