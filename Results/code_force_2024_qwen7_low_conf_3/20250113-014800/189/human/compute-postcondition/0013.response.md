The code snippet `n = int(data[i + 1])` assigns the value of `data[i + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The value of `data[i + 1]` is a part of the list `data`, and since `data` is a non-empty list, `data[i + 1]` is an element of this list. The conversion to an integer changes its type but not its value (assuming the value was originally convertible to an integer). 

Given the initial conditions, the only change is that `n` now holds the integer value of `data[i + 1]`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 1]`, `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 2])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 2])`**
