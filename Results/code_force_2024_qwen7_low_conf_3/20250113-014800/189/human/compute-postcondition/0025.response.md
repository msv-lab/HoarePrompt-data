According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop continues as long as there are more tuples in `results` to process.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `results` must contain at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.
- `result` is the last tuple processed in the loop.
- `x` is the first element of the last tuple processed.
- `y` is the second element of the last tuple processed.
- The values of `x` and `y` are printed after each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple in `results` to process. This means that `results` must contain at least one more tuple.

Let's summarize the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `results` must now contain at least one more tuple than it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `result` will be the new last tuple in `results`.
- `x` will be the first element of the new last tuple.
- `y` will be the second element of the new last tuple.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`results` must contain at least one more tuple than it did at the end of the previous iteration, `result` is the last tuple processed in the loop, `x` is the first element of the last tuple processed, `y` is the second element of the last tuple processed, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed after each iteration.**
