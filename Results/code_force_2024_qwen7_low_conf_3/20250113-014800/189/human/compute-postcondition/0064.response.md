The code `print('4 3')` simply prints the string '4 3' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `n_`, or `i`. The initial state is that `n` is an input integer, `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, `i` is equal to `n_`, and the console displays '1 1' and '1 3'. Since the code does not change these variables, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, `i` is equal to `n_`, and the console displays '1 1' and '1 3' and '4 3'**
