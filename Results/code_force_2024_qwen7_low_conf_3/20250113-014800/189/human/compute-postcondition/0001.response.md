The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from the standard input (using `sys.stdin.read`), splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**
