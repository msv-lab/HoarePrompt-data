Output State: **`results` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `results`, `y` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `results`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.** 

Explanation:
- The loop runs for as long as there are tuples in `results` to process.
- After the loop finishes, `results` must contain at least one tuple because the loop processes the last tuple in `results`.
- `x` and `y` will be the first and second elements of the last tuple processed in `results`.
- The values of `x` and `y` are printed after each iteration, so they will be the values of the last tuple processed when the loop ends.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `results` is empty), then `x` and `y` will be undefined or not printed since there are no tuples to process. However, the condition still holds that `results` must contain at least one tuple to start the loop, which means the loop will not run if `results` is empty.
