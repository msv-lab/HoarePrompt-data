`result` is assigned the value of `func_1(n)`. Here, `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 1]`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 1]`, `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 2])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`**
