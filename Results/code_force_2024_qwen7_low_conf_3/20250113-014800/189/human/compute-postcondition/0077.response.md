Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `n_` is equal to `n - 1`, and `i` is equal to `n_`. If `n` is 2, the console displays '1 1 1 2'. If `n` is 3, `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is 4, the console displays '1 1', '1 3', and '4 4'. If `n` is greater than 4, the output consists of `n-2` lines each containing '1 i' where `i` ranges from `n-2` to 1, followed by the line 'n n'.**
