The code assigns the value of `data[i + 1]` to `n`. Since `data` is a non-empty list, `data[i + 1]` refers to one of its elements. However, the exact value of `data[i + 1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we represent it as `data[i + 1]`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still a positive integer.
- `data` remains a non-empty list.
- `n` is now set to the value of `data[i + 1]`.
- `results` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is data[i + 1], `results` is an empty list**
