According to the given for loop, the loop variable `result` iterates over the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The loop body is omitted, but the execution of the loop depends on the presence of elements in the `results` list.

Let's break down the required states:

1. **`results` must contain at least one element**: This ensures that there is something to iterate over in the loop.
2. **The loop will start with the first element of `results`**: Since the loop iterates over `results`, the initial value of `result` should be the first element of the list.
3. **No specific state changes for `t`, `data`, or `result`**: These variables are not directly involved in the loop's execution as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`results` must contain at least one element, result is the first element of `results`**
