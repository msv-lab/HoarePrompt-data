The code `print('1 1')` prints the string '1 1' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `n_`, or `i`. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, `i` is equal to `n_`, and the console displays '1 1'**
