Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer. If `n` is 4, the console displays '1 1', '1 3', and '4 4'. If `n` is greater than 1, the output consists of `n-2` lines each containing '1 i' where `i` ranges from `n-2` to 1, and the additional output is 'n n'. `n_` is equal to `n - 1` and `i` is equal to `n_`.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts and their respective outputs.
