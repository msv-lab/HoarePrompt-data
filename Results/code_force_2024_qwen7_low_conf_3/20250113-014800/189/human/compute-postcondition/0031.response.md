The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second elements of the third tuple in `results`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` themselves are not changed by this code. The output of the print statement will display the values of `x` and `y`, but the variables `results`, `x`, and `y` retain their original references and values.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state, with the additional information that the values of `x` and `y` are printed.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least three tuples, `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `results`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
