The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second elements of the second tuple in `results`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` themselves do not change; they just get printed. The `print` function does not modify the variables, it only outputs their current values.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least two elements, `result` is the second tuple in `results`, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`, the values of `x` and `y` are printed**
