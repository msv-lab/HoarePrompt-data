The code `result = func_1(n)` assigns the return value of `func_1(n)` to the variable `result`. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[i + 1]`, and `func_1` is a function that takes an argument and returns some value, which in this case is assigned to `result`.

Therefore, the variable `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[i + 1]`, `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 1])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`.**
