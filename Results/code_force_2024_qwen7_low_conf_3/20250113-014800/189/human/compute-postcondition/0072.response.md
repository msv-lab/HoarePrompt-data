Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the output consists of `n-2` lines each containing '1 i' where `i` ranges from `n-2` to 1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
   - `n_` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - `i` is equal to `n_`, which means initially `i = n - 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n - 2` (exclusive), meaning the loop will execute `n - 2` times.
   - During each iteration, it prints `1 i`.

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be set to the starting value of the loop, which is `1` because the loop increments `i` but the final value of `i` used in the last iteration is `n - 2`. However, the next line sets `i` to `1` before the loop starts.
   - Since the loop runs `n - 2` times, the output will consist of `n - 2` lines, each containing `'1 i'` where `i` ranges from `n - 2` down to `1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless the input changes, so it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `n` is 1 or 2, the loop does not execute, and the values remain as they were initialized:
     - `n` is the value entered by the user.
     - `i` is `n - 1`.
     - No output lines are generated.

Thus, the final state of the variables and the output after all iterations of the loop have finished is as stated above.
