Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `n_` is `n - t`, where `t` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `i` is `n - t`. If `t` is 0, `n_` is `n` and `i` is undefined (or remains `n`). If `n` is 2, the console displays '1 1' followed by `t` lines of '1 2'. If `n` is 3, the console displays '3 1'. If `n` is 4, the console displays '4 4'. For other values of `n`, the console displays `t` lines of '1 i', starting from `n - t` down to 1, followed by the line 'n n' and 'n 2'.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Condition**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `n_` is initially `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `n_` times.
   - Each iteration updates `n` based on user input, but the loop structure ensures that `n_` decreases by 1 each time.
   - After the loop, `n_` becomes `n - t`, where `t` is the number of times the loop has executed.
   - `i` is updated within the loop to reflect the current value of `n_`.

3. **Output Pattern**:
   - For `n = 2`, the loop outputs '1 1' followed by `t` lines of '1 2'.
   - For `n = 3`, the output is always '3 1'.
   - For `n = 4`, the output is '4 4'.
   - For other values of `n`, the output consists of `t` lines of '1 i', starting from `n - t` down to 1, followed by the line 'n n' and 'n 2'.

4. **Final State**:
   - When the loop finishes, `n` retains its final value (`n - t`).
   - `n_` is `n - t`.
   - `i` is `n - t`.

Thus, the final output state captures the values of `n`, `n_`, and `i` after the loop completes its iterations.
