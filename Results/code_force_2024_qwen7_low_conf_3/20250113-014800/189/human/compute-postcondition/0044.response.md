Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `n_-1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_-1 \leq 10^3\) and equals `n_-1`
- `i` is unchanged

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the current iteration, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

2. **Identify the Value of `i` at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is unchanged from the previous iteration, letâ€™s denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`.

3. **Update the Value of `i`:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i_end + 1` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n_-1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` changes to `i_end + 1`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `n_-1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_-1 \leq 10^3\) and equals `n_-1`
- `i` is `i_end + 1`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state accordingly. Let's denote `i_end` as the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `n_-1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_-1 \leq 10^3\) and equals `n_-1`, `i` is `i_end + 1`**
