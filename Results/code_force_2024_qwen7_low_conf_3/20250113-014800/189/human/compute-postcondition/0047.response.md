The code prints the string '1 i' where `i` is the current value of the variable `i`. Since the value of `i` is given as `i_end + 2`, this value is used in the print statement. The other variables (`n`, `n_-1`, and `i_end`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `n_-1` remains the same, `i` is `i_end + 2`, printed output is '1 i_end + 2'**
