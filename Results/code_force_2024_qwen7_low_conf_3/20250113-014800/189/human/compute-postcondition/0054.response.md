The given code snippet is a simple `print()` statement which does not change any variable's value or perform any operations. It only prints something to the console. Based on the initial state, we know the behavior of printing for different values of `n` and `n_-1`. Since no operations are performed, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `n_` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_ \leq 10^3\) and equals `n_-1`. If `n` is 2, the output is '1 2'. If `n` is 3, the printed output is '3 1'. If `n` is 4, the console displays '4 4'. Otherwise, the console displays 'n 2' and `i` is set to `n - 2`**
