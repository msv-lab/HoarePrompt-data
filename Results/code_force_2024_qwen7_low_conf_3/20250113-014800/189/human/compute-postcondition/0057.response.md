The code `print('1 1')` prints the string '1 1' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables but simply outputs a string. The initial state of `n`, `n_`, and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a value entered by input(), `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, `i` is equal to `n_`, and the console displays '1 1'**
