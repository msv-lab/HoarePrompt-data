Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `n_` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_ \leq 10^3\) and equals `n_-1`.
   - The value of `n_` is based on the previous value of `n`.

2. **Output Patterns:**
   - If `n` is 2, the output is '1 2'.
   - If `n` is 3, the output is '3 1'.
   - If `n` is 4, the output is '4 4'.
   - For other values of `n`, the output is 'n 2', and `i` is set to `n - 2`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `n_` times.
   - Since `n_` is derived from the previous value of `n`, we need to consider how `n_` changes as the loop progresses.

4. **Loop Logic:**
   - At the end of each iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` starts from 1 (since the loop runs from 0 to `n_-1`).

5. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the new state for the next iteration of the loop.

6. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `n_` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_ \leq 10^3\) and equals `n_-1`.
   - The loop runs `n_` times.

7. **Next Iteration:**
   - After the loop completes its current iteration, `i` will be equal to `n_` (since it starts from 0 and increments up to `n_-1`).
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be `n_` and `n_` will be decremented by 1 (since `n_` is derived from the previous value of `n`).

8. **New State:**
   - The new value of `n_` will be `n_-1 - 1` or simply `n_ - 1`.
   - The new value of `i` will be `n_`.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n_` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `n_` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_ \leq 10^3\) and equals `n_ - 1`, `i` is `n_`.**
