The code `print('1 3')` prints the string '1 3' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `n_`, `i`, or the initial print statement '1 1'. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_` is equal to `n_ - 1`, `i` is equal to `n_`, and the console displays '1 1' and '1 3'**
