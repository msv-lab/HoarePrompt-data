According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least four tuples because it starts from the third tuple and the loop iterates over each tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least three tuples, `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `results`, and `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `results`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must now contain at least four tuples. The loop will then process the fourth tuple in `results`, setting `x` to the first element of the fourth tuple and `y` to the second element of the fourth tuple.

State: **`results` must contain at least four tuples, `x` is the first element of the fourth tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the fourth tuple in `results`**
