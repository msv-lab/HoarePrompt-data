The code prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second elements of the fourth tuple in `results`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` are not printed but are simply displayed on the console. The values of `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged after the print statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least four tuples, `x` is the first element of the fourth tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the fourth tuple in `results`**
