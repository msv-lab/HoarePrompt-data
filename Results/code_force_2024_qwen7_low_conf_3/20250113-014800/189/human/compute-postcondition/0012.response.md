Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `data` is a non-empty list.
   - `n` is an integer value equal to `data[i + 1]`.
   - `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 1])`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`.

2. **Loop Analysis**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `t`. This means the loop iterates from `0` to `t-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - **`i`**: Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` was the highest value it reached. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`.
   - **`n`**: `n` is defined as `data[i + 1]`. After the previous iteration, `i` was the highest value, so `i + 1` would be the next element in the list. Therefore, `n` should now be `data[i + 2]`.
   - **`results`**: The results list is updated by appending the new result `func_1(data[i + 1])`. After the previous iteration, `results` contains all previous results plus the latest result. For the next iteration, the `results` list should contain all previous results plus the next result, which is `func_1(data[i + 2])`.
   - **`result`**: The `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`. For the next iteration, the `result` will be `func_1(data[i + 2])`.

4. **Final State**: After adjusting the states for the next iteration:
   - `t` remains unchanged because `t` defines the number of iterations and does not change within the loop.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by `1` to `i + 1`.
   - `n` becomes `data[i + 1]` (which is `data[i + 2]` after the previous iteration).
   - `results` should include all previous results plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 2])`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 2])`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is data[i + 2], `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[i + 2])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 2])`**.
