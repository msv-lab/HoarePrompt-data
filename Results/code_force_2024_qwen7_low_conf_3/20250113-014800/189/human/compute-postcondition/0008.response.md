According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is `data[i + 1]`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. `i` will be incremented by 1, so if the current `i` is `k`, the next `i` will be `k + 1`.
2. The condition for the next iteration is `i < t`. Therefore, `i` needs to be `k + 1` and `t` remains the same.
3. `data` does not change within the loop.
4. `n` will be updated to `data[i + 1]`, which means `n` will become `data[k + 2]`.
5. `results` will be updated to include the result of `func_1(data[i + 1])`, so it will contain the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `result`.
6. `result` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])`, which will be `func_1(data[k + 2])`.

Given the above steps, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`, and all other variables remain as described above.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `n` is `data[i + 1]` (which becomes `data[k + 2]`), `results` is a list containing the results from the previous iterations plus the new result `func_1(data[k + 2])`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(data[k + 2])`**.
