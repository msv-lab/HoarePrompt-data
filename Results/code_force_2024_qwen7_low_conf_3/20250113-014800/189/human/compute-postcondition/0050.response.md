The code prints the value of `n` followed by the integer `2`. This does not change the values of the variables `n`, `n_-1`, or `i`, but it does alter the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `n_-1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n_-1 \leq 10^3\) and equals `n`, `i` is `n-2`, and the printed output is 'n 2'**
