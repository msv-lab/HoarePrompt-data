Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - The output is '1 (i)'.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n - 2` (inclusive).

4. **Previous Iteration Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, it means the loop has just completed its last iteration where `i = n - 1`.
   - Before this last iteration, `i` would have been `n - 2`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be within the range of 1 to `n - 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be set to `1` for the next iteration.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as the condition `n > 2` still holds.
   - `i` is reset to `1` to start the next iteration.

7. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The output is not specified for the next iteration but follows the same pattern as before.

**State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1**
