Based on the given information and the analysis provided, let's break down the necessary adjustments step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `results` must contain at least one tuple.
- `x` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `results`.
- `y` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `results`.
- The values of `x` and `y` are printed.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as there are tuples in `results`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least one more tuple after processing the current tuple.

2. **Current Tuple Processing**:
   - In the previous iteration, the current tuple `(x, y)` was processed from `results`.

3. **Next Tuple Access**:
   - In the next iteration, the loop will access the next tuple in `results`.
   - `x` will then refer to the first element of this next tuple.
   - `y` will then refer to the second element of this next tuple.

### Updated State:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two tuples.
- The first tuple in `results` is the one that was just processed, with `x` being its first element and `y` being its second element.
- The second tuple in `results` is the one that will be processed in the next iteration, with `x` becoming its first element and `y` becoming its second element.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `results` must contain at least two tuples.
- `x` will be the first element of the second tuple in `results`.
- `y` will be the second element of the second tuple in `results`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`results` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`.**

State: **`results` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`.**
