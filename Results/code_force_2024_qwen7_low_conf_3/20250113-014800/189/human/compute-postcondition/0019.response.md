The code prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second elements of the first tuple in `results`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` are not changed by the print statement. The print statement does not affect the values of `results`, `result`, `x`, and `y`; it only outputs them. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least one element, `result` is the first element of `results`, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `results`, `y` is the second element of the first tuple in `results`**
