### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and the Given Solution:**
   - The problem requires placing \( n \) points on an \( n \times n \) grid such that the number of unique Manhattan distances between any two points is maximized.
   - The `func_1` function generates \( n \) points using the formula \( x = i + 1 \) and \( y = i * 2 \% n + 1 \).
   - The `func_2` function reads input and processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function generates points \((x, y)\) where \( x = i + 1 \) and \( y = i * 2 \% n + 1 \).
   - This formula ensures that the \( y \)-values are distributed across the grid, which helps in maximizing the number of unique Manhattan distances.

3. **Testing the Function:**
   - We need to verify if the function `func_1` indeed generates points that maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances for various \( n \).
   - Let's manually check a few small values of \( n \) to see if the function works as expected.

4. **Verification:**
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3 \% 2 + 1) = (2, 1)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-2| + |1-1| \} = \{1\}\)
     - This doesn't maximize the number of unique distances, but let's consider the next test case.

   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 1 \% 3 + 1) = (2, 3)\), \((3, 2 \times 2 \% 3 + 1) = (3, 2)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |1-2|, |2-3| + |3-2| \} = \{2, 1, 3\}\)
     - This gives 3 unique distances, which is optimal for \( n = 3 \).

   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 1 \% 4 + 1) = (2, 3)\), \((3, 2 \times 2 \% 4 + 1) = (3, 1)\), \((4, 2 \times 3 \% 4 + 1) = (4, 3)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |1-2|, |2-3| + |3-1|, |2-3| + |3-3|, |3-4| + |3-3| \} = \{2, 1, 2, 1, 1\}\)
     - This gives 3 unique distances, which is optimal for \( n = 4 \).

   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 1 \% 5 + 1) = (2, 3)\), \((3, 2 \times 2 \% 5 + 1) = (3, 5)\), \((4, 2 \times 3 \% 5 + 1) = (4, 1)\), \((5, 2 \times 4 \% 5 + 1) = (5, 3)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |1-2|, |2-3| + |3-5|, |2-3| + |3-1|, |3-4| + |1-3|, |3-5| + |3-3|, |4-5| + |3-3| \} = \{2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1\}\)
     - This gives 3 unique distances, which is optimal for \( n = 5 \).

   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 1 \% 6 + 1) = (2, 3)\), \((3, 2 \times 2 \% 6 + 1) = (3, 5)\), \((4, 2 \times 3 \% 6 + 1) = (4, 1)\), \((5, 2 \times 4 \% 6 + 1) = (5, 3)\), \((6, 2 \times 5 \% 6 + 1) = (6, 1)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-3|, |1-3| + |1-2|, |2-3| + |3-5|, |2-3| + |3-1|, |3-4| + |1-3|, |3-5| + |3-1|, |4-5| + |3-3|, |4-6| + |1-1|, |5-6| + |1-1| \} = \{2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1\}\)
     - This gives 3 unique distances, which is optimal for \( n = 6 \).

Based on these tests, the function `func_1` does generate points that maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances for the tested values of \( n \).

However, there is a critical issue with the function `func_1` for \( n = 2 \). As shown, the unique Manhattan distances for \( n = 2 \) only give 1 unique distance, which is not optimal. The function fails to maximize the number of unique distances for \( n = 2 \).

Therefore, the program as a whole is not entirely correct because it does not handle the case when \( n = 2 \) correctly.
