Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into individual test cases. For each test case, it extracts the integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` generates `n` points in the grid.
   - The coordinates `(x, y)` are generated such that `x = i + 1` and `y = i * 2 % n + 1`. This ensures that the points are distinct and cover the grid in a systematic manner.
   - The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates of a point in the grid.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - For each test case, the function `func_2` calls `func_1(n)` to generate the points.
   - It collects the results from each call to `func_1` in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the coordinates of all the points generated for each test case.

4. **Maximizing Manhattan Distances:**
   - The generated points ensure that the Manhattan distances between any two points are maximized. The coordinates are chosen such that the maximum possible distinct distances are achieved.
   - Specifically, the pattern `x = i + 1` and `y = i * 2 % n + 1` ensures that the points are spread out across the grid, maximizing the diversity of Manhattan distances.

Given these observations, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It handles multiple test cases, generates the required points for each test case, and prints them in the correct format. Therefore, the program is correct.
