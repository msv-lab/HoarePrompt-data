### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and the Given Solution:**
   - The problem requires placing \( n \) points on an \( n \times n \) grid such that the number of unique Manhattan distances between any two points is maximized.
   - The `func_1` function generates points using a specific formula: \( x = i + 1 \) and \( y = i \times 2 \% n + 1 \).
   - The `func_2` function reads input and processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function generates points where \( y \) is distributed across the grid due to the modulo operation. This distribution ensures that the \( y \)-coordinates are spread out, which helps in maximizing the number of unique Manhattan distances.
   - However, let's manually verify the function for a few small values of \( n \) to ensure its correctness.

3. **Verification:**
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 0 \% 2 + 1) = (2, 1)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-2| + |1-1| \} = \{1\}\)
     - This doesn't maximize the number of unique distances, which is 1 instead of 2. The optimal configuration for \( n = 2 \) would be \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), giving distances \(\{1\}\) and \(\{0\}\), resulting in 2 unique distances.

   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 0 \% 3 + 1) = (2, 1)\), \((3, 2 \times 1 \% 3 + 1) = (3, 3)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-3| \} = \{1, 2, 2\}\)
     - This gives 2 unique distances, which is not optimal. The optimal configuration for \( n = 3 \) would be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), giving distances \(\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3\}\), resulting in 3 unique distances.

   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 0 \% 4 + 1) = (2, 1)\), \((3, 2 \times 1 \% 4 + 1) = (3, 3)\), \((4, 2 \times 2 \% 4 + 1) = (4, 5)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |3-5|, |3-4| + |3-5| \} = \{1, 2, 2, 2, 2\}\)
     - This gives 2 unique distances, which is not optimal. The optimal configuration for \( n = 4 \) would be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), giving distances \(\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4\}\), resulting in 4 unique distances.

   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 0 \% 5 + 1) = (2, 1)\), \((3, 2 \times 1 \% 5 + 1) = (3, 3)\), \((4, 2 \times 2 \% 5 + 1) = (4, 5)\), \((5, 2 \times 3 \% 5 + 1) = (5, 7)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |3-5|, |3-4| + |3-5|, |3-5| + |5-7| \} = \{1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2\}\)
     - This gives 2 unique distances, which is not optimal. The optimal configuration for \( n = 5 \) would be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), giving distances \(\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5\}\), resulting in 5 unique distances.

   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2 \times 0 \% 6 + 1) = (2, 1)\), \((3, 2 \times 1 \% 6 + 1) = (3, 3)\), \((4, 2 \times 2 \% 6 + 1) = (4, 5)\), \((5, 2 \times 3 \% 6 + 1) = (5, 7)\), \((6, 2 \times 4 \% 6 + 1) = (6, 9)\)
     - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{ |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |3-5|, |3-4| + |3-5|, |3-5| + |5-7|, |4-5| + |3-7|, |4-6| + |5-9|, |5-6| + |7-9| \} = \{1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2\}\)
     - This gives 2 unique distances, which is not optimal. The optimal configuration for \( n = 6 \) would be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\), giving distances \(\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6\}\), resulting in 6 unique distances.

From the above manual verification, it is clear that the function `func_1` does not always generate points that maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
