### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Function `func_1(n)`:

```python
def func_1(n):
    points = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = i + 1
        y = i * 2 % n + 1
        points.append((x, y))
    return points
```

- For a given \( n \), the function generates points such that the \( x \)-coordinate is \( i + 1 \) and the \( y \)-coordinate is \( i \times 2 \mod n + 1 \).
- This means for each \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \), the points generated are \((i+1, i*2 \mod n + 1)\).

#### Example for \( n = 4 \):

- Points generated are:
  - For \( i = 0 \): \((1, 1)\)
  - For \( i = 1 \): \((2, 3)\)
  - For \( i = 2 \): \((3, 1)\)
  - For \( i = 3 \): \((4, 3)\)

- The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 3)\): \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3 \)
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 1)\): \( |1-3| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2 \)
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((4, 3)\): \( |1-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
  - Between \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 1)\): \( |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 \)
  - Between \((2, 3)\) and \((4, 3)\): \( |2-4| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2 \)
  - Between \((3, 1)\) and \((4, 3)\): \( |3-4| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3 \)

The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{2, 3, 5\}\), and the size of this set is 3.

#### Function `func_2()`:

```python
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(data[i + 1])
        result = func_1(n)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        for x, y in result:
            print(x, y)
```

- The function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1(n)` to generate the points and appends the result to the `results` list.
- Finally, it prints the coordinates of the points for each test case.

#### Testing the Functionality:

1. **Test Case for \( n = 2 \)**:
   - Points generated: \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 3 \mod 2 + 1) = (1, 1)\). This results in only one unique point \((1, 1)\).
   - Distances: \(\{0\}\), size: 1.

2. **Test Case for \( n = 3 \)**:
   - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3 \mod 3 + 1) = (2, 1)\), \((3, 6 \mod 3 + 1) = (3, 1)\).
   - Distances: \(\{0, 2, 2\}\), size: 2.

3. **Test Case for \( n = 4 \)**:
   - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 3)\).
   - Distances: \(\{2, 3, 5\}\), size: 3.

4. **Test Case for \( n = 5 \)**:
   - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 3)\), \((5, 1)\).
   - Distances: \(\{2, 3, 5, 4\}\), size: 4.

5. **Test Case for \( n = 6 \)**:
   - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 3)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 3)\).
   - Distances: \(\{2, 3, 5, 4, 6\}\), size: 5.

#### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` correctly generates points that maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. However, the example provided in the problem description suggests a different pattern. Specifically, for \( n = 4 \), the expected maximum set of distances is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), but the function generates \(\{2, 3, 5\}\). This indicates that the function does not always achieve the maximum possible set of distances.

Thus, while the function works for some cases, it does not guarantee the maximal set of distances for all \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is not always correct because it does not generate the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all test cases.
