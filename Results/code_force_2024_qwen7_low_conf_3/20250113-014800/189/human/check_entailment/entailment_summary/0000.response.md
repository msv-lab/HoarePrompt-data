Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a set of points in an \(n \times n\) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized.
- The provided code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` generates a list of points based on a specific pattern for a given \(n\).
- `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases using `func_1`, and prints the resulting points.

For each test case, `func_1` is called with \(n\) as an argument and returns a list of points. The example outputs provided in the problem statement show that `func_1` successfully generates points that maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for various \(n\).

Given the execution summary and the examples provided:
- `func_1` appears to generate valid points for maximizing the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
- `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the points generated by `func_1`.

There are no indications that `func_1` or `func_2` have issues with handling invalid input or failing to produce the correct output based on the examples and the problem constraints.

Therefore, the given program appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
