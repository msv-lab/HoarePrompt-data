You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    points = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = i + 1
        y = i * 2 % n + 1
        points.append((x, y))
    return points
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)) and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two elements: the first element is `i + 1` and the second element is `i * 2 % n + 1`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. After the function executes, the final state of the program is that the variable `points` holds the list of tuples described above.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(data[i + 1])
        result = func_1(n)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        for (x, y) in result:
            print(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\) and multiple coordinate pairs \((x, y)\) in an \(n \times n\) grid. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute some result, which is then stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each coordinate pair \((x, y)\) from the final result of `func_1(n)` for the last test case. The function accepts no direct parameters but reads input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases \(t\), followed by \(t\) lines, each starting with \(n\) and then a series of coordinate pairs \((x, y)\). If `func_1(n)` returns a list of coordinate pairs, the function prints these pairs after processing all test cases. However, if `func_1(n)` does not handle invalid \(n\) values (e.g., \(n < 2\) or \(n > 10^3\)), the function may encounter unexpected behavior or errors, as these conditions are not checked within the given code. Additionally, if `func_1(n)` does not ensure that all coordinate pairs \((x, y)\) are distinct within the same test case, the function will print potentially duplicate coordinates.
