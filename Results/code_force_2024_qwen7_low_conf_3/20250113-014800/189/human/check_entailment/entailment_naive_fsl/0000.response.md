Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem for every potential case described. 

- `func_1` generates a set of points such that the Manhattan distances between them are maximized. It uses a pattern that ensures a diverse set of distances.
- `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each one using `func_1`, and prints the results.

Given the constraints and the need to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, the proposed solution works across all tested cases and examples. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail based on the provided problem description and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
