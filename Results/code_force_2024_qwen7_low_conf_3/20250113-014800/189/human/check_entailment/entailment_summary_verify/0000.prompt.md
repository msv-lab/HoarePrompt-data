You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/52d127e3dbe0141bb58dbdf4158586772a208758.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    points = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = i + 1
        y = i * 2 % n + 1
        points.append((x, y))
    return points

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(data[i + 1])
        result = func_1(n)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        for (x, y) in result:
            print(x, y)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\) and multiple coordinate pairs \((x, y)\) in an \(n \times n\) grid. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute some result, which is then stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each coordinate pair \((x, y)\) from the final result of `func_1(n)` for the last test case. The function accepts no direct parameters but reads input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases \(t\), followed by \(t\) lines, each starting with \(n\) and then a series of coordinate pairs \((x, y)\). If `func_1(n)` returns a list of coordinate pairs, the function prints these pairs after processing all test cases. However, if `func_1(n)` does not handle invalid \(n\) values (e.g., \(n < 2\) or \(n > 10^3\)), the function may encounter unexpected behavior or errors, as these conditions are not checked within the given code. Additionally, if `func_1(n)` does not ensure that all coordinate pairs \((x, y)\) are distinct within the same test case, the function will print potentially duplicate coordinates.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem for every potential case described. 

- `func_1` generates a set of points such that the Manhattan distances between them are maximized. It uses a pattern that ensures a diverse set of distances.
- `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each one using `func_1`, and prints the results.

Given the constraints and the need to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, the proposed solution works across all tested cases and examples. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail based on the provided problem description and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
