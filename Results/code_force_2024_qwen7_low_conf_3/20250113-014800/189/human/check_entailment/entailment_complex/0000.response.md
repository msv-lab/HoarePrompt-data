Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. Function `func_1` generates a set of points in the grid using the formula \((i+1, i*2 \% n + 1)\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\).
3. Function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1(n)` to generate the required points and then prints them out.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The formula \((i+1, i*2 \% n + 1)\) ensures that the points are spread across the grid in a manner that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.
- For example, for \(n = 2\), the points generated are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), leading to a set of distances \(\{0, 1\}\).
- This pattern continues for larger \(n\), ensuring that the number of distinct distances is maximized.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` correctly processes each test case by generating the required points using `func_1(n)` and printing them.
- It reads the input from standard input and handles multiple test cases as specified.
- There are no checks for invalid input values of \(n\) (i.e., \(n < 2\) or \(n > 10^3\)), but since the problem constraints specify \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), this should not be an issue within the problem's scope.

### Conclusion:
- Both functions together ensure that the problem requirements are met. The `func_1` generates a set of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for a given \(n\), and `func_2` correctly processes and prints these points for multiple test cases.
- There are no logical errors or missing functionalities in the provided code.
