The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)) and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two elements: the first element is `i + 1` and the second element is `i * 2 % n + 1`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. After the function executes, the final state of the program is that the variable `points` holds the list of tuples described above.
