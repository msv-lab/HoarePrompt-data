    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `points` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the value `(i+1, i*2 % n + 1)` for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `x` is `n+1`, `y` is `2*n % n + 1` which simplifies to `1`.
    return points
    #`points` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the value `(i+1, i*2 % n + 1)` for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)) and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two elements: the first element is `i + 1` and the second element is `i * 2 % n + 1`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. After the function executes, the final state of the program is that the variable `points` holds the list of tuples described above.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. Each (x, y) represents coordinates of a cell in an n × n grid where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, and the coordinates must be distinct for different cells within the same test case.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(data[i + 1])` for each iteration where `i` ranges from `0` to `t-1`, and `result` is the last return value of `func_1(data[i + 1])` added to `results`.
    for result in results:
        for x, y in result:
            print(x, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `results` is a list of tuples, each tuple representing the return values of `func_1(data[i + 1])` for each iteration where `i` ranges from `0` to `t-1`, `result` is the last tuple in the `results` list, `x` is the first element of the last tuple in `results`, and `y` is the second element of the last tuple in `results`, and these values are printed after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\) and multiple coordinate pairs \((x, y)\) in an \(n \times n\) grid. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute some result, which is then stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each coordinate pair \((x, y)\) from the final result of `func_1(n)` for the last test case. The function accepts no direct parameters but reads input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases \(t\), followed by \(t\) lines, each starting with \(n\) and then a series of coordinate pairs \((x, y)\). If `func_1(n)` returns a list of coordinate pairs, the function prints these pairs after processing all test cases. However, if `func_1(n)` does not handle invalid \(n\) values (e.g., \(n < 2\) or \(n > 10^3\)), the function may encounter unexpected behavior or errors, as these conditions are not checked within the given code. Additionally, if `func_1(n)` does not ensure that all coordinate pairs \((x, y)\) are distinct within the same test case, the function will print potentially duplicate coordinates.
