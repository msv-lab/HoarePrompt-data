Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`; `entity` is the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`; `quaffle_carrier` is set to the first element of `action` if `command` is 'C' and `ball` equals '.Q', otherwise `quaffle_carrier` retains its original state; `quaffle_position` and other variables retain their original states unless `cell == 'RG'` or `cell == 'BG'; `entity` is now the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`; `ball` is the third element of `action`.***
