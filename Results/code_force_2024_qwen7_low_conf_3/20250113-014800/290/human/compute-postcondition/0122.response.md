Postcondition: **`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\) where `.Q` is located in `field[i][j]`, `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of `'RG'` in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of `'BG'` in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with `'R'`, `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with `'B'`, `score` remains unchanged, `field` and `actions` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` contains at least one element, `t` is 0, and the action is either `'C'` or `'T'` but not `'R'`. If the action is `'R'`, the second element in the tuple `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` is incremented by 1.**
