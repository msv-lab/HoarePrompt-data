The code prints the value of `t` followed by the uppercase version of `opposite_team` and the word "GOAL". Given the initial state, `t` is 2 and `opposite_team` is 'B' if `scoring_team` is 'R' else 'R'. Since `scoring_team` is 'R', `opposite_team` is 'B'.

After printing, the values of `t` and `opposite_team` remain unchanged, but `score[opposite_team]` (which is `score['B']`) is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R', `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B', `score` is updated such that `score['B']` is incremented by 1, `actions` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `t` is 2, `scoring_team` is 'R', `opposite_team` is 'B', and the output of the print statement is '2 B GOAL'**.
