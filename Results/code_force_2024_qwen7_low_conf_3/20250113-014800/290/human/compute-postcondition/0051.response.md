Postcondition: **`j` is less than `M`, and `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q'. If `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'RG', and `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'BG'. If `field[i][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is an integer, and `players[team][number]` is (i, j). Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
