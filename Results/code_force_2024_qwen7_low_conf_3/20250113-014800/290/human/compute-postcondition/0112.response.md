Postcondition: **`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\) where `.Q` is located in `field[i][j]`, `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of `'RG'` in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of `'BG'` in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with `'R'` in the form `'R<number>'`, `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with `'B'` in the form `'B<number>'`, `score` remains unchanged, `field` and `actions` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` must contain at least one element, `t` is 0, and the action is now 'R'**
