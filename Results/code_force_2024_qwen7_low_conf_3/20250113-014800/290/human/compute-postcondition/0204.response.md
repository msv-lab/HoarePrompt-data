Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`; `entity` is the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`; `quaffle_position` is `(N - 1) // 2, (M - 1) // 2`; `quaffle_carrier` retains its original state unless command is 'C' and ball equals '.Q', in which case `quaffle_carrier` is set to the first element of `action`; if command is 'T', `quaffle_carrier` remains `None`; `cell` is assigned the value of `field[x][y]`; if `cell` is 'BG', `red_score` is increased by 1 and the console prints `t RED GOAL`.***
