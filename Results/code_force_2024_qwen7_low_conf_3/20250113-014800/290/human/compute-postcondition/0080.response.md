`players[team][number]` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. Given that `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the rest of the string from `field[i][j]`, `j` is less than `M`, and `i` is `N-1`, these values remain unchanged. However, the dictionary `players` now contains the key `team` with the value being a dictionary that has `number` mapped to the tuple `(i, j)`.

Output State: **`team` is either 'R' or 'B'; `number` is the rest of the string from `field[i][j]`; `j` is less than `M`; `i` is `N-1`; `players[team][number]` is `(i, j)`**
