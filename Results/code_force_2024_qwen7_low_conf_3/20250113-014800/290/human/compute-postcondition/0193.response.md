Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`; `entity` is the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`; `quaffle_carrier` is `None`; `quaffle_position` and other variables retain their original states unless `cell == 'RG'` or `cell == 'BG'`. If `command` is 'T', `quaffle_carrier` remains `None`.***
