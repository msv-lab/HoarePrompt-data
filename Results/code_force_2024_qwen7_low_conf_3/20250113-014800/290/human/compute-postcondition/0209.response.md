The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:

- `N` and `M` are integers such that \(3 \leq N, M \leq 99\) and both are odd.
- A field represented as a list of `N` strings, where each string contains `M` characters. Each character can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', or '.Q'.
- `P` is an integer such that \(1 \leq P \leq 10\).
- `T` is an integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10000\).
- Actions represented as a list of strings, where each string describes an action performed by an entity on the field.

The function returns a value based on the actions performed on the field, but since no specific output cases are given, the return type is not explicitly defined. However, the function likely modifies the field based on the actions and returns some state or result related to the field after all actions have been processed.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N and M (both integers, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd), a field (a list of N strings, each containing M characters from a set of allowed values), P (an integer, 1 ≤ P ≤ 10), T (an integer, 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000), and a list of actions (strings). It processes the actions on the field and returns a result based on the final state of the field.**
