Postcondition: ***`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\). If `quaffle_position` is in `goals`, then `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R', `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B', `score['B']` is incremented by 1, `actions` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `t` is 2, `scoring_team` is 'R', `opposite_team` is 'B', and the output of the print statement is '2 B GOAL'. If `quaffle_position` is not in `goals`, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition.***
