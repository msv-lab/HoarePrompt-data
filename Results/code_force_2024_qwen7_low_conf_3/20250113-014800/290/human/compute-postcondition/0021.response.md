Postcondition: ***`j` is 0. If `field[i][j]` equals '.Q', then `quaffle_position` is (i, j). Otherwise, `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q'. If `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. If `field[i][j][0]` is 'R' or 'B', then `team` is 'R' or 'B', `number` is a digit from 1 to 9, `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q' and not in ['RG', 'BG'], and `players[team][number]` is [i, 0]. In all other cases, no changes occur.***
