Postcondition: ***`j` is 1 and `i` remains unchanged. If `field[i][j] == '.Q'`, `quaffle_position` is updated to (1, 1), and other conditions specified in the if part are met. If `field[i][j]` is not '.Q' but `field[i][1][0]` is 'R' or 'B', `quaffle_position` is updated if `field[i][1] == '.Q'`, `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is updated if `field[i][1]` is in `['RG', 'BG']`, and `players[team][number]` is updated if `field[i][1][0]` is 'R' or 'B'. Additionally, `goals[field[i][1]]` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][1]` is in `['RG', 'BG']`. If `field[i][1][0]` is neither 'R' nor 'B', no changes are made to `quaffle_position`, `goals['RG']`, `goals['BG']`, and `players[team][number]`.***
