Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `M`, `i` is an integer. If `field[i][j]` is `'RG'` or `'BG'`, then `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. If `field[i][j]` is `'R'` or `'B'`, then `team` is set to the value of `field[i][j]`, `number` is set to the value of `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is set to `(i, j)`. If `field[i][j]` is `'.'Q'`, `quaffle_position` is set to `(i, j)`. No other changes occur in any case.***
