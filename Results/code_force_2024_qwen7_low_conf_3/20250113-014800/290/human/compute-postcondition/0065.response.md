The code `players[team][number] = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the indices `team` and `number` in the `players` dictionary. The values of `i`, `j`, `team`, and `number` remain unchanged, but now `players[team][number]` contains the coordinates `(i, j)`.

Output State: **`j` is less than `M`, `i` is an integer, `field[i][j+1]` is either `'.'`, `'RG'`, `'BG'`, `'R'`, or `'B'`, `team` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `number` is the value of `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is `(i, j)`.**
