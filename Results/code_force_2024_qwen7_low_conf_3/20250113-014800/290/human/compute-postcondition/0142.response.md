Postcondition: **`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R', `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B', `score` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `t` is 2. If `action == 'R'`, the count of one player in `players['R']` increases by 1. If `action == 'C'`, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition. If `action == 'T'`, `quaffle_position` is updated to the position of the player specified by `entity`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition.**
