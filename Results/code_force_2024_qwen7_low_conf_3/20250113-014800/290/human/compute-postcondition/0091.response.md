Postcondition: ***`j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of \( j \) + 1, `i` is \( N-1 \). If the element at position \([i][j]\) in `field` is '.Q', then `quaffle_position` is `(i, j)`. Otherwise, if the element at position \([i][j]\) is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. If the first character of `field[i][j]` is 'R' or 'B', then `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the numeric part of 'R' or 'B', and `players[team][number]` is \((N-1, \text{previous value of } j + 1)\). Otherwise, `team` remains unchanged as '.', `number` remains 0, and `players` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged in all cases.***
