Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`; `entity` is the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`. 

- If `command` is 'C' and `ball` equals '.Q', then `quaffle_carrier` is set to the first element of `action`, and `quaffle_position` and other variables retain their original states unless `cell == 'RG'` or `cell == 'BG'`.
- If `command` is 'C' and `ball` does not equal '.Q', or `command` is anything other than 'C', then `quaffle_carrier` retains its original state.
- If `command` is 'T', then `quaffle_carrier` remains `None`.
- `quaffle_position` and other variables retain their original states unless `cell == 'RG'` or `cell == 'BG'.`***
