`goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `field[i][j+1]` does not change, and the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`j` is less than `M`, `i` is an integer, and `field[i][j+1]` is either `'.'`, `'RG'`, `'BG'`, `'R'`, or `'B'`; `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1**
