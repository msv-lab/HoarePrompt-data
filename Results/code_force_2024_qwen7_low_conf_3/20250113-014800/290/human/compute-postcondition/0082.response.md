Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `M`, `i` is `N-1`. The element at position `[i][j]` in `field` is not equal to '.Q'. If the element is in ['RG', 'BG'], `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the first character of `field[i][j]` is 'R' or 'B', then `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the rest of the string from `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is set to `(i, j)`. Otherwise, `team` and `number` remain unchanged.***
