The code initializes a dictionary `goals` with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'` and both values set to `0`. This does not affect the values of `N`, `M`, `T`, `field`, `actions`, or `quaffle_position`. Therefore, the only change is in the `goals` dictionary.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, `field` is a list of N lists, each containing M strings; `actions` is a list of T lists, each containing input strings; `quaffle_position` is `None`; `goals` = {'RG': 0, 'BG': 0}**
