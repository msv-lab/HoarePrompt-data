Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`; `entity` is the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`; if `quaffle_carrier` is equal to `entity`, `quaffle_position` is updated to `(x, y)` based on the `command` and `entity`, and `quaffle_carrier` retains its original state; otherwise, `quaffle_position` is updated to `(x, y)` based on the `command` and `entity`, and `quaffle_carrier` remains unchanged.***
