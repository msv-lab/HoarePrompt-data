`T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `T` now holds the integer input from the user. The values of `N`, `M`, `T`, and the `field` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, and `field` is a list of N lists, each containing M strings; `T` is the integer input from the user.**
