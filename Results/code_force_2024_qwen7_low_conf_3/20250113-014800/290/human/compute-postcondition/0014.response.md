`goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `field[i][j]` can be either 'RG' or 'BG', so `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` will be incremented by 1. The value of `j` remains 0, and the condition that `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q' is still valid.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG' and `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1.**
