Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `M`, `i` is `N-1`, and the element at position `[i][j]` in `field` is not in ['RG', 'BG']. If the first character of `field[i][j]` is 'R' or 'B', then `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the rest of the string from `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is `(i, j)`. Otherwise, `team` and `number` remain unchanged.***
