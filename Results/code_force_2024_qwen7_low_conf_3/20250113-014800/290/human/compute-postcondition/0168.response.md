The code prints a formatted string using the values of `t` (which is not defined in the initial state or within the code snippet) and `opposite_team.upper()`. Since `opposite_team` is 'R', `opposite_team.upper()` will be 'R'. The value of `t` is not specified, so it will remain as it is in the output. However, no variables are assigned new values in this code snippet, only a print statement is executed.

Output State: **`scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` is 'R', `score['R']` is 1, print statement outputs 't R GOAL'**
