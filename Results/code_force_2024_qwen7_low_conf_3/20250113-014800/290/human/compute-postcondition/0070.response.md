According to the code, the loop iterates over each row of the `field` matrix, starting from the beginning and moving downwards. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `M` and `i` is an integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `j` is less than `M`
- `i` is an integer

The loop will continue to the next iteration if both conditions are met. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `M`, and `i` must be incremented to the next row (i.e., `i + 1`).

Given that the loop completes after `i` reaches `N-1` and `j` reaches `M-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented to `N-1` and `j` is reset to `0` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`j` is 0, `i` is N-1**
