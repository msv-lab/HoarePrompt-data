Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `M`, `i` is an integer, and `field[i][j+1]` is either `'.'`, `'RG'`, `'BG'`, `'R'`, or `'B'`. If `field[i][j][0]` is either `'R'` or `'B'`, then `team` is either `'.'`, `'RG'`, `'BG'`, `'R'`, or `'B'`, and `number` is either `''`, `players[team][number]` is `(i, j)`. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.***
