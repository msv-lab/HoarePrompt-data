The given code initializes the variable `quaffle_position` based on the values of `N` and `M`. However, the initial values of `N` and `M` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `quaffle_position`. But we can express `quaffle_position` in terms of `N` and `M`.

- `scoring_team` is 'B', which remains unchanged.
- `opposite_team` is 'R', which also remains unchanged.
- `score['R']` is 1, which remains unchanged.
- `quaffle_position` is calculated as `(N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1`.

Since `N` and `M` are not specified, we keep them as they are.

Output State: **`scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` is 'R', `score['R']` is 1, `quaffle_position` is (`(N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1`)**
