Postcondition: ***`i` is \( N-1 \); `j` is the previous value of `j` + 1 (still less than \( M \)); `team` is either '.', 'R', 'B', or 'Q'; `number` is the numeric part of 'R' or 'B' string or 0 if '.Q', 'RG', 'BG'; `players[team][number]` is \((N-1, \text{previous value of } j + 1)\) if the first character of `field[i][j]` is 'R' or 'B'. The values of `i`, `j`, `team`, `number`, and `players` remain unchanged if the first character of `field[i][j]` is not 'R' or 'B'.***
