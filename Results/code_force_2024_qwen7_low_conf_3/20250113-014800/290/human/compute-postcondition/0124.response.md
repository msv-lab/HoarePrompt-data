Postcondition: ***`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\) where `.Q` is located in `field[i][j]`, `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of `'RG'` in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of `'BG'` in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with `'R'`, `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with `'B'`, `score` remains unchanged, `field` and `actions` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` contains at least one element, `t` is 0. If the action is 'D', the position of the specified player is updated as `(players[entity[0]][entity[1]][0] + 1, players[entity[1]])`. Otherwise, the position of player 'R1' is updated to `(i, j-1)` if the action is 'L', or the second element in the tuple `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` is incremented by 1 if the action is 'C' or 'T'.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that the state of the program variables is accurately described after the execution of the conditional block.
