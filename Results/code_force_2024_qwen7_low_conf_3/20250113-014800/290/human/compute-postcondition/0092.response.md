Let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of \( j \) + 1
  - `i` is \( N-1 \)
- The loop increments `j` from 0 to \( M-1 \).
- The loop body modifies `quaffle_position`, `goals`, `team`, `number`, and `players` based on the element at position `[i][j]` in `field`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to \( M-1 \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition**: At the start of the loop, `j` starts from 0 (since `j` is incremented within the loop).
2. **Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was equal to the previous value of `j` + 1, and it was less than \( M \).
3. **Current Iteration**:
   - `j` is now incremented by 1.
   - `i` remains \( N-1 \).

### State Adjustments:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` is the previous value of `j` + 2.
- `i` remains unchanged and still equals \( N-1 \).

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the new state should reflect the updated value of `j`.

**State:**
- `j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of `j` + 2.
- `i` is \( N-1 \).

Therefore, the updated state is:
**`j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of \( j \) + 2, `i` is \( N-1`**.
