Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`; `entity` is the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`; `quaffle_carrier` retains its original state unless `command` is 'C' and `ball` equals '.Q', in which case `quaffle_carrier` is set to the first element of `action`; `quaffle_position` and other variables retain their original states unless `cell == 'RG'` or `cell == 'BG'; `x` is the x coordinate corresponding to `entity` in `positions`; `y` is the y coordinate corresponding to `entity` in `positions`. If `command == 'L'`, `y` is decremented by 1; if `command == 'R'`, `y` is incremented by 1.**
