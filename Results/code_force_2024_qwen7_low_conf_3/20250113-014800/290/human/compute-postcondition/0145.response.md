Postcondition: ***`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R', `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B', `score` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `t` is 2. If `action == 'U'`, the x-coordinate of the specified player's position in the `players` dictionary is decreased by 1. Otherwise, depending on the value of `action`, the state of the program changes as follows: if `action == 'D'`, the position of the player named 'Alice' is updated to \((i+1, j+1)\); if `action == 'L'`, the position of the player whose name starts with `entity[0]` and whose position was accessed by `entity[1]` is updated to \((row, column-1)\); if `action == 'R'`, the count of one player in `players['R']` increases by 1; if `action == 'C'`, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition; if `action == 'T'`, `quaffle_position` is updated to the position of the player specified by `entity`; otherwise, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition.***
