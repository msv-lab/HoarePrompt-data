The code `goals[field[i][j]] += 1` increments the value of `goals[field[i][j]]` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of `j` + 2, and `i` is \( N-1 \). The value of `field[i][j]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can state that `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of `j` + 2, `i` is \( N-1 \), `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1.**
