Postcondition: ***`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` remain unchanged, `players['R']` and `players['B']` remain unchanged, `score['B']` remains unchanged, `actions` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `t` is 3, `scoring_team` is 'B', and `opposite_team` is 'R'. If the action is 'U', the position of the player identified by `entity[0]` and `entity[1]` is updated to \((players[entity[0]][entity[1]][0] - 1, players[entity[1]][entity[1]][1])\). If the action is 'D', the player at `entity[0]` and `entity[1]` is updated to \((players[entity[0]][entity[1]][0] + 1, players[entity[1]][entity[1]][1] + 1)\). If the action is 'L', one player's stamina is decremented. If the action is 'R', the second element of the tuple in `players[entity[0]]` for the key `entity[1]` is incremented by 1. If the action is 'T', `quaffle_position` is updated to `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` and the second element of the tuple in `players[entity[0]]` for the key `entity[1]` is incremented by 1. If the action is neither 'R' nor 'C', the output of the print statement is undefined.***
