The code assigns a value to `opposite_team` based on the condition `scoring_team == 'R'`. Given the initial state where `scoring_team` is 'B', the condition `scoring_team == 'R'` evaluates to False. Therefore, the value of `opposite_team` is assigned 'R'.

Output State: **`scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` is 'R'**
