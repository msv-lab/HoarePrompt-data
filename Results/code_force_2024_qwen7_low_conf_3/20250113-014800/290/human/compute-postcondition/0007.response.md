The code initializes the `score` dictionary with keys 'R' and 'B', both set to 0. This does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, `field` is a list of N lists, each containing M strings; `actions` is a list of T lists, each containing input strings; `quaffle_position` is `None`; `goals` = {'RG': 0, 'BG': 0}; `players` = {'R': {}, 'B': {}}; `score` = {'R': 0, 'B': 0}**
