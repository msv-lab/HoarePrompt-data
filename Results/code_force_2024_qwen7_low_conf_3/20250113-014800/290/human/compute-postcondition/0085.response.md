The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `quaffle_position`. This means `quaffle_position` is now a tuple containing the values of `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of \( j \) + 1, `i` is \( N-1 \), `quaffle_position` is `(i, j)`**
