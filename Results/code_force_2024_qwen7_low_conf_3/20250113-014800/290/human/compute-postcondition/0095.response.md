`team, number` are assigned the values from `field[i][j]`. Since `i` is \(N-1\) and `j` is less than \(M\) and equals the previous value of `j` + 2, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but `team` and `number` now hold the values from `field[i][j]`.

Output State: **`i` is \(N-1\), `j` is less than \(M\) and equals the previous value of `j` + 2, `team` is the value from `field[i][j][0]`, `number` is the value from `field[i][j][1]`**
