Postcondition: **`i` is \(N-1\), `j` is less than \(M\) and equals the previous value of `j` + 2. If `field[i][j][0]` is in ['R', 'B'], then `team` is the value from `field[i][j][0]`, `number` is the value from `field[i][j][1]`, and `players[team][number]` is \([i, j]\). Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
