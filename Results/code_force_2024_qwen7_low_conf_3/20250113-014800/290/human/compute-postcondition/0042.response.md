`quaffle_position` is assigned the value `(i, j)`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The condition that `j` is less than `M` and the current value of `field[i][j]` is `'.'` is still valid.

Output State: **`j` is less than `M` and the current value of `field[i][j]` is '.', `i` is an integer, `quaffle_position` is (i, j)**
