`players[team][number]` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. This means that the values of `i` and `j` are stored in `players[team][number]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code, but we need to note that `j` is now less than `M` and `team` is either 'R' or 'B', and `number` is an integer.

Output State: **`j` is less than `M`; `team` is either 'R' or 'B'; `number` is an integer; `players[team][number]` is (i, j)**
