Postcondition: ***`j` is 2 and `i` remains unchanged. If `field[i][2]` is in `['RG', 'BG']`, `goals[field[i][2]]` is incremented by 1. If `field[i][2][0]` is 'R' or 'B', `quaffle_position` is updated to (1, 1), `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` are updated, and `players[team][number]` is updated to `(i, 2)`. If `field[i][2][0]` is neither 'R' nor 'B', `quaffle_position`, `goals['RG']`, `goals['BG']`, and `players[team][number]` remain unchanged.***
