The code `quaffle_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle_position`. This means that the values of `i` and `j` are stored in `quaffle_position`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` must be less than `M`, `i` is `N-1`; `quaffle_position` is `(i, j)`**
