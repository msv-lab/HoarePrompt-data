Output State: **`j` is less than `M`, `i` is an integer. If `field[i][j]` is `'.'Q'`, then `quaffle_position` is set to `(i, j)`. If `field[i][j]` is `'RG'` or `'BG'`, then `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` are incremented by the count of occurrences of `'RG'` and `'BG'` respectively. If `field[i][j]` is `'R'` or `'B'`, then `team` is set to `'R'` or `'B'`, `number` is an integer, and `players[team][number]` is set to `(i, j)`. After the loop completes, `j` will be `M-1` and `i` will be `N-1`, and no further changes will be made to the variables unless explicitly modified within the loop.**
