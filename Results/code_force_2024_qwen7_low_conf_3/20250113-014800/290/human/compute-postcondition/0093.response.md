The code sets `quaffle_position` to the tuple `(i, j)`. Given the initial state, `i` is \(N-1\) and `j` is less than \(M\) and equals the previous value of `j` + 2. After the code executes, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but `quaffle_position` is now a tuple containing these values.

Output State: **`i` is \(N-1\), `j` is less than \(M\) and equals the previous value of `j` + 2, `quaffle_position` is \((i, j)\)**
