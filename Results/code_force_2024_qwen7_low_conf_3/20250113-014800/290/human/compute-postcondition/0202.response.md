The code snippet `print(f'{t} RED GOAL')` prints a string but does not affect the values of any variables. The values of `T`, `action`, `entity`, `command`, `quaffle_position`, `quaffle_carrier`, `cell`, `red_score` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`; `entity` is the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`; `quaffle_position` is (x, y); `quaffle_carrier` retains its original state unless command is 'C' and ball equals '.Q', in which case `quaffle_carrier` is set to the first element of `action`; if command is 'T', `quaffle_carrier` remains `None`; `cell` is assigned the value of `field[x][y]`; `red_score` is increased by 1; the console prints `t RED GOAL`.**
