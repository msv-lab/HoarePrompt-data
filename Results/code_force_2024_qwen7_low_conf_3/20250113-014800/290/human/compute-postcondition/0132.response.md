Postcondition: ***`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R', `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B', `score` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` contains at least one element, `t` is 0. If `quaffle_position` is in `goals`, the score for team 'B' is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
