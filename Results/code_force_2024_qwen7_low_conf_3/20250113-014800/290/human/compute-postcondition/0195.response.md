Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`; `entity` is the first element of `action`; `command` is the second element of `action`. If `command` is in 'UDLR', `quaffle_position` is updated to `(x, y)` based on the `command` and `entity`, and `quaffle_carrier` retains its original state unless `command` is 'C' and `ball` equals '.Q', in which case `quaffle_carrier` is set to the first element of `action`. If `command` is 'C' and `ball` does not equal '.Q', or `command` is anything other than 'C', then `quaffle_carrier` retains its original state. If `command` is 'T', `quaffle_carrier` remains `None`. `quaffle_position` and other variables retain their original states unless `cell == 'RG'` or `cell == 'BG'.***
