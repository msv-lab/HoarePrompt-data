The code `print(f'{t} {opposite_team.upper()} GOAL')` prints the current value of `t` followed by the uppercase version of `opposite_team` concatenated with the string " GOAL". 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 0
- `opposite_team` is 'R'

The output of the print statement will be `0 R GOAL`.

However, this output does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`quaffle_position` is a tuple (i, j) where .Q is located in field[i][j], `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in field, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in field, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R', `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B', `score` is updated such that `score['R']` is increased by 1, `field` and `actions` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` contains at least one element, `t` is 0, `scoring_team` is 'B', and `opposite_team` is 'R'.**
