`goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', so `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`j` must be less than `M`, `i` is `N-1`, the element at position `[i][j]` in `field` is not equal to '.Q', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1**
