Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `N` and `M` representing the dimensions of a game field, `field` which is a list of strings representing the state of the field, `P` (though `P` is not used in the function), `T` representing the number of actions to process, and a list of actions. The function processes these actions on the game field and determines the final score based on the number of goals scored by the blue and red teams. The function updates the positions of entities on the field, handles goal scoring, and prints the final score.**

**The function performs the following actions:**
- Reads the input from standard input.
- Parses the field dimensions and the field itself.
- Initializes scores and positions for entities.
- Processes each action, updating positions and handling goal scoring.
- Prints the final score after processing all actions.

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If the field dimensions `N` and `M` are not within the specified range (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd), the function does not handle this case explicitly. This could lead to undefined behavior.
- The parameter `P` is mentioned but not used in the function, indicating that its inclusion might be unnecessary or incorrect.
- The function does not validate the input data for consistency (e.g., ensuring all required entities and actions are present).
- The function does not handle invalid commands or actions (e.g., out-of-bound movements or invalid entity names).
- The function assumes that the initial positions of entities and the initial state of the field are correctly parsed. If the parsing fails, the function might produce incorrect results.
- The function does not account for scenarios where the quaffle carrier is not set properly or where actions lead to undefined states (e.g., moving off the field boundary).

After the function concludes, the final state of the program includes:
- `red_score` and `blue_score` representing the total number of goals scored by the red and blue teams, respectively.
- `quaffle_position` indicating the final position of the quaffle on the field.
- `quaffle_carrier` indicating the last entity that carried the quaffle.
- `positions` dictionary mapping entities to their final positions on the field.
