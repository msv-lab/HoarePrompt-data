Postcondition: ***`j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of \( j \) + 1, `i` is \( N-1 \). If the element at position \([i][j]\) in `field` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `team` is either '.', 'R', 'B', or 'Q'; `number` is the numeric part of 'R' or 'B' string or 0 if '.Q', 'RG', 'BG'; `players[team][number]` is \((N-1, \text{previous value of } j + 1)\) if the first character of `field[i][j]` is 'R' or 'B'. The values of `i`, `j`, `team`, `number`, and `players` remain unchanged if the first character of `field[i][j]` is not 'R' or 'B'.***
