The code `goals[field[i][j]] += 1` increments the value of `goals[field[i][j]]` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `j` is less than `M`
- `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q'
- The current value of `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG'

Since `field[i][j]` can be either 'RG' or 'BG', we need to consider both cases:

1. If `field[i][j]` is 'RG', then `goals['RG']` will be incremented by 1.
2. If `field[i][j]` is 'BG', then `goals['BG']` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated states for the `goals` dictionary will reflect this increment. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`j` is less than `M`, `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q', the current value of `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'RG', and `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'BG'.**
