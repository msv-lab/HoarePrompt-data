Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `M`, `i` is an integer, and `field[i][j]` is either '.' or a specific marker. If `field[i][j]` is '.', then `quaffle_position` is (i, j). If `field[i][j]` is 'RG' or 'BG', then the corresponding goal count (`goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']`) is incremented by 1. If `field[i][j][0]` is 'R' or 'B', then `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is an integer, and `players[team][number]` is updated to (i, j). Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
