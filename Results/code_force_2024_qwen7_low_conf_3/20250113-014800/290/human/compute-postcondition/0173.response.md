The function `func_1` accepts a parameter that is a list of N strings, where N is an integer such that 3 ≤ N ≤ 99 and N is odd. Each string contains M characters, where M is an integer such that 3 ≤ M ≤ 99 and M is odd. The field is represented by characters such as ".." (empty cell), "R0"-"R9", "B0"-"B9" (players of Gryffindor or Ravenclaw team), "RG" or "BG" (goal), or ".Q" (Quaffle). Additionally, it accepts another parameter T, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each action in the game is described as a string containing a pair of characters (representing the entity performing the action) followed by a space and then a command (U, D, L, R, C, T) indicating the action type.

Based on the provided information, the function does not explicitly return anything, but it likely processes the game actions and updates the field state accordingly over T steps.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of N strings representing a field, where N is an integer such that 3 ≤ N ≤ 99 and N is odd, and M is an integer such that 3 ≤ M ≤ 99 and M is odd. It also accepts an integer T such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each action in the game is described as a string containing a pair of characters followed by a command. The function processes the game actions and updates the field state over T steps.**
