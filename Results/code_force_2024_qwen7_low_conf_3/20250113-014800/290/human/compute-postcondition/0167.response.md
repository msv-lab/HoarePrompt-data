The code `score[opposite_team] += 1` increments the value of the key `opposite_team` in the dictionary `score` by 1. Given the initial state where `opposite_team` is 'R', this means that the score for team 'R' is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` is 'R', `score['R']` is 1**
