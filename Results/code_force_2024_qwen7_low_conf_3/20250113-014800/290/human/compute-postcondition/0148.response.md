`score[opposite_team]` is incremented by 1. The value of `opposite_team` is determined based on the value of `scoring_team`. If `scoring_team` is 'R', then `opposite_team` is 'B', and vice versa. Since `score` is updated based on `opposite_team`, the value of `score['B']` will increase by 1 if `scoring_team` is 'R', and the value of `score['R']` will increase by 1 if `scoring_team` is 'B'. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:
**`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R', `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B', `score` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `actions` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `t` is 2, `scoring_team` is `'R'` if `quaffle_position` is in `['BG']` else `'B'`, `opposite_team` is 'B' if `scoring_team` is 'R' else 'R', `score[opposite_team]` is incremented by 1**.
