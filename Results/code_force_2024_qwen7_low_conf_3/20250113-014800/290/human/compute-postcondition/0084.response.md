Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - \( j \) is less than \( M \)
   - \( i \) is \( N-1 \)
   - The element at position \([i][j]\) in `field` is either '.Q', 'RG', 'BG', or a string starting with 'R' or 'B'.
     - If the element is '.Q', the condition `field[i][j] == '.Q'` is met.
     - If the element is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1.
     - If the element starts with 'R' or 'B', `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the rest of the string from `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is set to `(i, j)`.
     - Otherwise, `team` and `number` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**: For the current iteration, the loop variable \( j \) is being incremented by 1.

3. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, \( j \) must still be less than \( M \).
   - Since \( j \) is incremented by 1, \( j \) must be equal to the value it was in the previous iteration plus 1.
   - \( i \) remains \( N-1 \) because the loop variable \( j \) does not affect \( i \).

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - \( j \) must be equal to the previous value of \( j \) + 1.
   - \( i \) remains \( N-1 \).
   - The element at position \([i][j]\) in `field` must still meet one of the conditions mentioned above (either '.Q', 'RG', 'BG', or a string starting with 'R' or 'B').

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is less than \( M \) and equals the previous value of \( j \) + 1, `i` is \( N-1 \), the element at position \([i][j]\) in `field` is either '.Q', 'RG', 'BG', or a string starting with 'R' or 'B'.**
