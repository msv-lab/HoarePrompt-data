Postcondition: **`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` remain unchanged, `players['R']` and `players['B']` remain unchanged, `score['B']` remains unchanged, `actions` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, `t` is 3, `scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` is 'R', and the output of the print statement is undefined. If the action is 'C', no changes occur. If the action is 'T', `quaffle_position` is updated to `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]`.**
