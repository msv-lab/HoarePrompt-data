The code `field = [input().split() for _ in range(N)]` reads `N` lines of input, where each line is split into a list of strings, and stores these lists into the `field` variable. This means that `field` is now a list of lists (a matrix), with each inner list representing a row in the matrix, and the length of each inner list being `M`. The values of `N` and `M` remain unchanged, and `T` is not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `M` are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, and `field` is a list of N lists, each containing M strings, where the values of `N` and `M` are the same as the input values and `field` is populated according to the input.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, and `field` is a list of N lists, each containing M strings, where the values of `N` and `M` are the same as the input values and `field` is populated according to the input.**
