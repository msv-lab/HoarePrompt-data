Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `M`, `i` is `N-1`. The element at position `[i][j]` in `field` is either '.Q', 'RG', 'BG', or a string starting with 'R' or 'B'. If the element is '.Q', then the condition `field[i][j] == '.Q'` is met. If the element is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. If the element starts with 'R' or 'B', `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the rest of the string from `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is set to `(i, j)`. Otherwise, `team` and `number` remain unchanged.***
