State: **`j` must be less than M, `i` is N-1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The for loop is defined as `for j in range(M)`.
2. The condition for executing the loop is that `j` must be within the range specified by `range(M)`.
3. The range function `range(M)` generates values from 0 to M-1.
4. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` must be less than M.
5. The initial state of `j` is given as 0, which satisfies the condition `j < M` if M is at least 1.
6. The initial state of `i` is given as N-1, but this variable is not directly related to the loop's condition and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Hence, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `j` is less than M.
