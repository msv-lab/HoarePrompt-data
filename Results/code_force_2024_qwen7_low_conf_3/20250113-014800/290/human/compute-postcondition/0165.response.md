Given the initial state, `quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), and from the code snippet:

```python
scoring_team = 'R' if quaffle_position in ['BG'] else 'B'
```

We need to evaluate the condition `quaffle_position in ['BG']`. Since `quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\) and not a string, the condition `quaffle_position in ['BG']` will always be false because `['BG']` contains strings, and `quaffle_position` is a tuple.

Therefore, the value of `scoring_team` will be set to `'B'`.

The output state will reflect this change:

Output State: **`scoring_team` is 'B'**
