#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M characters. Each pair of characters on the field can be one of the following: ".." (empty cell), "R0"-"R9", "B0"-"B9" (player of Gryffindor or Ravenclaw team), "RG" or "BG" (goal), or ".Q" (Quaffle). T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each action in the game is described as a string containing a pair of characters (representing the entity performing the action) followed by a space and then a command (U, D, L, R, C, T) indicating the action type.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    #1. **Initial State**:
    #   - `quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\).
    #   - `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in `field`.
    #   - `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in `field`.
    #   - `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R'.
    #   - `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B'.
    #   - `score` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop.
    #   - `field` and `actions` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop.
    #   - `actions` contains at least one element.
    #   - `t` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each action in `actions`.
    #   - For each action, it updates the positions of the players based on the action type ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').
    #   - It checks if the updated `quaffle_position` is in `goals`. If it is, the scoring logic is applied.
    #   - If `quaffle_position` is in `goals`, the scoring team is determined and the score is updated.
    #   - If `quaffle_position` is not in `goals`, the state remains unchanged.
    #
    #3. **Final State Analysis**:
    #   - After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be the length of `actions` minus one (since `t` starts from 0 and increments by 1 per iteration).
    #   - The `quaffle_position` can be any position in `field` depending on the actions performed by the players.
    #   - The `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` counts will not change unless the quaffle enters a goal position.
    #   - The `players['R']` and `players['B']` dictionaries will reflect the final positions of the players after all actions.
    #   - The `score` dictionary will reflect the number of goals scored by either team.
    #   - `field` and `actions` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #Since the loop iterates through all actions and updates the positions of the players and potentially the score, we need to consider the final state after all possible actions have been processed.
    #
    #- `quaffle_position` can be any valid position in `field` after all actions.
    #- `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` remain unchanged unless the quaffle enters a goal position during the loop.
    #- `players['R']` and `players['B']` reflect the final positions of the players.
    #- `score` reflects the number of goals scored by either team, but not both teams simultaneously.
    #- `field` and `actions` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop.
    #
    #Given these considerations, the final output state is:
    #
    #**Output State: **`quaffle_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\), `goals['RG']` is the count of occurrences of 'RG' in `field`, `goals['BG']` is the count of occurrences of 'BG' in `field`, `players['R']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'R', `players['B']` is a dictionary containing the positions of all players whose names start with 'B', `score` reflects the number of goals scored by either team, `field` and `actions` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, `t` is the length of `actions` minus one.
    print(f"FINAL SCORE: {score['R']} {score['B']}")
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a game simulation for a simplified Quidditch match between two teams, Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. It accepts a field representation as a list of strings, along with the dimensions of the field (N and M), and a sequence of actions (T actions) that describe movements and scoring events. The function updates the positions of the players and the Quaffle (represented by a special character) according to the given actions. The function also tracks the goals scored by each team and prints the final score. The final state of the program includes the updated positions of players, the count of goals scored by each team, and the position of the Quaffle, while the original field and actions remain unchanged unless modified within the loop. Potential edge cases include invalid actions (e.g., out-of-bounds movement) and unmodified field and actions if no changes are made during the loop. The function does not handle situations where the Quaffle moves into a non-goal position; instead, it resets the Quaffle to a neutral position after a goal is scored.
