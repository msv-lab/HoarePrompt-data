Precondition: **N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M characters. Each pair of characters on the field can be one of the following: ".." (empty cell), "R0"-"R9", "B0"-"B9" (player of Gryffindor or Ravenclaw team), "RG" or "BG" (goal), or ".Q" (Quaffle). T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each action in the game is described as a string containing a pair of characters (representing the entity performing the action) followed by a space and then a command (U, D, L, R, C, T) indicating the action type.**
