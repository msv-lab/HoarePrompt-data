N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters. The first line of the input contains N lines of M pairs of characters separated by spaces. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. The next T lines describe the actions performed by the entities on the field, with each action being a string of characters as described in the problem statement. The input ensures that all actions are valid.
