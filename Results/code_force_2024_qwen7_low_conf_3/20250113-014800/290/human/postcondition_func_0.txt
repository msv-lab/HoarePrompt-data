The function processes a game simulation for a simplified Quidditch match between two teams, Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. It accepts a field representation as a list of strings, along with the dimensions of the field (N and M), and a sequence of actions (T actions) that describe movements and scoring events. The function updates the positions of the players and the Quaffle (represented by a special character) according to the given actions. The function also tracks the goals scored by each team and prints the final score. The final state of the program includes the updated positions of players, the count of goals scored by each team, and the position of the Quaffle, while the original field and actions remain unchanged unless modified within the loop. Potential edge cases include invalid actions (e.g., out-of-bounds movement) and unmodified field and actions if no changes are made during the loop. The function does not handle situations where the Quaffle moves into a non-goal position; instead, it resets the Quaffle to a neutral position after a goal is scored.
