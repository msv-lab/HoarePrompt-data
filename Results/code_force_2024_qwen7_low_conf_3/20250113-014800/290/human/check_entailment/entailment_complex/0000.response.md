Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the initial state of the field, including the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
2. The program iterates through each action, updating the positions of players and checking for scoring conditions.
3. When a player scores by placing the Quaffle in the opponent's goal, the program correctly identifies the scoring team and updates the score.
4. The program correctly handles the reset of the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
5. The final score is calculated and printed accurately based on the number of goals scored by each team.

The provided code meets the requirements of the problem statement and correctly simulates the game. It properly handles the movement of players, scoring, and resetting the Quaffle. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
