Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, scoring in the wrong goal should result in the other team winning a point. However, the program does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the program only checks if the Quaffle is placed in a goal and increments the score of the opposing team without considering whether the player who threw the Quaffle belongs to the team that owns that goal.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

In this case, the red player scores in the red goal, which should give the blue team a point according to the rules. However, the current implementation does not detect this scenario and does not award the point to the blue team. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for this specific case.
