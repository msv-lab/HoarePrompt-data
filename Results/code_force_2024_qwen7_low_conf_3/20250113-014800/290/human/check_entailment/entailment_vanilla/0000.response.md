Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`N` and `M`), initializes the field representation, and processes the number of steps `T` and the sequence of actions for each step.

2. **Field Initialization**:
   - The program correctly identifies the initial positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - Goals are stored in a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'` representing Red and Blue goals respectively.

3. **Action Processing**:
   - The program handles player movements (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) by updating their positions in the `players` dictionary.
   - Player actions are processed appropriately:
     - `'C'` (catch): No action is taken since catching is not required to update the score.
     - `'T'` (throw): The Quaffle's position is updated to the player's current position.
   
4. **Scoring Logic**:
   - When the Quaffle reaches a goal, the program correctly determines the scoring team and the opposing team.
   - The score is incremented for the opposing team, and the program prints the relevant message.
   - The Quaffle is then reset to the middle of the field.

5. **Final Score Output**:
   - After processing all actions, the final score is printed in the format `FINAL SCORE: r b`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the rules and logic specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
