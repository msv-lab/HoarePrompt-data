Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly simulates the Quidditch game as described in the problem statement.
- The program initializes the field and reads the initial positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
- It processes each action step-by-step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle accordingly.
- When a player scores by placing the Quaffle in the opposing team's goal, the program correctly identifies the scoring team, prints the appropriate message, and updates the score.
- After processing all actions, the program prints the final score.
- The program does not modify the original field and actions unless explicitly changed within the loop, which is consistent with the problem requirements.
- The program handles the necessary conditions for scoring and resetting the Quaffle after a goal is scored.
- There are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the program to behave incorrectly, based on the provided summary.

Correctness: **True**
