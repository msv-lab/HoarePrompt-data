You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    if zero_count == 0:
        return n
    max_k = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if zero_count % k == 0:
            max_k = k
    return max_k

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        result = func_1(n, s)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of cases), an integer `n` (length of a binary string `s`), and a binary string `s` itself. It then processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, s)` to obtain a result for each case, stores these results in a list `results`, and finally prints each result. The function ensures that it correctly handles the input for up to 10,000 test cases, with each binary string having a maximum length of 5,000 characters. If the input format is incorrect or incomplete, the function will still attempt to process as much valid input as possible.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the maximum value of \( k \) that allows making all characters in the string equal to '1'. The function `func_1` attempts to find the maximum \( k \) such that the number of '0's in the string is divisible by \( k \). However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that all '0's can be flipped to '1's using the described operations.

For instance, consider the input:
- Length \( n = 5 \)
- String \( s = 00100 \)

The function `func_1` returns \( k = 3 \), but let's analyze why this is incorrect:
- If we choose \( k = 3 \) and flip the substring from the 1st to the 3rd character, we get \( s = 11100 \).
- Next, if we choose \( k = 2 \) and flip the substring from the 3rd to the 5th character, we get \( s = 11111 \).

This sequence of flips works correctly, so \( k = 3 \) is valid. However, the function incorrectly returns the largest divisor of the number of '0's, which is 3 in this case.

Another counterexample is:
- Length \( n = 5 \)
- String \( s = 01000 \)

The function `func_1` returns \( k = 2 \), but let's analyze why this is incorrect:
- If we choose \( k = 2 \) and flip the substring from the 1st to the 2nd character, we get \( s = 11000 \).
- There is no way to flip the remaining '0's to '1's using any \( k \) since flipping any substring will not affect the last '0'.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
