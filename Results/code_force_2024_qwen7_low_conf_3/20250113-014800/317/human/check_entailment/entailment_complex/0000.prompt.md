You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the binary string s, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    if (zero_count == 0) :
        return n
        #The program returns `n`, which represents the length of the binary string `s`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and `zero_count` is the count of '0's in `s`. The zero_count is not equal to 0
    max_k = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if zero_count % k == 0:
            max_k = k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `zero_count` is the count of '0's in `s`, and `max_k` is the largest integer `k` such that `zero_count % k == 0`, or 1 if no such `k` exists.
    return max_k
    #The program returns `max_k`, which is the largest integer `k` such that `zero_count % k == 0`, or 1 if no such `k` exists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`) and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'). It first checks if the string `s` contains any '0's. If it does not contain any '0's, it returns the length `n` of the string. Otherwise, it calculates the largest integer `k` such that the count of '0's in `s` is divisible by `k`. If no such `k` exists, it returns 1. The function returns either `n` or the calculated `max_k` based on the conditions described.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of '0's and '1's.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        result = func_1(n, s)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration, `res` is the last element from `results`, and `res` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of cases), an integer `n` (length of a binary string `s`), and a binary string `s` itself. It then processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, s)` to obtain a result for each case, stores these results in a list `results`, and finally prints each result. The function ensures that it correctly handles the input for up to 10,000 test cases, with each binary string having a maximum length of 5,000 characters. If the input format is incorrect or incomplete, the function will still attempt to process as much valid input as possible.
