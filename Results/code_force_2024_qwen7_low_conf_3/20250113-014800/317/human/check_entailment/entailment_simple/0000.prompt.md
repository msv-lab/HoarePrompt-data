You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the binary string s, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    if (zero_count == 0) :
        return n
        #The program returns `n`, which represents the length of the binary string `s`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and `zero_count` is the count of '0's in `s`. The zero_count is not equal to 0
    max_k = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if zero_count % k == 0:
            max_k = k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `zero_count` is the count of '0's in `s`, and `max_k` is the largest integer `k` such that `zero_count % k == 0`, or 1 if no such `k` exists.
    return max_k
    #The program returns `max_k`, which is the largest integer `k` such that `zero_count % k == 0`, or 1 if no such `k` exists

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of '0's and '1's.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        result = func_1(n, s)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration, `res` is the last element from `results`, and `res` is printed.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
