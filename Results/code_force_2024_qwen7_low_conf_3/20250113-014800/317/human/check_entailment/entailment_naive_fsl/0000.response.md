Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the maximum value of \( k \) that allows making all characters in the string equal to '1'. The function `func_1` attempts to find the maximum \( k \) such that the number of '0's in the string is divisible by \( k \). However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that all '0's can be flipped to '1's using the described operations.

For instance, consider the input:
- Length \( n = 5 \)
- String \( s = 00100 \)

The function `func_1` returns \( k = 3 \), but let's analyze why this is incorrect:
- If we choose \( k = 3 \) and flip the substring from the 1st to the 3rd character, we get \( s = 11100 \).
- Next, if we choose \( k = 2 \) and flip the substring from the 3rd to the 5th character, we get \( s = 11111 \).

This sequence of flips works correctly, so \( k = 3 \) is valid. However, the function incorrectly returns the largest divisor of the number of '0's, which is 3 in this case.

Another counterexample is:
- Length \( n = 5 \)
- String \( s = 01000 \)

The function `func_1` returns \( k = 2 \), but let's analyze why this is incorrect:
- If we choose \( k = 2 \) and flip the substring from the 1st to the 2nd character, we get \( s = 11000 \).
- There is no way to flip the remaining '0's to '1's using any \( k \) since flipping any substring will not affect the last '0'.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
