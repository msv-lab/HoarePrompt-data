You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    if zero_count == 0:
        return n
    max_k = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if zero_count % k == 0:
            max_k = k
    return max_k
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`) and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'). It first checks if the string `s` contains any '0's. If it does not contain any '0's, it returns the length `n` of the string. Otherwise, it calculates the largest integer `k` such that the count of '0's in `s` is divisible by `k`. If no such `k` exists, it returns 1. The function returns either `n` or the calculated `max_k` based on the conditions described.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        result = func_1(n, s)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of cases), an integer `n` (length of a binary string `s`), and a binary string `s` itself. It then processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, s)` to obtain a result for each case, stores these results in a list `results`, and finally prints each result. The function ensures that it correctly handles the input for up to 10,000 test cases, with each binary string having a maximum length of 5,000 characters. If the input format is incorrect or incomplete, the function will still attempt to process as much valid input as possible.
