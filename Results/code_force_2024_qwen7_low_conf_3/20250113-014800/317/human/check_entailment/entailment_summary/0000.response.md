Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum value of \( k \) such that we can convert all characters in a binary string to '1' using the operation of flipping \( k \) consecutive characters.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function takes a binary string `s` and its length `n`.
   - It first checks if the string contains any '0's. If not, it directly returns the length `n`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the largest divisor of the count of '0's in the string, which represents the largest possible \( k \). This works because flipping groups of \( k \) characters can effectively clear out all '0's if \( k \) divides the total number of '0's evenly.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to find the maximum \( k \).
   - It processes up to 10,000 test cases, with each string having a maximum length of 5,000 characters.
   - The function correctly handles reading the input and processing each test case independently.

4. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_1` accurately computes the maximum \( k \) for each string.
   - The overall structure of `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution for the given problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
