You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest \( k \) such that we can make all characters in the string '1' by flipping \( k \)-consecutive substrings.

1. **Identify Zeros**: We need to identify the positions of all zeros in the string because these are the only positions that will not be flipped to '1'. The maximum \( k \) will be the distance between two consecutive zeros plus one.

2. **Calculate Maximum \( k \)**: For each zero position, we calculate the distance to the next zero and update the maximum \( k \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no zeros, the entire string is already '1', so the answer is the length of the string.
   - If there is only one zero, the maximum \( k \) is 1.

Let's analyze the given solution:

- **func_1(n, s)**:
  - This function counts the number of zeros in the string.
  - It returns \( n \) if there are no zeros.
  - Otherwise, it tries to find the largest \( k \) such that the number of zeros is divisible by \( k \). This logic is flawed because it doesn't consider the distances between zeros.

- **func_2()**:
  - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Analysis of the Solution:

1. **Counting Zeros**: Counting zeros is correct but not sufficient to find the maximum \( k \).
2. **Finding Maximum \( k \)**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. It only checks divisibility without considering the actual positions of zeros.

### Correct Approach:

We need to find the maximum distance between consecutive zeros and add one to it. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Function to find the maximum k
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_positions = [i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char == '0']
    if not zero_positions:
        return n
    max_k = 1
    for i in range(1, len(zero_positions)):
        max_k = max(max_k, zero_positions[i] - zero_positions[i-1])
    max_k += 1  # Add one to include the last segment
    return max_k

# Function to read input and process test cases
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        result = func_1(n, s)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Example usage
func_2()
```

### Conclusion:

The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly find the maximum \( k \). The corrected approach should be used to ensure the program works as intended.
