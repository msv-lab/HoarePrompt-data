The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`) and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'). It first checks if the string `s` contains any '0's. If it does not contain any '0's, it returns the length `n` of the string. Otherwise, it calculates the largest integer `k` such that the count of '0's in `s` is divisible by `k`. If no such `k` exists, it returns 1. The function returns either `n` or the calculated `max_k` based on the conditions described.
