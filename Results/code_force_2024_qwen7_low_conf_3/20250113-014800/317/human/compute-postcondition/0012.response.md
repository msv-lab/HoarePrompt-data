The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n` after converting it to an integer. The value of `index` is increased by 2. The other variables are not affected.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The initial state is:
   - `data` is a list of strings with at least one element.
   - `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]` minus 1.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
   - `s` is the string at index `index + 3` in `data`.
   - `index` is increased by 2.
   - `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it twice.

2. After executing `n = int(data[index])`:
   - `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `index` has been increased by 2.

The output state is:
- `data` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]` minus 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data` (since `index` was increased by 2).
- `index` is increased by 2.
- `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it twice.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]` minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`, `index` is increased by 2, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it twice**.
