`t` is assigned the value of `data[0]`, which is an integer obtained from the input split by whitespace. The value of `t` is now explicitly converted to an integer. The states of the other variables (`data`, `n`, and `s`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input based on whitespace, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of '0's and '1's.**
