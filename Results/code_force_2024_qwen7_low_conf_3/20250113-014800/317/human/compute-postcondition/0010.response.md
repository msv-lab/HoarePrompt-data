The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Here, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, where `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]` and `s` is the string at index `index + 3` in `data`. Additionally, the variable `index` is increased by 2. 

Let's summarize the changes:
- `index` is increased by 2.
- `results` gets the value of `result` appended to it.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings containing at least one element.
- `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
- `s` is the string at index `index + 3` in `data`.
- `index` is increased by 2.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.

The output state will be:
- `index` is increased by 2.
- `results` now includes the value of `result`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings that contains at least one element, `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 3` in `data`, `index` is increased by 2, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it.**
