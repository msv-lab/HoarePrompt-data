The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition (`def func_2()`), but based on the constraints and relationships provided, it appears to process multiple test cases internally. Each test case consists of an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), and a binary string `s` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.

The output depends on the specific implementation within the function, but since the exact logic is not provided, we can only describe the input parameters:

- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each `t`, `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- For each `n`, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases internally, where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and a binary string `s` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.**
