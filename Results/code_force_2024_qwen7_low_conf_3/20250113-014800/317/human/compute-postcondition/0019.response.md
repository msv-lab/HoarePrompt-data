The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `s`. Based on the initial state, `s` was previously `data[index + 1]`, and now it is reassigned to the same value. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `t` is `data[0] - 4`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`, `index` is `index + 4`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`**
