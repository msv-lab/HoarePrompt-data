According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `results`.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `t` is 0.
- `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration.

For the loop to execute, the `results` list must have at least one element. The values of `t` and `index` do not affect the loop's execution condition directly since they are not used in the loop itself.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` must contain at least one element**
