According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop will execute if `results` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` must contain at least one element, and `res` has not been assigned a value.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element, and `res` must be assigned a value from `results`.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` must contain at least one element, `res` must be the first element from `results`**
