The code `print(res)` prints the value of `res`. However, the variable `res` is not defined or modified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the information that `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, and `results` must contain at least one element.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` must contain at least one element**
