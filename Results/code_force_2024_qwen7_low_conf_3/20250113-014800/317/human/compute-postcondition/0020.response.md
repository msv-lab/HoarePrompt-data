The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Based on the initial state, we know:

- `data` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `t` is `data[0] - 4`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`.
- `index` is `index + 4`.
- `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.
- `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`.

After executing `index += 2`, the value of `index` is updated by adding 2 to its current value. Therefore, the updated value of `index` is `(index + 4) + 2`. 

Since the exact initial value of `index` is not specified, let's denote the initial value of `index` as `i`. Then the updated value of `index` is `i + 4 + 2 = i + 6`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `t` is `data[0] - 4`, `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 6]`, `s` is the string at index `i + 7` in `data`, `index` is `i + 6`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, `s` is the string at index `i + 7` in `data`.**
