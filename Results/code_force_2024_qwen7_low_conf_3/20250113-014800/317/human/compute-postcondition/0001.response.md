`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input based on whitespace, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of '0's and '1's.**
