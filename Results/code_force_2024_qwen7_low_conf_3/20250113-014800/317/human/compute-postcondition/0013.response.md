Output State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]` minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 2` in `data`, `index` is increased by 2, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it twice, `s` is updated to the string at index `index + 1` in `data`**.

Explanation: The line `s = data[index + 1]` updates the value of `s` to be the string at the new index `index + 1`. Since `index` was increased by 2 previously, the new index is now `index + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as no operation affects them directly.
