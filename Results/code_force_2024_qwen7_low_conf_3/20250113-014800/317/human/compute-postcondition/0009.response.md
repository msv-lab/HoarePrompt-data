The code `result = func_1(n, s)` assigns the return value of `func_1(n, s)` to the variable `result`. Here, `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, and `s` is the string at index `index + 3` in `data`. The function `func_1` is called with these arguments, but since its implementation is not provided, we only know that `result` is the return value of this function call.

Additionally, the variable `index` is increased by 2.

So, the updated states are:
- `data` is unchanged.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `s` is unchanged.
- `index` is now `index + 2`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings that contains at least one element, `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 3` in `data`, `index` is increased by 2, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`**.
