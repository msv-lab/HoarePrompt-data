The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing values of the variables `t`, `data`, `n`, `s`, or `index`. Therefore, the only update is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input based on whitespace, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**.
