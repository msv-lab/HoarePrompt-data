The code `result = func_1(n, s)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(n, s)` to the variable `result`. The value of `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 6]`, and `s` is the string at index `i + 7` in `data`. The function `func_1(n, s)` returns a value which is stored in `result`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `t` is `data[0] - 4`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 6]`
- `s` is the string at index `i + 7` in `data`
- `index` is `i + 6`
- `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times
- `result` was previously the return value of `func_1(n, s)`
- `s` remains the same after the assignment

After executing the code, the value of `result` is updated to the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, and `results` now contains the return value of `func_1(n, s)` four times (the original three plus the new one).

Output State: **`t` is `data[0] - 4`, `n` is the integer value of `data[i + 6]`, `s` is the string at index `i + 7` in `data`, `index` is `i + 6`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it four times, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, `s` is the string at index `i + 7` in `data`**
