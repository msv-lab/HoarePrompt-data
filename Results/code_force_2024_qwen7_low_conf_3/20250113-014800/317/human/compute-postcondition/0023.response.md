Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input based on whitespace.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
- `index` is 1.
- `results` is an empty list.

### Loop Code
```python
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    s = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    result = func_1(n, s)
    results.append(result)
```

### Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, `t` is set to `data[0]`.
   - `index` starts at 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `s` is set to the string at `data[index + 1]`.
   - `index` is incremented by 2.
   - `result` is computed using `func_1(n, s)`.
   - `result` is appended to `results`.

3. **After k Iterations**:
   - After the first iteration, `t` becomes `data[0] - 1`, `index` becomes 3, and `results` contains one element.
   - After the second iteration, `t` becomes `data[0] - 2`, `index` becomes 5, and `results` contains two elements.
   - This pattern continues until the loop terminates.

4. **Final State**:
   - The loop will terminate when `t` becomes 0.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute `data[0]` times.
   - After `data[0]` iterations, `t` will be 0.
   - `index` will be `2 * data[0] + 1`.
   - `results` will contain `data[0]` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, s)`.

### Final Output State
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `t` is 0.
- `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration.

### Output State
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration.**
