`index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was `index + 2`, so the new value of `index` is now `index + 4`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]` minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 2` in `data`, `index` is increased by 4, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it twice, `s` is updated to the string at index `index + 1` in `data`**
