Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `data` is a list of strings with at least one element.
   - `t` is `data[0] - 4`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`.
   - `index` is `index + 4`.
   - `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   n = int(data[index])
   ```

3. The impact of this code is:
   - It assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`. This means that `n` now holds the integer value of whatever was at the position `index` in the `data` list.
   - The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `data` remains a list of strings with at least one element.
- `t` remains `data[0] - 4`.
- `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `s` remains the string at index `index + 1` in `data`.
- `index` remains `index + 4`.
- `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times.
- `result` remains the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `t` is `data[0] - 4`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`, `index` is `index + 4`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`**
