According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `data` is a list of strings
- `t` is 0
- `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`
- `results` must contain at least one element

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The variable `results` must still contain at least one element.

Since no modifications are needed for `data`, `t`, or `index` to satisfy the condition for the loop to continue, we only need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * data[0] + 1`, `results` must contain at least one element**
