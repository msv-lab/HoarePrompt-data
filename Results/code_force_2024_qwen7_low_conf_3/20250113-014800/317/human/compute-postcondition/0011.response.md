According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know:

- `data` is a list of strings that contains at least one element.
- `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
- `s` is the string at index `index + 3` in `data`.
- `index` is increased by 2.
- `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

1. `data` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
2. `t` is decreased by 1.
3. `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
4. `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
5. `index` is increased by 2 (this is already taken into account in the decrement of `t`).
6. `results` will now have the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it once more.

State: **`data` is a list of strings that contains at least one element, `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]` minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 3` in `data`, `index` is increased by 2, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it twice**
