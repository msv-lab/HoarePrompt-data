The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `index`. The initial values of `t`, `data`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the updated value of `index`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input based on whitespace, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `index` is 1.**
