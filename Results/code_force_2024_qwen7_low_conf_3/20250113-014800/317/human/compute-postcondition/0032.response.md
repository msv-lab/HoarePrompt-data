Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of cases), an integer `n` (length of a binary string `s`), and a binary string `s` itself. It then processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, s)` to obtain a result for each case, stores these results in a list `results`, and finally prints each result. The function ensures that it correctly handles the input for up to 10,000 test cases, with each binary string having a maximum length of 5,000 characters. If the input format is incorrect or incomplete, the function will still attempt to process as much valid input as possible.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input format is incorrect (e.g., non-integer values or invalid binary strings), the function will treat the invalid parts as the end of the current test case and move on to the next one.
- If the number of test cases `t` exceeds 10,000, the function will only process up to the first 10,000 cases.
- If any binary string `s` has a length greater than 5,000, the function will only consider the first 5,000 characters of the string for processing.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not provide any error handling for situations where the input data might be missing or improperly formatted beyond treating them as the end of a test case.
