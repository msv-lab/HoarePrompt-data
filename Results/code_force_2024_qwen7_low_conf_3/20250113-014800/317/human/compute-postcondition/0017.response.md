Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `data` is a list of strings with at least one element.
   - `t` is `data[0] - 1`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`.
   - `index` is `index + 4`.
   - `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.
   - Since `t` is initially `data[0] - 1`, and we append the result to `results` three times, `t` decreases by 3 each time the loop runs.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `t` starts as `data[0] - 1`.
   - After each iteration, `t` decreases by 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after the decrement.

5. **Calculating the New Value of `t`:**
   - Let's assume the loop ran for \( k \) iterations so far.
   - Initially, `t = data[0] - 1`.
   - After \( k \) iterations, `t = (data[0] - 1) - 3k`.

6. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `(data[0] - 1) - 3(k + 1) > 0`.

7. **Updating the States:**
   - `t` will be reduced by 3.
   - `index` is updated to `index + 4` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The other states (`data`, `n`, `s`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop.

8. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` will be `(data[0] - 1) - 3k - 3`.
   - `index` will be `index + 4`.

Given this, if we assume `k` iterations have already occurred, then:

- `t` becomes `(data[0] - 1) - 3(k + 1)`.
- `index` becomes `index + 4`.

Since we need to adjust for the next iteration, let's assume `k = 0` for simplicity (first iteration):

- `t` becomes `(data[0] - 1) - 3 * 1 = data[0] - 4`.
- `index` becomes `index + 4`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `t` is `data[0] - 4`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the string at index `index + 1` in `data`, `index` is `index + 4`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n, s)` appended to it three times, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`**.
