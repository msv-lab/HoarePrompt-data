The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of cases), an integer `n` (length of a binary string `s`), and a binary string `s` itself. It then processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, s)` to obtain a result for each case, stores these results in a list `results`, and finally prints each result. The function ensures that it correctly handles the input for up to 10,000 test cases, with each binary string having a maximum length of 5,000 characters. If the input format is incorrect or incomplete, the function will still attempt to process as much valid input as possible.
