Precondition: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.** 

Note: `func_1(a, b)` is a helper function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. However, its implementation is not provided in the given program. The precondition does not include details about `func_1` since it is assumed to be correctly implemented elsewhere in the solution.
