Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
   - `count` is 2
   - `a` is 3
   - `b` is \(m + 1\)
   - The condition \((a + b) \% (b \cdot func_1(a, b))\) must equal 0 for the loop to continue.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for b in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is still 0
   - `m` remains the same as it is an upper bound and does not change within the loop
   - `count` is 2
   - `a` is still 3
   - `b` was \(m + 1\) at the start of the previous iteration

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if the current value of `b` is less than `m + 1`.
   - Since `b` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `b` would be \(m + 1 - 1 = m\).

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than `m + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `m`.
   - The condition \((a + b) \% (b \cdot func_1(a, b))\) must still hold true for the loop to continue.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `b` changes to \(m\)
- All other states remain the same.

**Final State:**
State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is 2, `a` is 3, `b` is \(m\)**.
