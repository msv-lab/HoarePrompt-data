Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `m` must be at least 1.
   - The loop checks if `(a + b)` is divisible by `(b * func_1(a, b))`.
   - If it is divisible, `count` is increased by 1.
   - `m` does not change within the loop.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration:**
   - The loop runs over the range from 1 to `m` (inclusive).
   - For the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Therefore, the new value of `b` will be `current_b + 1`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Since `m` does not change, the only thing that changes is `b`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - `m` remains unchanged and still must be at least 1.
   - `b` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - We need to ensure that the new value of `b` is still within the range `[1, m]`.

Given this reasoning, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time:

- `m` must be at least 1.
- `b` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `b` must still be less than or equal to `m`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `m` must be at least 1, `b` must be less than or equal to `m`, and `b` is incremented by 1 from its current value.**
