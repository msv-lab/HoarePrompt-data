Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of \((n + b) // b^2\) for all integers `b` in the range from 1 to `m`, then subtracts 1 from the result. This value is stored in a list `outs`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `outs`. The function accepts no explicit parameters and reads `t`, `n`, and `m` from standard input. The final state of the program is that all calculated values have been printed to standard output. Edge cases include the minimum and maximum possible values for `t`, `n`, and `m` as specified, and the possibility of inputs that might cause division by zero, though the code checks for this by ensuring `b` starts from 1, avoiding such cases.**
