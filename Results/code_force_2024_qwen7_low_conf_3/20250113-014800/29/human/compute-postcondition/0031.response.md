`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is either 1 or remains the same as the precondition, so after incrementing, `count` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is 2, `a` is 3, `b` is \(m + 1\).

Output State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is 2, `a` is 3, `b` is \(m + 1\)**
