Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `m` is the integer greater than or equal to 1 input by the user in the last iteration, `tot` is the sum of \((n + b) // b^2\) for all \(b\) in the range from 1 to `m`, `outs` is a list containing `t - 1` instances of `-1` followed by `tot - 1`, `out` is printed as `outs` until the loop finishes, at which point all elements in `outs` have been printed.**
