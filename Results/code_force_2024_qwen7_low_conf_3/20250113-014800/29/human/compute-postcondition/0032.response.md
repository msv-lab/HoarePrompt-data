Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is 2, `a` is 3, `b` is \(m + 1\). If \((a + b) \% (b \cdot func_1(a, b))\) equals 0, then these conditions hold. Otherwise, the conditions from the else part do not apply since there is no else part specified.***
