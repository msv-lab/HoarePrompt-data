According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `m` must be at least 1.
- `b` must be less than or equal to `m`.
- `count` is incremented by 1 if `(a + b)` is divisible by `(b * func_1(a, b))`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `m`.
- At the end of the last iteration, `b` was less than or equal to `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `m`.

Let's denote the value of `b` at the end of the last iteration as `b_end`. Since `b_end` was less than or equal to `m`, the next value of `b` will be `b_end + 1`.

The updated state will be:
- `m` must still be at least 1.
- `b` must now be `b_end + 1` and must be less than or equal to `m`.
- `count` will either remain unchanged or be incremented based on the condition in the loop body.

Since we don't know the exact value of `b_end` from the given information, let's represent it symbolically as `b_end`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
- `m` must be at least 1.
- `b` must be `b_end + 1` and must be less than or equal to `m`.
- `count` will either remain unchanged or be incremented based on the condition in the loop body.

State: **`m` must be at least 1, `b` must be `b_end + 1` and must be less than or equal to `m`, and `count` will either remain unchanged or be incremented based on the condition in the loop body.**
