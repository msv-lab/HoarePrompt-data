`count` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `count` is not specified in the initial state. The conditions for `m` and `(a + b)` being divisible by `(b * func_1(a, b))` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be at least 1; `(a + b)` is divisible by `(b * func_1(a, b))`; `count` is increased by 1.
