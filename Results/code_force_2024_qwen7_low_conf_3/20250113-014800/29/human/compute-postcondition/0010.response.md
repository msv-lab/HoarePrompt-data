`count` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and constraints on `m`, `b`, and `count` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be at least 1, `b` must be `b_end + 1` and must be less than or equal to `m`, and `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`m` must be at least 1, `b` must be `b_end + 1` and must be less than or equal to `m`, and `count` is incremented by 1**
