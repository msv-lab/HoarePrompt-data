Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is either 1 or remains the same as the precondition, `a` is 3, `b` is 1. If \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\), then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
