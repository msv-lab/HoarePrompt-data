Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
   - `count` is either 0 or 1
   - `a` is 2
   - `b` is 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `b = 1` to `b = m`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   The loop body is omitted, but we know it checks if \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func_1}(a, b)) = 0\) and sets `count` to 1 if true, otherwise keeps `count` as 0.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is still 0
   - `m` remains the same
   - `count` is either 0 or 1
   - `a` is still 2
   - `b` is now the value it reached at the end of the previous iteration

5. **Determining the Next `b` Value:**
   Since the loop increments `b` by 1 each iteration, if `b` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Checking Loop Execution Condition:**
   The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than `m`.

7. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `total` remains 0
   - `m` remains the same
   - `count` remains either 0 or 1
   - `a` remains 2
   - `b` is now 2

8. **Final State:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be less than `m`.

**State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is either 0 or 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 2**
