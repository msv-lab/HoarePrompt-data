Output State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is the total number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`, `a` is 2, `b` is `m + 1`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `m`.
- For each iteration, it checks if \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\).
- If the condition is true, `count` is incremented by 1.
- If the condition is false, `count` remains unchanged.
- After all iterations, `count` will be the total number of times the condition was true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`.

Since the loop will execute exactly `m` times, `count` will reflect the total occurrences of the condition being true across all `b` values from 1 to `m`.
