Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `count` is either 1 or 2.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `m`.

3. **Condition Inside the Loop:**
   - If \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b))\) is equal to 0, then `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged as 1 or 2.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is still 0.
   - `m` remains the same as it was initialized.
   - `count` is either 1 or 2.
   - `a` is still 2.
   - `b` is 2.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to increment by 1.
   - Therefore, `b` becomes 3.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `count` remains either 1 or 2.
   - `a` remains 2.
   - `b` is now 3.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is either 1 or 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 3**
