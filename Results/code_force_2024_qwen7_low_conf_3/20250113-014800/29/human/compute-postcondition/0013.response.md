According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `count` is the number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`
- `a` is 1
- `b` is `m + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `a` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `a` will be `2`.

Since `a` is the only variable being modified by the loop, and it is the starting point of the range in the for loop, no other state needs to be adjusted. The value of `m` and `count` remain the same.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is the number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`, `a` is 2, and `b` is `m + 1`**.
