The code initializes a variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m`. The output state should reflect this initialization while keeping the preconditions for `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `count` is 0**
