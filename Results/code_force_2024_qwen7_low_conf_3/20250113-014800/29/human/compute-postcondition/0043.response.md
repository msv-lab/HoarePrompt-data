The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will process a series of test cases internally, where for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and the sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` over all test cases do not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\). The function returns a value based on the processing of these test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes test cases where `n` and `m` are positive integers within specified ranges and returns a value based on the test cases.**
