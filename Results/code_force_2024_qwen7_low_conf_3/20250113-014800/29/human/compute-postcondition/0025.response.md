Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop is defined as `for a in range(1, n + 1):`. This means `a` will take values from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - We need to determine the new value of `a` at the start of the next iteration.
   - We also need to consider if the loop can continue based on the current value of `a`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `count` is the total number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` is `m + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `a`:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `a` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`, and currently `a` is 2, the next value of `a` would be 3 if the loop can continue.

4. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `a` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`. Since `a` is currently 2, and assuming `n` is at least 2 (since it's a positive integer), the loop can continue with `a` being 3.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `total` remains 0 because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `total`.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `count` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `count`.
   - `a` changes to 3.
   - `b` is not directly controlled by the loop, but since `a` changes to 3, `b` will start checking from 1 to `m` again.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is the total number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`, `a` is 3, `b` is 1**
