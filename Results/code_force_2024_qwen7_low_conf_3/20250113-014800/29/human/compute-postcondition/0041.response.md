The code `print(out)` simply prints the value of the variable `out`. Since the value of `out` was previously set to `-1`, it will print `-1`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `m` is the integer greater than or equal to 1 input by the user in the last iteration, `tot` is the sum of \((n + b) // b^2\) for all \(b\) in the range from 1 to `m`, `outs` is a list containing `t - 1` instances of `-1` followed by `tot - 1`, `out` is `-1` and the value `-1` is printed.**
