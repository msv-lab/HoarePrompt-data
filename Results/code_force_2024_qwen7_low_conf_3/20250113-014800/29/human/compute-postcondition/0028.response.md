`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^6\), `a` is 3, `b` is 1, and the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true. Since `count` is incremented by 1, it now equals 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is 1, `a` is 3, `b` is 1, and \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0**
