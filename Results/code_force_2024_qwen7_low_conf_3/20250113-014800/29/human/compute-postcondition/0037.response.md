Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is the total number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m` and any `a` in the range 1 to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The outer loop iterates over `a` from 1 to `n`.
- For each value of `a`, the inner loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `m`.
- The condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is checked for each combination of `a` and `b`.
- If the condition is satisfied, `count` is incremented.
- After all iterations of both loops are complete, `count` will hold the total number of times the condition was met for any combination of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges.

Since the loop executes for all combinations of `a` and `b` within their specified ranges, the final value of `count` will reflect the total number of valid combinations. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
