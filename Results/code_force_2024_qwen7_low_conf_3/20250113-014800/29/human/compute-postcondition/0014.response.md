Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `count` is the number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` is `m + 1`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```
   for b in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop runs from `b = 1` to `b = m`.
   - Each iteration updates the `count` based on the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\).

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The variable `b` starts at `m + 1` but the loop requires `b` to start at 1 and increment up to `m`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `b` to start at 1 instead of `m + 1`.
   - Additionally, since `b` should iterate through all values from 1 to `m`, we need to ensure that the initial value of `b` is set to 1.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `m` remains as it is because it is already defined within the valid range.
   - `count` remains unchanged as the loop has not yet executed.
   - `a` is fixed at 2.
   - `b` needs to be adjusted to start at 1.

So, the required state after adjustment is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is 0, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
