Output State: **`total` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is the total number of times \((3 + b) \% (b \cdot func_1(3, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`, `a` is 3, `b` is `m + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`total`**: The initial state of `total` is 0, and the code does not modify `total` inside the loop. Therefore, `total` remains 0 after all iterations.
- **`m`**: The value of `m` remains unchanged as the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m`.
- **`count`**: The loop increments `count` each time the condition \((3 + b) \% (b \cdot func_1(3, b)) == 0\) is satisfied for any `b` in the range 1 to `m`. After the loop completes, `count` contains the total number of times this condition was true.
- **`a`**: The value of `a` remains 3 throughout the loop.
- **`b`**: After the loop finishes, `b` takes the value `m + 1`, which is the upper bound of the range plus one.

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `m`, `b` will eventually reach `m + 1`, marking the end of the loop. At this point, `count` will reflect the total number of times the specified condition was met during the loop's execution.
