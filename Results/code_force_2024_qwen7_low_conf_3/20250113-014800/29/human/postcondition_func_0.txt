The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD iteratively until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. After the function completes, `a` is the GCD of the initial `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This process handles all edge cases, including when one of the inputs is 1 or when `a` and `b` are equal. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
