#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are the input parameters to the main problem.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD iteratively until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. After the function completes, `a` is the GCD of the initial `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This process handles all edge cases, including when one of the inputs is 1 or when `a` and `b` are equal. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.

                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is the total number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m` and any `a` in the range 1 to `n`.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of times (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 is true for any b in the range 1 to m and any a in the range 1 to n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). It iterates over all pairs of integers `(a, b)` where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds true. If the condition is met, it increments the counter `count`. After evaluating all possible pairs, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of times the given condition was satisfied. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly within its body, but the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) could potentially fail due to the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`. However, the function itself does not provide any additional logic to handle invalid values returned by `func_1(a, b)`.
