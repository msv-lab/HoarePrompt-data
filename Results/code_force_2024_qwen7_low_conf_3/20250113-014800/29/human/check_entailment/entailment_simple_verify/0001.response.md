### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.
   - The logic is correct and efficient.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - For each pair, it checks whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the `func_1` function.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the `count`.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step with the help of the annotations:

- **Initial State**: `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- **Loop Initialization**: `a` ranges from `1` to `n`, and for each value of `a`, `b` ranges from `1` to `m`.
- **Condition Check**: For each pair `(a, b)`, the program calculates `gcd(a, b)` using `func_1(a, b)`. Then it checks if `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
- **Count Increment**: If the condition is met, `count` is incremented.

The program systematically evaluates each pair `(a, b)` within the given ranges and correctly counts the pairs that satisfy the condition. The nested loops ensure that all pairs are considered, and the GCD calculation is done efficiently using the Euclidean algorithm.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct implementation of the logic, the original assessment is accurate.
