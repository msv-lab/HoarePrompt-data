You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    4
    14

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are the input parameters to the main problem.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `count` is the total number of times \((a + b) \% (b \times func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true for any `b` in the range 1 to `m` and any `a` in the range 1 to `n`.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of times (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 is true for any b in the range 1 to m and any a in the range 1 to n




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The logic is correct and implements the standard Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - For each pair, it checks whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the `func_1` function.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the `count`.

Given the problem statement and the functions provided, the program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

### Correctness:

- **Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD and checks the given condition for each pair `(a, b)`. The nested loops ensure that all pairs within the specified ranges are considered, and the condition is checked for each pair.
