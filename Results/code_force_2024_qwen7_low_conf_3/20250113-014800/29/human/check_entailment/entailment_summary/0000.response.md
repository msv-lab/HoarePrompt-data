Reasoning:
1. The first function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. This is a crucial component since the problem statement involves the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. The second function `func_2` iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. For each pair, it calculates the GCD using `func_1(a, b)` and checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) is satisfied. If the condition is met, it increments the counter `count`. This function directly addresses the core requirement of counting the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

3. The problem description and the execution summaries of both functions indicate that these functions work together to correctly solve the problem. Function `func_1` ensures that the GCD is calculated correctly, and function `func_2` correctly counts the number of valid pairs based on the condition provided in the problem.

4. The execution summary for `func_2` mentions potential issues with the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`, but since the Euclidean algorithm implemented in `func_1` is correct, this should not lead to incorrect results for valid input ranges (i.e., \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)). The problem also specifies that the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^6\), which is a constraint that helps in ensuring that the solution works within reasonable time limits.

Given the above reasoning, the implementation of the two functions together meets the requirements of the problem statement.
