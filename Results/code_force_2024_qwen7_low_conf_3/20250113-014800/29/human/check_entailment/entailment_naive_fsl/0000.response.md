Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and then checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The nested loops iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` within the specified ranges and count the number of valid pairs. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the implementation appears to cover all necessary cases without missing any edge scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
