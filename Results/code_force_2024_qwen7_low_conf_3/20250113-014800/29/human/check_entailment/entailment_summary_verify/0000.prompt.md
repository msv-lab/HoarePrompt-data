You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). It iterates over all pairs of integers `(a, b)` where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds true. If the condition is met, it increments the counter `count`. After evaluating all possible pairs, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of times the given condition was satisfied. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly within its body, but the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) could potentially fail due to the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`. However, the function itself does not provide any additional logic to handle invalid values returned by `func_1(a, b)`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and then checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The nested loops iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` within the specified ranges and count the number of valid pairs. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the implementation appears to cover all necessary cases without missing any edge scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
