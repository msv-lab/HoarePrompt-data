### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The logic is sound and should always produce the correct result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. For each pair, it computes the GCD using `func_1(a, b)` and checks if `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
   - The condition being checked is \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\), which is equivalent to checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \times \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function counts the number of pairs that satisfy this condition and returns the count.

### Analysis and Evaluation:

- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD and iterates over all possible pairs to check the given condition.
- The original assessment also correctly notes that the program should handle all pairs within the specified ranges and should not have any edge cases explicitly handled, which is a reasonable assumption since the problem constraints are well-defined.

Given the problem description and the functions provided, the program correctly implements the solution. The logic in `func_2` ensures that all pairs `(a, b)` within the specified ranges are considered, and the condition is checked for each pair. There are no logical errors or issues with the implementation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
