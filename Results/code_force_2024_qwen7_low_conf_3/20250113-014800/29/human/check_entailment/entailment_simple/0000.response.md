Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the implementation and verify that it meets the specified requirements:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It correctly returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.
   - The function is used within the second function to compute the GCD needed for the condition check.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function iterates through all possible ordered pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
   - For each pair, it checks whether the condition `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied, where `gcd(a, b)` is calculated using `func_1`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the counter `count`.
   - After checking all pairs, it returns the final count.

### Verification:
- **Problem Description**: The task is to find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
  - `1 ≤ a ≤ n`
  - `1 ≤ b ≤ m`
  - `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

- **Implementation**:
  - The `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b`.
  - The `func_2` iterates over all valid pairs `(a, b)` and uses the GCD computed by `func_1` to check the condition `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
  - If the condition is met, it increments the count, and at the end, it returns the total count.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
