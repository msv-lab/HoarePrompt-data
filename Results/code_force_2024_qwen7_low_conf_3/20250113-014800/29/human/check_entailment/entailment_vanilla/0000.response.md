### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The logic is correct and implements the standard Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - For each pair, it checks whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the `func_1` function.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the `count`.

Given the problem statement and the functions provided, the program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

### Correctness:

- **Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD and checks the given condition for each pair `(a, b)`. The nested loops ensure that all pairs within the specified ranges are considered, and the condition is checked for each pair.
