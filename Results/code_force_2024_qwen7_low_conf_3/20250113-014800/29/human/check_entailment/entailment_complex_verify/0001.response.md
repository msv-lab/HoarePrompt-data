### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The logic is sound and handles all edge cases, such as when one of the inputs is 1 or when `a` and `b` are equal.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - For each pair, it calls `func_1(a, b)` to get the GCD and then checks whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's analyze the overall correctness of the program:

- The program correctly uses the GCD to simplify the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The nested loops iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges, ensuring that no valid pairs are missed.
- The condition `a + b` % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 is checked accurately for each pair.

However, there is one critical aspect to consider:

- The problem description states that `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. The program correctly handles these constraints.
- The program also ensures that `n` and `m` are within the specified limits, i.e., \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).

Given that the program correctly implements the required logic and handles all necessary checks, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:

- The program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
- The nested loops ensure that all possible pairs are considered.
- The use of the Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD is appropriate and correctly implemented.

### Final Evaluation:
