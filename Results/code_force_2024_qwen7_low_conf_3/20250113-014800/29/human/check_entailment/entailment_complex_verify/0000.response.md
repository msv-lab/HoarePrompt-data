Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the program step by step using the provided annotated code and the original assessment.

### Function 1: `func_1`
- **Function Purpose**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Annotations**: Correctly describes the function's behavior and the post-loop state.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles all edge cases appropriately, including when one of the inputs is 1 or when `a` and `b` are equal.

### Function 2: `func_2`
- **Function Purpose**: Counts the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \times \gcd(a, b)\).
- **Annotations**: Correctly describes the function's behavior and the post-loop state.
- **Nested Loops**: Iterates through all possible values of `a` and `b` within the specified ranges.
- **Condition Check**: The condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is checked for each pair \((a, b)\).

### Overall Program Analysis
- **Correctness of GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Condition Evaluation**: The `func_2` function correctly evaluates the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) for each pair \((a, b)\).
- **Loop Execution**: The nested loops ensure that all possible pairs \((a, b)\) are considered within the given ranges.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement, including when \(n\) or \(m\) is large.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description and handles all necessary cases without missing any edge scenarios.

Final: **True**
