Reasoning:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This function ensures that after the computation, `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This meets the requirement to calculate the GCD, which is essential for the main function.
- `func_2` iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the specified ranges and checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds true. This function correctly counts the number of valid pairs according to the given problem statement. The function does not have any logical errors or missing functionalities.

Given that both functions correctly implement their intended functionalities and there are no logical flaws or missing parts, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
