The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). It iterates over all pairs of integers `(a, b)` where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds true. If the condition is met, it increments the counter `count`. After evaluating all possible pairs, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of times the given condition was satisfied. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly within its body, but the condition \((a + b) \% (b \times \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) could potentially fail due to the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`. However, the function itself does not provide any additional logic to handle invalid values returned by `func_1(a, b)`.
