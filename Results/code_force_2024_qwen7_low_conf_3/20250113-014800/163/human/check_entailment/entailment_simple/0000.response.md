Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`. It also reads the intervals `[l_i, r_i]` for each of the `m` cats.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, with `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5`.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - `aseg`: This array keeps track of the cumulative increments and decrements needed to manage the active intervals. It is initialized with zeros and adjusted as new intervals are processed.
   - `along`: This array keeps track of the farthest endpoint for each starting point, ensuring no overlap in the chosen intervals.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**:
   - `dp`: This array stores the maximum number of cats that can be fed up to each step. It is filled using a reverse iteration to ensure that the solution respects the non-overlapping constraint.
   - For each step `i`, the DP value is updated based on whether feeding the current interval is feasible without overlapping with previous intervals.

4. **Logic Execution**:
   - The program processes the intervals and updates the `aseg` and `along` arrays correctly.
   - It then uses these arrays to fill the `dp` array, which ultimately gives the maximum number of cats that can be fed.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

5. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program handles the boundaries correctly by initializing and updating the arrays properly.
   - It ensures that no interval overlaps with previously selected ones by maintaining the `along` array.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals (or in this context, the maximum number of cats that can be fed without overeating), it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
