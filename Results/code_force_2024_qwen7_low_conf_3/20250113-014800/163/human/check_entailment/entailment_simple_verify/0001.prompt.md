You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a fun game where you need to feed cats that come and go. The level of
the game consists of n steps. There are m cats; the cat i is present in steps
from l_i to r_i , inclusive. In each step, you can feed all the cats that are
currently present or do nothing.

If you feed the same cat more than once, it will overeat, and you will
immediately lose the game. Your goal is to feed as many cats as possible
without causing any cat to overeat.

Find the maximum number of cats you can feed.

Formally, you need to select several integer points from the segment from 1 to
n in such a way that among given segments, none covers two or more of the
selected points, and as many segments as possible cover one of the selected
points.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le
10^6 , 1 \le m\le 2\cdot 10^5 ).

The i -th of the next m lines contains a pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 \le
l_i \le r_i \le n ).

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^6 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the maximum number of cats you can
feed.

Note

In the first example, one of the ways to feed five cats is to feed at steps 4
and 11 .

  * At step 4 , cats 1 , 2 , and 3 will be fed.
  * At step 11 , cats 5 and 6 will be fed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided solution uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `aseg` is an array to store the prefix sum of the segments' lengths.
   - `along` is an array to keep track of the latest position to which the current segment extends without overlap.

2. **Building the Prefix Sum and Extent Array**:
   - For each segment, update `aseg` and `along`. `aseg[l]` is incremented by 1 to indicate the start of the segment, and `aseg[r + 1]` is decremented to end the segment. 
   - `along[l]` is updated to ensure it keeps track of the farthest extent without overlap.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - `dp` is used to store the maximum number of cats that can be fed up to each point.
   - Iterate through the segments from the end to the beginning, updating `aseg` with the prefix sum and using `along` to determine the latest non-overlapping position.
   - For each position `i`, decide whether to include the current segment or skip it, ensuring no overlap.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result is stored in `dp[1]`, representing the maximum number of cats that can be fed starting from the first step.

This approach ensures that no cat is fed more than once, adhering to the problem constraints. The dynamic programming part correctly calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping segments (cats).

Given the structure and the logic of the code, it seems to correctly implement the required functionality.
