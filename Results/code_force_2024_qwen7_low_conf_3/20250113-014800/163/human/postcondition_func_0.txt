The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \(n\) and \(m\) such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It then reads \(m\) pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\). The function constructs a list `aseg` which keeps track of cumulative increments and decrements up to each index, and a list `along` which records the maximum right boundary encountered up to each index. It then calculates a dynamic programming array `dp` to find the maximum value based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the value stored in `dp[1]`. This process is repeated for each test case.
