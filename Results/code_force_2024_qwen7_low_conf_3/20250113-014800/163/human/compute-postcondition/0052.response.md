The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers separated by a space from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r` respectively. This means that `l` and `r` are now integers, but their specific values are not known from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aseg` is [0, 0, ..., 0], `along` is [-1, -1, ..., -1], `dp` is a list of length `n + 2`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
