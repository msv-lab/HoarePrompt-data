The code snippet `aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]` increments the value of `aseg[i + 1]` by the value of `aseg[i]`. However, since the initial values of `aseg` and the index `i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the updated elements. We can only state that the value of `aseg[i + 1]` has been updated.

Output State: **`aseg[i + 1]'s` value is now the original value of `aseg[i]` plus the original value of `aseg[i + 1]`; the value of `aseg[i]'` remains unchanged.**
