`aseg[l]` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is an input integer, so the exact value of `aseg[l]` depends on the value of `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aseg` is [0, 0, ..., 0] with the element at index `l` incremented by 1, `along` is [-1, -1, ..., -1], `dp` is a list of length `n + 2`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
