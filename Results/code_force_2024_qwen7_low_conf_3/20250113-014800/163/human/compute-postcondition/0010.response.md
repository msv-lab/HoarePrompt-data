The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r` respectively. The previous values of `l` and `r` are replaced by the new values read from input. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer read from input, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `aseg[l]` is 1, `aseg[r + 1]` is -1, all other elements of `aseg` are 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements set to -1 except `along[l]` which is now `r + 1`, `l` is an integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, `l` is updated to a value read from input, `r` is updated to a value read from input**.
