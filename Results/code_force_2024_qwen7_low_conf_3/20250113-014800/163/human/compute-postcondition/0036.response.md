Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `aseg[1]` to `aseg[n]`, `along[i]` is the maximum value of `along` for all indices up to `i`. All other elements of `aseg` are 0. `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `along[k]` (for \(1 \leq k \leq n + 1\)) is the maximum value of `r + 1` among all intervals processed for that `k`. `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[n]` set to `aseg[n]` and `dp` for all other indices is 0. If `along[i]` is less than 0, `dp[n]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[n]` is set to `aseg[n]`.***
