The code `aseg[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `aseg[r + 1]` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `aseg[r + 1]` was already set to `aseg[r + 1] - 1`. So, now it will be decreased by 1 more.

- Initially, `aseg[r + 1]` was `aseg[r + 1] - 1`.
- After the code runs, `aseg[r + 1]` will be `(aseg[r + 1] - 1) - 1 = aseg[r + 1] - 2`.

The other variables (`i`, `l`, `r`, `aseg[l]`, `along[l]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `aseg[l]` is `aseg[l] + 2`, `aseg[r + 1]` is `aseg[r + 1] - 2`, `along[l]` is `max(r + 1, along[l])`**
