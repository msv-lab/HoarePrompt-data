Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `aseg[1]` to `aseg[n]`, `along[i]` is the maximum value of `along` for all indices up to `i`, all other elements of `aseg` are 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `along[k]` (for \(1 \leq k \leq n + 1\)) is the maximum value of `r + 1` among all intervals processed for that `k`, and `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[n]` set to `aseg[n]` and `dp` for all other indices is 0. If `along[i] < 0`, then `dp[n - 1]` is `aseg[n]`. Otherwise, `dp[n - 1]` is `max(aseg[n], aseg[n - 1] + dp[along[n - 1]])`.***
