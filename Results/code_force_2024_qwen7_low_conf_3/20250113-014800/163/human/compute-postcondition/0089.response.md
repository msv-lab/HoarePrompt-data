The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1]`. Given that `i` equals `k - 1`, this means `dp[k - 1]` will be updated to the value of `dp[k]`.

The other variables (`aseg`, `along`, and `dp[k]`) remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals `k - 1`, `aseg` and `along` are properly initialized with valid values, and `dp[k - 1]` is now equal to `dp[k]`.**
