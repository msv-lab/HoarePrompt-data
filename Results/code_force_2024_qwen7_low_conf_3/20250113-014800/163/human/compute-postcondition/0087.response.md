Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals \( k \), `aseg` and `along` are properly initialized with valid values, and `dp[k]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[k + 1]` and `aseg[k] + dp[along[k]]` if `along[i]` is not less than 0. Otherwise, `dp[k]` remains equal to `dp[k + 1]`**.
