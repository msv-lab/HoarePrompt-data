The code snippet `aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]` updates the value of `aseg[i + 1]` by adding the value of `aseg[i]` to it. 

From the initial state:
- `i` is `m + 1`
- `aseg[m + 1]` is the original value of `aseg[m + 1]` plus `aseg[m]`
- `along[m + 1]` is `max(along[m + 1], along[m])`

Since `i` is `m + 1`, `i + 1` would be `m + 2`. Thus, `aseg[i + 1]` which is `aseg[m + 2]` is updated by adding `aseg[i]` which is `aseg[m + 1]` to it.

The new value of `aseg[m + 2]` will be `aseg[m + 1] + aseg[m + 1]` which simplifies to `2 * aseg[m + 1]`.

The other variables (`i` and `along[m + 1]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `aseg[m + 1]` is the original value of `aseg[m + 1]` plus `aseg[m]`, `aseg[m + 2]` is `2 * aseg[m + 1]`, and `along[m + 1]` is `max(along[m + 1], along[m])`**.
