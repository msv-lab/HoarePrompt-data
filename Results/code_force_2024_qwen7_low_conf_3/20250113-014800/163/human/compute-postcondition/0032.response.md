Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `aseg[1]` to `aseg[n]`, `along[i]` is the maximum value of `along` for all indices up to `i` and is currently less than 0, all other elements of `aseg` are 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `along[k]` (for \(1 \leq k \leq n + 1\)) is the maximum value of `r + 1` among all intervals processed for that `k`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements set to 0.***
