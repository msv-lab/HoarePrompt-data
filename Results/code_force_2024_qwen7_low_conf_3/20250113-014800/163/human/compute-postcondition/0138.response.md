Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 3`, `aseg[n]` is the cumulative sum of all increments and decrements, `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value in the `along` array, `n` must be greater than 0, and `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition: if `along[i] < 0`, then `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[n - 2]`; otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1], aseg[i] + dp[along[i]])`***
