Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is a non-negative integer (since the loop may not execute if `m` is 0), `i` is `m`, `aseg[l]` is `i + 1` for the last processed `l`, `aseg[r + 1]` is `-i - 1` for the last processed `r`, all other elements of `aseg` are 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `along[k]` (for \(1 \leq k \leq n + 1\)) is the maximum value of `r + 1` among all intervals processed for that `k`, `l` is the last integer from input, `r` is the last integer from input.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `m` times, updating the `aseg` array and the `along` list.
- For each iteration, `aseg[l]` is incremented by 1 and `aseg[r + 1]` is decremented by 1.
- `along[l]` is updated to be the maximum of `r + 1` and the current value of `along[l]`.

After `m` iterations, `i` will be `m`, and `aseg[l]` and `aseg[r + 1]` will reflect the cumulative effects of all updates. The `along` list will store the maximum values of `r + 1` for each segment.
