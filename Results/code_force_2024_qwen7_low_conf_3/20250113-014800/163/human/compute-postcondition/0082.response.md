`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp[i + 1]` and `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `aseg`, `along`, and `dp` are affected.

Since `i` equals `n`, the value of `dp[n]` is updated. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals `n`, `aseg` and `along` are properly initialized with valid values, along[i] is greater than or equal to 0; `dp[n]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[n + 1]` and `aseg[n] + dp[along[n]]`**
