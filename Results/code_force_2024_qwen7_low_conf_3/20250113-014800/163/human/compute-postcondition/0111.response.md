`aseg[r + 1]` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, which was `aseg[r + 1] - 2`. Therefore, the new value of `aseg[r + 1]` is `aseg[r + 1] - 3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `aseg[l]` is `aseg[l] + 3`, `aseg[r + 1]` is `aseg[r + 1] - 3`, `along[l]` is `max(r + 1, along[l])`**
