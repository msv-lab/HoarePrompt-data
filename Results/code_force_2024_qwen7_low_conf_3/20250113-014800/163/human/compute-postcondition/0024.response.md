According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range of `0` to `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `i` is within the range of `0` to `n-1`
- `along[i]` is updated to be `max(along[i], along[i - 1])`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will now be `i + 1`. Since `i` was within the range of `0` to `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) should still be within the same range.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is within the range of `1` to `n-1`
- `along[i]` is updated to be `max(along[i], along[i - 1])` (where `i` is now `i + 1`)

To clearly represent this in the required format:

State: **`i` is within the range of `1` to `n-1`, `along[i]` is updated to be `max(along[i], along[i - 1])`**
