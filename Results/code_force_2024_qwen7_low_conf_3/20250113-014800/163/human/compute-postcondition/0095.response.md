`n` and `m` are assigned the values of the integers obtained from the input split by a space. The values of `i`, `aseg`, `along`, and `dp[1]` are not affected by this input. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `n` and `m`, while keeping the original values of `i`, `aseg`, `along`, and `dp[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `i` equals 1, `aseg` and `along` are properly initialized with valid values, and `dp[1]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[2]` and `aseg[1] + dp[along[1]]` if `along[1]` is not less than 0. Otherwise, `dp[1]` remains equal to `dp[2]`.**
