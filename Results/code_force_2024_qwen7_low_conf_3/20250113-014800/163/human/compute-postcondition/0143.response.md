Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \(n\) and \(m\) such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It then reads \(m\) pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\). The function constructs a list `aseg` which keeps track of cumulative increments and decrements up to each index, and a list `along` which records the maximum right boundary encountered up to each index. It then calculates a dynamic programming array `dp` to find the maximum value based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the value stored in `dp[1]`. This process is repeated for each test case.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `m` is 0, the inner loops that process the pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) will not execute, resulting in an empty `aseg` and `along` list for that test case.
- If `along[i]` is always negative for all indices during the calculation of `dp`, the function will use the values from `dp[i+1]` only, leading to a different outcome compared to when `along[i]` contains valid values.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no explicit missing functionalities in the provided code. However, the code assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges, and it does not handle cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., non-integer inputs or out-of-range values).
