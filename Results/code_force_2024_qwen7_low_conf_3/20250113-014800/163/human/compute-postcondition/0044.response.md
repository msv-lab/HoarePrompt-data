Postcondition: ***`i` is \( n - 2 \); `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `aseg[1]` to `aseg[n - 1]`; `along[i]` is updated based on the loop body; all other elements of `aseg` are 0; `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `along[k]` (for \( 1 \leq k \leq n + 1 \)) is the maximum value of \( r + 1 \) among all intervals processed for that \( k \); `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[n]` set to `aseg[n]`, `dp[n - 1]` updated based on the values of `aseg[n - 1]` and `dp[along[n - 1]]`, and `dp[n - 2]` updated to `max(dp[n - 1], aseg[n - 2] + dp[along[n - 2]])`, and all other elements of `dp` are 0.***

This postcondition encompasses both the if and else parts, ensuring that the final state of the program variables (`i`, `aseg`, `along`, and `dp`) aligns with the possible outcomes of the if-else block, given the initial precondition.
