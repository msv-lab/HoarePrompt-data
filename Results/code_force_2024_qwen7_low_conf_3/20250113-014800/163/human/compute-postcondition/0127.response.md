The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `aseg[n]` is the cumulative sum of all increments and decrements
- `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value in the `along` array
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The current value of `along[i]` is less than 0

The only variable that gets updated is `dp[i]`, which now holds the value of `dp[i + 1]`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i + 1` would be `n`. Therefore, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n - 1]`) is set to `dp[n]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `aseg[n]` is the cumulative sum of all increments and decrements, `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value in the `along` array, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[n - 1]` is equal to `dp[n]`, and the current value of `along[i]` is less than 0**
