The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The previous values of `l` and `r` are overwritten by these new inputs. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aseg` is a list where the element at index `l` is 2 and the element at index `r + 1` is -2, `along` is a list where the element at index `l` is `max(r + 1, -1)` and all other elements are -1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
