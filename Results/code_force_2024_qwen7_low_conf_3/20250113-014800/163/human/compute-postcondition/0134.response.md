Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`; `aseg[n]` is the cumulative sum of all increments and decrements; `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value in the `along` array; if `along[i] < 0`, then `dp[n - 2]` is equal to `dp[n - 1]`; otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1]` and `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]`. `n` must be greater than 0.***
