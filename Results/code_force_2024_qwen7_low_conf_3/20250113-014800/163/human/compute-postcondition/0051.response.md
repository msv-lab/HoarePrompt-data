Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 1.
- `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element being 0.
- `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `aseg[1]` to `aseg[n]`.
- `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with each element being -1.
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[i]` set to the value determined by the loop for each index `i` from `n` to 0.
- `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.

### Loop:
```
for i in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` because `range(m)` generates values from `0` to `m-1`.
   - Since the initial value of `i` is `1`, we need to adjust `i` to `0` for the loop to start correctly.

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - The loop requires `m` to be at least `1` to ensure that there is at least one iteration of the loop.
   - Therefore, `m` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

3. **Other Variables (`aseg`, `along`, `dp`, `n`):**
   - These variables are not directly used in determining whether the loop can execute, but their values may change inside the loop.
   - They do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start, but their initial states should remain as given.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `m`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aseg` is [0, 0, ..., 0], `along` is [-1, -1, ..., -1], `dp` is a list of length `n + 2`, `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input**
