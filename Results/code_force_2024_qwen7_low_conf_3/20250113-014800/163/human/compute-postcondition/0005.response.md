`l` and `r` are assigned the values obtained from the input split and converted to integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the lists `aseg` and `along` are also not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer read from input, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements set to 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements set to -1, `l` is an integer from input, `r` is an integer from input**
