The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. This affects the values of `l` and `r`, which are now input integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `aseg[l]` is `aseg[l] + 2`, `aseg[r + 1]` is `aseg[r + 1] - 2`, `along[l]` is `max(r + 1, along[l])`**
