`aseg[r + 1]` is decremented by 1. Initially, `aseg[r + 1]` is -2. After the decrement, its value becomes -3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer read from input, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `aseg[l]` is 3, `aseg[r + 1]` is -3, all other elements of `aseg` are 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements set to -1 except `along[l]` which is now `r + 1`, `l` is an integer from input, `r` is an integer from input**
