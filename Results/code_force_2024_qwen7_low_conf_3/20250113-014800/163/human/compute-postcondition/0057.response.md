`l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers entered by the user, converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `i`, `m`, `aseg`, `along`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aseg` is [0, 0, ..., 0] with the element at index `l` equal to 1 and the element at index `r + 1` equal to -1, `along` is [-1, -1, ..., -1] with the element at index `l` equal to `r + 1`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aseg` is [0, 0, ..., 0] with the element at index `l` equal to 1 and the element at index `r + 1` equal to -1, `along` is [-1, -1, ..., -1] with the element at index `l` equal to `r + 1`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
