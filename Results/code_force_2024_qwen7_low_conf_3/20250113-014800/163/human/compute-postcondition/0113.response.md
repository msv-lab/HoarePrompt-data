Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `aseg[l]` for each `l` is the cumulative sum of all increments up to index `l` and decrements up to `l + 1`, `aseg[r + 1]` for each `r` is the cumulative sum of all increments up to index `r + 1` and decrements up to `r + 1`, `along[l]` for each `l` is the maximum of `r + 1` from all iterations where `l` was the starting point.**
