The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, it appears that the function processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it receives integers `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). Additionally, for each test case, it reads lines containing pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\).

Given the structure of the problem, the function likely iterates over a range defined by `t`, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each iteration, it processes `n` and `m` along with the pairs \(l_i\) and \(r_i\).

Since the exact return value is not specified in the problem statement, we will focus solely on the input parameters and their relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it receives integers `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and for each test case, it reads lines containing pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\).**
