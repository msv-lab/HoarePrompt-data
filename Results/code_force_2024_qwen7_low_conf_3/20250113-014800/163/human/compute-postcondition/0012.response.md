The code `aseg[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `aseg[r + 1]` by 1. Given the initial state, `aseg[r + 1]` is initially -1. After decrementing, it will become -2.

- All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer read from input, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `aseg[l]` is 2, `aseg[r + 1]` is -2, all other elements of `aseg` are 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements set to -1 except `along[l]` which is now `r + 1`, `l` is an integer from input, `r` is an integer from input**
