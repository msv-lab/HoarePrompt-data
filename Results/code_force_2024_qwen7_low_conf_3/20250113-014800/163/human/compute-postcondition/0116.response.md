The code `aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]` updates the value of `aseg[i + 1]` by adding the value of `aseg[i]` to it. Given that `i` is `m - 1`, we can substitute `m - 1` for `i` in the code to get `aseg[m] += aseg[m - 1]`. This means that the value of `aseg[m]` is now the sum of its original value and `aseg[m - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `m - 1`, `aseg[m]` is the original value of `aseg[m]` plus `aseg[m - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `aseg[m]` is the original value of `aseg[m]` plus `aseg[m - 1]`**
