The code decrements `aseg[r + 1]` by 1. Given that `aseg[l]` was previously increased by 1, the value of `aseg[r + 1]` will be reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `aseg[l]` is increased by 1, `aseg[r + 1]` is decreased by 1**
