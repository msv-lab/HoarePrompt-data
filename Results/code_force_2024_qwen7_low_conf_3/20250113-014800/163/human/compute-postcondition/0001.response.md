The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them into integers before assigning them to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the newly introduced variables `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer read from input; `m` is an integer read from input.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer read from input; `m` is an integer read from input.**
