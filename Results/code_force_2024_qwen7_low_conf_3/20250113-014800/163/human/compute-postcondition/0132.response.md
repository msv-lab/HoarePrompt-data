The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n - 2`, the value of `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n - 2]`) is updated to be the same as `dp[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`; `aseg[n]` is the cumulative sum of all increments and decrements; `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value in the `along` array; `dp[n - 2]` is equal to `dp[n - 1]; n` must be greater than 0**
