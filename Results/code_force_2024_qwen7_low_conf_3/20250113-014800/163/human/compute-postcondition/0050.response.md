The code initializes `along` as a list of `-1` with a length of `n + 2`. This means that every element in the `along` list is now set to `-1`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `i` is 1.
- `aseg` is a list created as `[0] * (n + 2)`.
- `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `aseg[1]` to `aseg[n]`.
- `along[i]` is the maximum value of `along` for all indices up to `i`.
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[i]` set to the value determined by the loop for each index `i` from `n` to 0.
- `n` and `m` are assigned values from the input.

After executing the line `along = [-1] * (n + 2)`, the following changes occur:
- The `along` list is updated to contain `-1` at every index from `0` to `n + 1`.

The other variables (`i`, `aseg`, `dp`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1; `aseg` is `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of length `n + 2` with each element being 0); `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `aseg[1]` to `aseg[n]`; `along` is `[-1, -1, ..., -1]` (a list of length `n + 2` with each element being -1); `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with `dp[i]` set to the value determined by the loop for each index `i` from `n` to 0; `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.**
