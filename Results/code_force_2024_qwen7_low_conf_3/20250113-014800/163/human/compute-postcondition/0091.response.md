Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals `k - 1`, `aseg` and `along` are properly initialized with valid values, and `dp[k - 1]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[k]` and `aseg[k - 1] + dp[along[k - 1]]` if `along[i]` is not less than 0. Otherwise, `dp[k - 1]` remains equal to `dp[k]`.***
