`i` is adjusted to 0 to ensure the loop starts executing. The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them, converting each to an integer, and assigns them to `l` and `r` respectively. The value of `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
