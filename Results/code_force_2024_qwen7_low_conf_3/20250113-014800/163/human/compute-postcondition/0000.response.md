To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the structure of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means there are \(t\) test cases to process.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- Each line within the loop reads two integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\).

### Loop Structure:
The loop is structured as follows:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates based on the number of test cases specified by `t`. The loop continues as long as `int(input())` provides input values for `t`.

2. **Input Handling**: The loop body (which is currently omitted) will process the input values for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, the loop will read pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\).

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - The variable `t` is already provided, and we know its range is \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, the values of `n` and `m` will be provided.
   - The pairs \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) will be read from the input within the loop.

4. **Loop Execution Requirement**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, the input `t` must provide valid values that indicate there are indeed `t` test cases to process.
   - Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer within the given range.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `t` is the only variable that determines whether the loop will execute (by providing the number of test cases), the initial state of `t` must be valid for the loop to proceed.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected, iterating `t` times to process each test case.
