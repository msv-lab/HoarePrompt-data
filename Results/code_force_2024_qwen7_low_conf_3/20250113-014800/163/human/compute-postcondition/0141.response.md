Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` where `aseg[i]` is the cumulative sum of increments and decrements up to index `i`, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where `along[i]` is the maximum right boundary encountered up to index `i`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` where `dp[i]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop for each index `i` from `n` to `1`, and the final value of `dp[1]` is printed.**
