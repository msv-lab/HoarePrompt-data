Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `aseg[n]` is the cumulative sum of all increments and decrements, `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value in the `along` array, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `along[i]` is less than 0, then `dp[n - 1]` is equal to `dp[n]`. Otherwise, `dp[n - 1]` is the maximum of `dp[n]` and `aseg[n - 1] + dp[along[n - 1]]`.***
