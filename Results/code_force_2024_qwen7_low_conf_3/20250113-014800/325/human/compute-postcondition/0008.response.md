The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `index` was 2, so after incrementing, `index` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of only characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 3, `num_cases` is a positive integer (i.e., the integer value of `data[0]` is a positive number), `results` is an empty list**
