Output State: **`index` is `num_cases + 1`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for each case, `data` is a list of strings, `s` is the last string processed, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the presence of '1's in the string `s` from index `-1` to `n-1`, `n` is the number of cases processed, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for the last case.** 

Explanation:
1. The loop runs `num_cases` times. After the loop completes, `index` will be incremented by `num_cases` and will be set to `num_cases + 1`.
2. For each case, `n` and `s` are updated, and `dp` is recalculated based on the new `s`. The result for each case is stored in `results`.
3. After all cases are processed, `results` will contain the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for each case.
4. `data` remains unchanged except that `index` points to the position after the last `data` element used.
5. `s` will be the last string processed in the loop.
6. `dp` will be the last calculated `dp` list for the last processed case.
7. `result` will hold the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for the last processed case.
