The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. The other variables are updated as follows:

- `index` is incremented by 1.
- `s` is updated to be the next element in `data`, which is `data[index]`.

The initial state includes:
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is `sum_of_ones` and all other elements are `0`.
- `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element, now including `sum_of_ones`.
- `index` is increased by 1.
- `s` is the next element in `data`, which is `data[index]`.
- `result` is `sum_of_ones`.
- The loop counter `_` is `1`.

After executing the code snippet, the updated states are:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `index` is increased by 1.
- `s` is the next element in `data`, which is `data[index]`.

The output state is:
**`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is `sum_of_ones` and all other elements are `0`; `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element, now including `sum_of_ones`; `index` is increased by 1; `s` is the next element in `data`, which is `data[index]`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `result` is `sum_of_ones`; loop counter `_` is `1`.**
