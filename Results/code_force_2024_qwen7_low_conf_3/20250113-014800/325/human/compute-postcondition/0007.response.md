`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of strings read from `sys.stdin.read` and `index` is currently 1. The previous value of `n` was an integer between 1 and 100, and now it is replaced by the integer value of `data[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of only characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 2, `num_cases` is a positive integer (i.e., the integer value of `data[0]` is a positive number), `results` is an empty list**
