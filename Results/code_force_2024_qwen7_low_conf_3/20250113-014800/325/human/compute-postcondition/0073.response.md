The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. The value of `i` is either `n - 4` if `n - 3` was the previous value or `n - 2` if `n - 1` was the previous value. Since `dp[i]` is updated with `dp[i + 1]`, the value of `dp[i]` changes, but the value of `i` remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 4` if it was `n - 3`, or `n - 2` if it was `n - 1`; `dp[i]` is `dp[i + 1]`**
