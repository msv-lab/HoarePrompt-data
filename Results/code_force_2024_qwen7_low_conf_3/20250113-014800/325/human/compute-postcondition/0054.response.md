Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is `sum_of_ones` and all other elements are `0`.
   - `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element, now including `sum_of_ones`.
   - `index` is increased by 1.
   - `s` is the next element in `data`.
   - `result` is `sum_of_ones`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `num_cases` times.
   - The loop variable `_` is incremented from `0` to `num_cases - 1`.

3. **What Needs to Change for the Next Iteration?**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` must be incremented from its current value to the next value.
   - Since `_` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, it needs to become `1` for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only state that needs to change is the loop counter `_`, which should be set to `1` for the next iteration.
   - All other states (`dp`, `results`, `index`, `s`, `result`) remain unchanged for the next iteration since they are not directly affected by the loop counter.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is `sum_of_ones` and all other elements are `0`; `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element, now including `sum_of_ones`; `index` is increased by 1; `s` is the next element in `data`; `result` is `sum_of_ones`; loop counter `_` is `1`**.
