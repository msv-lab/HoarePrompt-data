Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 4, `num_cases` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list. If `s[i] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 3]` is `3 + dp[n - 2]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]`, where `i` is `n - 3` and `result` remains 0.***
