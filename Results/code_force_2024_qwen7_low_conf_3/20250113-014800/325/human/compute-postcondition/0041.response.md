The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`. Given that initially `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, this operation does not change the fact that `dp` is filled with zeros, except for the element at index `i` which now equals the element at index `i + 1`. 

The precondition that `n` is greater than or equal to 0 remains unchanged. Also, the list `results` is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, except `dp[i]` equals `dp[i + 1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and 0 as its last element, `s[i]` is not equal to '1'.**
