The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly. Instead, it implies that it is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case includes an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`.

For each test case:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of only characters '0' and '1'.

The sum of \(n^2\) over all test cases does not exceed \(10^4\).

Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, we can infer that the function returns the result of processing each test case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process multiple test cases internally, where each test case includes an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`, and return the result of processing these test cases.
