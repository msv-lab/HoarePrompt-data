`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `dp[0]` is now equal to `dp[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0]` is now `dp[1]` and all other elements are still 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and 0 as its last element, `index` is increased by 1, and `s` is the next element in `data`.**
