`index` is incremented by 1. Initially, `index` is 3, so after the increment, `index` becomes 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 4, `num_cases` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**
