The code `result += i` increments the value of `result` by the value of `i`. Initially, `i` is 0. Therefore, `result` is incremented by 0, which means `result` remains unchanged.

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0, `result` is 0, `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the stored input string, and `i` is 0.**
