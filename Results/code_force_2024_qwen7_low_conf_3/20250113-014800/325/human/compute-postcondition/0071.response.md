Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is decremented from `n - 2` to either `n - 3` or `n - 1`, depending on whether `s[i]` is '1'.
   - If `s[i]` is '1', then `dp[i]` is updated to `n - (n - 2) + dp[n - 1]`.
   - If `s[i]` is not '1', then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i + 1]`.
   - The state of `dp` and the string `s` remains unchanged for both cases.

2. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is being decremented, the current value of `i` is one of the values it was decremented to: either `n - 3` or `n - 1`.

3. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop will continue if `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `i` is currently `n - 3`, the next value of `i` will be `n - 4`.
   - If `i` is currently `n - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `n - 2`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i >= 0`.
   - Therefore, if `i` is `n - 3`, the next value of `i` is `n - 4` and it will still be valid (greater than or equal to 0).
   - If `i` is `n - 1`, the next value of `i` is `n - 2` and it will still be valid (greater than or equal to 0).

5. **Summary of Adjusted States:**
   - The value of `i` will decrease by 1 from its current value, which could be `n - 3` or `n - 1`.
   - The value of `i` will now be `n - 4` or `n - 2` respectively.

6. **State After the Next Iteration:**
   - The state of `dp` and the string `s` remains unchanged, so we don't need to adjust those.
   - The value of `i` will be `n - 4` if it was `n - 3` before, and `n - 2` if it was `n - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
**State: **`i` is `n - 4` if it was `n - 3`, or `n - 2` if it was `n - 1`**.
