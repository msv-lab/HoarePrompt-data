Let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
- `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`.
- `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and 0 as its last element.
- `index` is increased by 1.
- `s` is the next element in `data` (i.e., `data[index]`).

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[i] == '1':
        dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]
    else:
        dp[i] = dp[i + 1]
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Iteration (i = n - 1):**
   - If `s[n - 1] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 1] = n - (n - 1) + dp[n] = 1`.
   - If `s[n - 1] != '1'`, then `dp[n - 1] = dp[n] = 0`.

2. **Second Iteration (i = n - 2):**
   - If `s[n - 2] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 2] = n - (n - 2) + dp[n - 1] = 2 + dp[n - 1]`.
   - If `s[n - 2] != '1'`, then `dp[n - 2] = dp[n - 1]`.

3. **General Iteration (i = j):**
   - If `s[j] == '1'`, then `dp[j] = n - j + dp[j + 1]`.
   - If `s[j] != '1'`, then `dp[j] = dp[j + 1]`.

4. **Final State (i = 0):**
   - The loop continues to update `dp` from `n - 1` down to `0`.
   - By the time the loop reaches `i = 0`, `dp[0]` will be the cumulative sum of all positions where `s[i] == '1'` from `0` to `n - 1`.

### Conclusion:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the final state of the variables will be:

- `dp[0]` will be the sum of all positions where `s[i] == '1'` from `0` to `n - 1`.
- All other elements in `dp` from `dp[1]` to `dp[n]` will be `0` unless they were updated during the loop.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is the sum of all positions where `s[i] == '1'` from `0` to `n - 1`, and all other elements are `0`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element. `index` is increased by 1, and `s` is the next element in `data`.**
