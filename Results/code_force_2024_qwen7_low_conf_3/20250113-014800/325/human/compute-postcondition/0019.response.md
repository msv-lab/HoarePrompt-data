Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `s` is the value of `data[3]`
- `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`
- `index` is 4
- `num_cases` is a positive integer
- `results` is an empty list
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros
- `result` is 0
- `i` is initialized to `n - 1`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n - 1` to `i = 0` in reverse order.
2. **Initialization**: Initially, `i` is set to `n - 1`.
3. **Loop Execution**: In each iteration, `i` decreases by 1 until it reaches -1.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is currently `n - 1`
- Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2`.

### Required Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be set to `n - 2`.
- All other variables remain the same since the loop body is omitted, meaning no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, `index`, `num_cases`, `results`, `dp`, or `result` within the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 4, `num_cases` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `result` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`.**
