Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute based on the given initial states:

1. **Loop Execution Conditions**: The loop will run as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` should start from `n-1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
   - `s` is the value of `data[3]`
   - `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`
   - `index` is 4
   - `num_cases` is a positive integer
   - `results` is an empty list
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros
   - `result` is 0

3. **Adjusting States for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be set to the highest value of the range, which is `n - 1`.
   - Since the loop decrements `i`, we don't need to explicitly state this behavior but ensure `i` is correctly initialized.
   - We need to confirm that `n` is a valid positive integer because the range function will raise an error if `n` is not a positive integer.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be a positive integer (since `n - 1` must be a valid starting point for the range).
- `i` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 4, `num_cases` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `result` is 0, `i` is initialized to `n - 1`**
