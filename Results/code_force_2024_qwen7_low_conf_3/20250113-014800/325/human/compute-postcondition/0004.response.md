The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `index` is 0, so after executing `index += 1`, the new value of `index` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 1, `num_cases` is the integer value of `data[0]`**
