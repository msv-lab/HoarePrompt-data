The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` and an integer `n`, along with a binary string `s` of length `n`. The constraints for `t`, `n`, and the properties of `s` are given. However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, we need to infer the structure from the problem description.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- Each binary string `s` has length `n` and consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
- The sum of \(n^2\) over all test cases does not exceed \(10^4\).

Since the function signature does not include these parameters, we can infer that the function processes these inputs in a loop or through some other means not specified in the signature.

Based on the problem statement, the function likely processes multiple test cases and returns some form of result for each case. However, without a specific return type or value mentioned in the problem, we cannot specify a return value directly.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process multiple test cases involving an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`, under the given constraints, and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`, and returns a result for each test case.**
