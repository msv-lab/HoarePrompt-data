The code `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`, and the value of `s[i]` is '1'. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i + 1` would be `n`, and `dp[n]` needs to be considered. However, since `i + 1` is the next index, and there's no information about `dp[n]` in the initial state, we'll keep it as `dp[n]`.

Therefore, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n - 1]`) is updated to `n - (n - 1) + dp[n]`, which simplifies to `1 + dp[n]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, and `dp[n - 1]` is `1 + dp[n]`**
