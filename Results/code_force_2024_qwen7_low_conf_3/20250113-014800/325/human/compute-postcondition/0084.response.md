The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res`, which is the second element in the `results` list. The value of `index` remains unchanged because no operation affects it. The `results` list and `res` remain the same as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `index` is `num_cases + 2`, `res` is the second element in the `results` list**
