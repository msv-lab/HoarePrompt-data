Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0, `result` is 0, `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the stored input string, and `i` is 0 (or the loop does not execute if `length` is 0). If `input_string[i]` is '1' for any `i`, `dp[i]` is updated accordingly, otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 0.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution:** The loop iterates from `length - 1` down to 0.
- **DP Array Update:** For each index `i`:
  - If `input_string[i]` is '1', then `dp[i]` is set to `length - i + dp[i + 3]`.
  - If `input_string[i]` is '0', then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i + 1]`.

### Final State Analysis:
- **Final Value of `i`:** After the loop completes, `i` will be 0, unless `length` is 0, in which case the loop does not execute and `i` remains undefined (or we can consider it as having not been assigned).
- **DP Array Values:** The final values in `dp` depend on the values of `input_string`. Specifically:
  - If `input_string[i]` is '1' for any `i`, the corresponding `dp[i]` will be updated based on the formula `length - i + dp[i + 3]`.
  - If `input_string[i]` is '0' for any `i`, the corresponding `dp[i]` will retain its previous value, which was set to 0 initially and then updated based on subsequent '1' values.

### Special Case:
- If `length` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all values remain as initialized:
  - `dp` remains `[0] * (length + 10)`.
  - `result` remains 0.
  - `i` remains undefined.

Thus, the final output state captures the behavior both when the loop does and does not execute.
