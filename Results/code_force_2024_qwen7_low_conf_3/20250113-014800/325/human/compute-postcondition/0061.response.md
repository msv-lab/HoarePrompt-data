Let's break down the given information and the for loop to understand which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where all elements are `0`.
- `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element, now including `sum_of_ones`.
- `index` is `index + 1`.
- `s` is the next element in `data`, which is `data[index]`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `result` is `0`.
- Loop counter `_` is `1`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).
   - The loop counter `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by `1` each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - At the start of the loop, `i` must be equal to `n - 1` for the first iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`, and so on.

3. **Value of `n`**:
   - `n` is derived from `data[index]` and is the length of the `dp` list minus `1`.
   - Therefore, `n` should be at least `1` for the loop to start executing.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `index`, `s`, `result`, and `results` are not directly involved in the loop condition but might be modified inside the loop.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be `n - 1` for the first iteration.
- `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to start executing.
- All other variables (`dp`, `results`, `index`, `s`, `result`) are already set correctly based on the given initial state.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 1**

This ensures that the loop can start executing from the first iteration.
