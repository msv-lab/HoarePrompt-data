The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `s`, `data`, `index`, `num_cases`, and `results` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `dp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 4, `num_cases` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros**.
