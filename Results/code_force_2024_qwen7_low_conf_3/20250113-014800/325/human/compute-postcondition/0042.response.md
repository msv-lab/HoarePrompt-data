Postcondition: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros. If `s[i]` is '1', then `dp` is updated such that each element from `dp[0]` to `dp[n]` represents the sum of consecutive ones in `s` up to index `i`. `n` is greater than 0. `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and 0 as its last element. `index` is increased by 1, and `s` is the next element in `data` (i.e., `data[index]`). If `s[i]` is not '1', then `dp[i]` equals `dp[i + 1]`.**
