According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `dp` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `num_cases` is a non-negative integer
- `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace
- `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0
- `result` is 0
- `length` is a positive integer
- `input_string` is the stored input string
- `i` is 0

The loop `for i in dp:` iterates over each element in the `dp` list. Since `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`, the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = length + 9`.

At the start of the first iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should now be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0, `result` is 0, `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the stored input string, and `i` is 1**.
