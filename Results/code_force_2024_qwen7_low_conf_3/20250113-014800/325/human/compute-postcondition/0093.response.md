According to the code, the loop iterates over the `dp` list. The variable `i` is expected to iterate over the indices of the `dp` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `num_cases` is a non-negative integer
- `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace
- `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0
- `result` is 1
- `length` is a positive integer
- `input_string` is the stored input string
- `i` is 1

The loop starts iterating from the first element of the `dp` list since `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to the next index of the `dp` list. Therefore, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0, `result` is 1, `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the stored input string, `i` is 2**
