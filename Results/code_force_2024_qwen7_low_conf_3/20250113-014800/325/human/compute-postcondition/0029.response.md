The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, and `dp` and `n` remain unchanged, the only new information is that `results` now contains the `result` as its last element.

Output State: **`result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` as its last element.**
