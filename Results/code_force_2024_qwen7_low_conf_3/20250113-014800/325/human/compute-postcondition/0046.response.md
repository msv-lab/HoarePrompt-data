Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and 0 as its last element, `index` is increased by 1, and `s` is the next element in `data`. If `s[i]` equals '1', `dp[0]` remains 0; otherwise, `dp[0]` becomes `dp[1]` and all other elements remain 0.***
