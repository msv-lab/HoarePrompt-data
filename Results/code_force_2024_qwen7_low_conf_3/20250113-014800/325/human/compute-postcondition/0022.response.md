Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 4, `num_cases` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where either `dp[n - 2]` is 2 (if `s[i] == '1'`), or `dp[n - 2]` equals `dp[n - 1]` (if `s[i] != '1'`), `result` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`.***
