Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', then `dp[i]` is `1 + dp[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]`.
   - The character at index `i` in string `s` is not '1'.

2. **Loop Range:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means it starts from `n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current State:**
   - Since we are at the end of the previous iteration where `i` is `n - 1`, the loop has already executed for `i = n - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n - 2`.

5. **Conditions to Check:**
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged, so `n` must still be at least 1.
   - We need to check the character at the new index `i` (which is now `n - 2`) in the string `s`.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be `n - 2`.
   - `n` must still be at least 1.
   - The state of `dp` and the string `s` does not change because we are only decrementing `i` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least 1**.
