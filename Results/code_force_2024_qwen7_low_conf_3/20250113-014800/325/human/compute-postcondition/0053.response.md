`results` is a list, and the code appends `result` to it. The value of `result` is `sum_of_ones`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is `sum_of_ones` and all other elements are `0`; `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element, now including `sum_of_ones`; `index` is increased by 1; `s` is the next element in `data`; `result` is `sum_of_ones`.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is `sum_of_ones` and all other elements are `0`; `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element, now including `sum_of_ones`; `index` is increased by 1; `s` is the next element in `data`; `result` is `sum_of_ones`.**
