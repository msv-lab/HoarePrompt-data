The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Given the initial state where `index` is increased by 1, the new value of `index` will be the original value of `index` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is `sum_of_ones` and all other elements are `0`; `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and `0` as its last element, now including `sum_of_ones`; `index` is `index + 1`; `s` is the next element in `data`, which is `data[index]`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `result` is `sum_of_ones`; loop counter `_` is `1`.**
