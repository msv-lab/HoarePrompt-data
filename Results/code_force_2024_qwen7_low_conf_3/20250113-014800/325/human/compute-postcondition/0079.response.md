Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State Before the Loop
- `index` is `num_cases + 1`
- `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for each case
- `data` is a list of strings
- `s` is the last string processed
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the presence of '1's in the string `s` from index `-1` to `n-1`
- `n` is the number of cases processed
- `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for the last case

### Analysis of the For Loop
The loop iterates over the `results` list:
```python
for res in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initialization and Range**: The loop will iterate over every element in the `results` list. Therefore, `results` must contain at least one element to ensure the loop can execute.
2. **Accessing Elements**: Each element `res` in the `results` list is being processed within the loop. Hence, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty and contains valid elements.

### Required Adjustments
Given the analysis, we need to ensure that the `results` list is not empty and contains valid elements. The initial value of `index` (`num_cases + 1`) is irrelevant to the loop's execution since the loop depends on the `results` list.

### Final State Before the Loop Execution
State: **`results` must be a non-empty list, `index` is `num_cases + 1`, `data` is a list of strings, `s` is the last string processed, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the presence of '1's in the string `s` from index `-1` to `n-1`, `n` is the number of cases processed, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for the last case.**

In summary, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `results` must be a non-empty list.
