The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, `index`, and `num_cases`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 1, `num_cases` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list**.
