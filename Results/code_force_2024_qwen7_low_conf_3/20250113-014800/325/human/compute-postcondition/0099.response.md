Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer `t` and an integer `n`, followed by a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it computes a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element is either 0 or a positive integer calculated based on the input string. It then sums up all elements in the `dp` array except the first one and prints the result using the `Decimal` class. The function ensures that the sum of \(n^2\) over all test cases does not exceed \(10^4\). Potential edge cases include handling the boundary conditions for the dynamic programming array length (`length + 10`).**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
- Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the binary string and the binary string itself.
- Initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `length + 10`.
- Populates the `dp` array based on the binary string, where `dp[i]` is updated according to the value of `input_string[i]`.
- Sums up all elements in the `dp` array except the first one.
- Prints the sum using the `Decimal` class to ensure precision.

**Missing functionality:**
- The code does not handle cases where the binary string is empty or contains invalid characters other than '0' and '1'.
- The code does not validate the input values of `t` and `n` beyond their specified ranges.
