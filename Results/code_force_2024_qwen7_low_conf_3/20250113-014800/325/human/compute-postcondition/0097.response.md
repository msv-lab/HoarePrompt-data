Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is a sequence of '0's and '1's, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` where each element is either 0 or a positive integer calculated based on the input string, `result` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list except `dp[0]`, and the value of `result` is printed using the `Decimal` class.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `num_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, initially 0 or more.
   - For each test case, `length` is read as a positive integer from the input.
   - `input_string` is a sequence of '0's and '1's read from the input.
   - `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`, initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs `num_cases` times.
   - For each test case:
     - `length` is set to the length of `input_string`.
     - `dp` is initialized to a list of length `length + 10`, all elements set to 0.
     - `result` is initialized to 0.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs from `length - 1` down to 0.
   - For each index `i`:
     - If `input_string[i]` is '1', `dp[i]` is updated to `length - i + dp[i + 3]`.
     - If `input_string[i]` is '0', `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i + 1]`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After the inner loop, `result` is the sum of all elements in `dp` except `dp[0]`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The value of `result` is printed using the `Decimal` class.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loops have finished, the variables will have the following states:
- `t` remains as an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `num_cases` will be the total number of test cases processed.
- `input_string` will be the last sequence of '0's and '1's read.
- `dp` will be a list of length `length + 10` where each element is either 0 or a positive integer calculated based on the input string.
- `result` will be the sum of all elements in `dp` except `dp[0]`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is a sequence of '0's and '1's, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` where each element is either 0 or a positive integer calculated based on the input string, `result` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list except `dp[0]`, and the value of `result` is printed using the `Decimal` class.**
