According to the code, the loop iterates `num_cases` times. The loop body is omitted, but we know that the state at the end of the previous iteration includes:

- `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`.
- `dp` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` as its last element.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the following states:

- `result` will be recalculated as the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` again.
- `results` will be updated to include this new `result` as its last element.

Given that the loop is about to start another iteration, we can conclude:

- `result` will be calculated again for the current case.
- `results` will be extended to include the new `result`.

State: **`result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and the new result as its last element**.
