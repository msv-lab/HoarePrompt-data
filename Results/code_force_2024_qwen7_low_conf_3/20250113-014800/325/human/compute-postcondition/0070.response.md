Postcondition: ***`i` is decremented from `n - 2` to either `n - 3` or `n - 1`, depending on whether `s[i]` is '1'. If `s[i]` is '1', then `dp[i]` is updated to `n - (n - 2) + dp[n - 1]`. If `s[i]` is not '1', then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i + 1]`. The state of `dp` and the string `s` remains unchanged for both cases.***
