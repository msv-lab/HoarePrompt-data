The value of `i` is 2, and the `result` variable is initially 1. The code `result += i` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to `result`. Therefore, the new value of `result` is 1 + 2, which is 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0, `result` is 3, `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the stored input string, `i` is 2**
