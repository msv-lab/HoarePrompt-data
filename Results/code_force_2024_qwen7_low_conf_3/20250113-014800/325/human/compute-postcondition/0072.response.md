The code updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the current values of `n`, `i`, and `dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 2`, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `i` is `n - 4`:
   - The new value of `dp[i]` is `n - (n - 4) + dp[n - 3]` which simplifies to `4 + dp[n - 3]`.
2. If `i` is `n - 2`:
   - The new value of `dp[i]` is `n - (n - 2) + dp[n - 1]` which simplifies to `2 + dp[n - 1]`.

Since `i` can only be `n - 4` or `n - 2`, and no other initial values are provided for `dp[n - 3]` and `dp[n - 1]`, these are kept as they are.

Output State: **`i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 2`; `dp[i]` is updated to `4 + dp[n - 3]` if `i` is `n - 4`, or `2 + dp[n - 1]` if `i` is `n - 2`; `dp[n - 3]` and `dp[n - 1]` remain unchanged.**
