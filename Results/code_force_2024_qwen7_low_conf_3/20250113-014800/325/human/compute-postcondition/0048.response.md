Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and 0 as its last element
   - `s` is the next element in `data`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula provided.
   - Given `i` is initially 0, the formula becomes `dp[0] = n - 0 + dp[1]`, which simplifies to `dp[0] = n + dp[1]`.

3. **Impact**:
   - `dp[0]` is updated to `n + dp[1]`.
   - The other elements of `dp` (except `dp[0]`) remain unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented but is not used further in this snippet, so its value remains 0.
   - The other variables (`n`, `results`, `s`, and `data`) are not affected by this operation.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - `dp[0]` is now `n + dp[1]`.
   - All other elements of `dp` remain as they were initially.

5. **Output State**:
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element updated to `n + dp[1]`.
   - `i` is still 0.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of the updated `dp` and 0 as its last element.
   - `s` is the next element in `data`.

Given the above, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element `dp[0]` equal to `n + dp[1]`; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and 0 as its last element; `s` is the next element in `data`.**
