Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is a non-empty list.
   - `index` is `num_cases + 1`.
   - `data` is a list of strings.
   - `s` is the last string processed.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the presence of '1's in the string `s` from index `-1` to `n-1`.
   - `n` is the number of cases processed.
   - `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for the last case.
   - `res` is the first element in the `results` list.
   - The value of `res` is printed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for res in results:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - The variable `res` takes on the value of each element in the `results` list one by one.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, the key variables that need adjustment are `res` and `index`.
   - `index` should be incremented to reflect the next iteration in the list.
   - `res` will take on the value of the next element in the `results` list.

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - `results` remains the same since it is being iterated over.
   - `index` needs to be updated to `num_cases + 2` because we are moving to the next element in the list.
   - `res` will be set to the next element in the `results` list.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `results` remains the same.
- `index` is updated to `num_cases + 2`.
- `res` is set to the next element in the `results` list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `index` is `num_cases + 2`, `res` is the second element in the `results` list**
