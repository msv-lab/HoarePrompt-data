To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start iterating over the `dp` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `dp` list. The loop will execute as long as `dp` is iterable, which it always is since `dp` is a list.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the problem's initial state. The loop body is omitted, but the important part here is that `i` will increment within the loop.

3. **List Iteration**: The loop will iterate over the `dp` list, meaning `i` will take on values from `0` to `len(dp) - 1`.

4. **Initial Value of `i`**: Given that `i` is initially set to `0`, the loop will execute at least once if `dp` contains at least one element.

5. **DP List Length**: The length of `dp` is `length + 10`, and `length` is a positive integer. Therefore, `dp` will always contain at least 10 elements (and more if `length > 0`).

6. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: Since `dp` is a list and always contains at least 10 elements, the loop will execute at least once regardless of the value of `length`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `i`, which should be `0` to ensure the loop starts executing.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0, `result` is 0, `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the stored input string, and `i` is 0.**

This ensures that the loop can start executing.
