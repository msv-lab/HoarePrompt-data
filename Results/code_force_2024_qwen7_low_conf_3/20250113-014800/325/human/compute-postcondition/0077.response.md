The code `results.append(result)` appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `dp`, `s`, or `result` directly. It only adds a new element to the list `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is -1
- `n` is at least 1
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the presence of '1's in the string `s` from index `-1` to `n-1`
- `s` is the string being processed
- `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`

After the code executes, the value of `results` will include the current value of `result`, but no changes are made to `i`, `n`, `dp`, `s`, or `result`.

Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the presence of '1's in the string `s` from index `-1` to `n-1`, `s` is the string being processed, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, and `results` is a list containing the current value of `result`.**
