The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to `n - i + dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `n - 1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:

- `i` is `n - 1`.
- So, `dp[i]` becomes `dp[n - 1]`.

The equation now looks like this: 
\[ dp[n - 1] = n - (n - 1) + dp[n] \]
Simplifying the right side:
\[ dp[n - 1] = 1 + dp[n] \]

Since `dp` is initialized with zeros, `dp[n]` is 0. Substituting this in:
\[ dp[n - 1] = 1 + 0 \]
\[ dp[n - 1] = 1 \]

All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 4, `num_cases` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except for `dp[n - 1]` which is 1, `result` is 0, `i` is initialized to `n - 1`.**
