Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `n` must be at least 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `dp[i]` is the sum of the indices from `i` to `n-1` in the string `s` if there is a '1' at those indices, otherwise it is equal to `dp[i+1]`. The state of `dp` is such that if `s[i]` is '1', then `dp[i]` is updated to `n - i + dp[i + 1]`, otherwise `dp[i]` is `dp[i + 1]`. The variable `results` contains the sum of all elements in `dp` except the last element, and `s` is the string being processed.**
