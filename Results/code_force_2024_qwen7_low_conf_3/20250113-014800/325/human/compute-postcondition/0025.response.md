The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is set to `n - 3` initially.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `s` is the value of `data[3]`
- `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`
- `index` is 4
- `num_cases` is a positive integer
- `results` is an empty list
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where either `dp[n - 2]` is 2 (if `s[i] == '1'`), or `dp[n - 2]` equals `dp[n - 1]` (if `s[i] != '1'`)
- `result` is 0
- `i` is `n - 3`

After executing `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\); `n` is a positive integer; `s` is the value of `data[3]`; `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`; `index` is 4; `num_cases` is a positive integer; `results` is an empty list; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where either `dp[n - 2]` is 2 (if `s[i] == '1'`), or `dp[n - 2]` equals `dp[n - 1]` (if `s[i] != '1'`); `result` is 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]`.**
