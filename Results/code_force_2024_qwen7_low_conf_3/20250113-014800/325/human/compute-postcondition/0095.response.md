Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `num_cases` is a non-negative integer, `input_string` is the stripped input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with all elements set to 0, `result` is equal to the sum of all non-zero elements in `dp`, `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the stored input string, and `i` is `length`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs for each element in the `dp` list. Since `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` initialized to 0, the loop will run exactly `length` times (from index 0 to `length-1`).

2. **Update of `result`**: For each iteration, `result` is incremented by the value of the current element in `dp`. Initially, all elements in `dp` are 0, so the loop updates `result` only when `dp[i]` becomes non-zero due to some condition outside the loop.

3. **Final Values**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is an input parameter.
   - `num_cases` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified elsewhere in the code.
   - `input_string` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` remains a list of length `length + 10` initialized to 0 unless updated inside the loop.
   - `result` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `dp` after the loop completes.
   - `i` is the last index of `dp` that was processed, which is `length - 1`.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**: If `length` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values of `result`, `i`, and `dp` remain as initially set (all elements in `dp` are 0, and `result` is 0).
