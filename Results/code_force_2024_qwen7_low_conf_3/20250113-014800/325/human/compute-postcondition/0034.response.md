The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The initial state includes that `index` is increased by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` and the new result as its last element; `index` is increased by 1 (new value is `index + 1`); `s` is `data[index]`**
