The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the sum of indices from `i` to `n-1` that are marked as '1' in the string `s`. The function then sums up the first `n` elements of `dp` and appends this sum to the `results` list. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in the `results` list. The function handles edge cases such as empty input strings or test cases where `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, `dp` is initialized with a single element `0`, and the result is directly set to 0 since there are no indices to sum.
