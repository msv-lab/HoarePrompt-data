Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the binary string `s`.
3. It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `n + 1` to store intermediate results.
4. The DP array `dp` is filled in reverse order, where `dp[i]` is calculated based on whether the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '1'. If it is '1', then `dp[i]` is `n - i + dp[i + 1]`, otherwise, it is `dp[i + 1]`.
5. The result for each test case is the sum of the first `n` elements of the DP array `dp`.
6. The final result for each test case is appended to the `results` list, and after all test cases are processed, the results are printed.

Based on the provided execution summary and the analysis of the program's logic, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
