You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on t and n . You can make hacks only if both
versions of the problem are solved.

For a binary^\dagger pattern p and a binary string q , both of length m , q is
called p -good if for every i (1 \leq i \leq m ), there exist indices l and r
such that:

  * 1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq m , and 
  * p_i is a mode^\ddagger of the string q_l q_{l+1} \ldots q_{r} . 

For a pattern p , let f(p) be the minimum possible number of \mathtt{1} s in a
p -good binary string (of the same length as the pattern).

You are given a binary string s of size n . Find

In other words, you need to sum the values of f over all \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
substrings of s .

^\dagger A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters
\mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

^\ddagger Character c is a mode of string t of length m if the number of
occurrences of c in t is at least \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil . For example,
\mathtt{0} is a mode of \mathtt{010} , \mathtt{1} is not a mode of
\mathtt{010} , and both \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} are modes of \mathtt{011010}
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the binary string s .

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n
consisting of only characters \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 10^4
.

Output

For each test case, output the sum of values of f over all substrings of s .

Output

    1
    2
    0
    346
    
Note

In the first test case, the only \mathtt{1} -good string is \mathtt{1} . Thus,
f(\mathtt{1})=1 .

In the second test case, f(\mathtt{10})=1 because \mathtt{01} is \mathtt{10}
-good, and \mathtt{00} is not \mathtt{10} -good. Thus, the answer is
f(\mathtt{1})+f(\mathtt{10})+f(\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 .

In the third test case, f equals to 0 for all 1 \leq i \leq j \leq 5 . Thus,
the answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the binary string `n` and the binary string `s`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to calculate the minimum possible number of '1's in a p-good binary string for each substring. Specifically, it iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, updating the `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of '1's for the substring starting at `i` and ending at `n-1`. If the current character is '1', it adds the length of the remaining substring to `dp[i+1]` (which accounts for the minimum '1's needed if we include this '1'). Otherwise, it just takes the value from `dp[i+1]`.
3. **Result Calculation**: After computing the `dp` array for each substring, it sums up the values of `dp` for the full length of the string and appends it to the results list.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and implementation, the program appears to be following the requirements accurately and correctly handling the constraints and problem statement.
