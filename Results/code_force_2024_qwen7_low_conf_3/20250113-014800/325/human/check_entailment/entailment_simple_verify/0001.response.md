### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the binary string `n` and the binary string `s`. This part is correct.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of '1's required for the substring `s[i:]`.
   - It iterates through the string from the end to the beginning, updating the `dp` array based on the presence of '1's.
   - If the current character is '1', it sets `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]`, which means it adds the length of the remaining substring to `dp[i + 1]` to account for the minimum '1's needed if the current '1' is included.
   - If the current character is '0', it simply sets `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]`.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - After computing the `dp` array for each substring, it sums up the values of `dp` for the full length of the string and appends it to the results list.
   - This step correctly calculates the minimum number of '1's for the entire string, but the issue lies in the way it handles the substrings.

4. **Substrings Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the substrings correctly. It only calculates the `dp` for the entire string and sums it up, which is incorrect. According to the problem, it needs to calculate the minimum number of '1's for all substrings of the string `s`.
   - The program should iterate through all possible substrings and compute the `dp` for each substring separately.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, but the results are incorrect because it does not consider all substrings.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the program correctly handles all substrings. The actual implementation only considers the entire string and does not compute the minimum number of '1's for each substring.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
