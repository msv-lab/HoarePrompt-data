Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`.
2. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the sum of indices from `i` to `n-1` that are marked as '1' in the string `s`.
3. The program correctly updates the `dp` array in a reverse manner, ensuring that the value of `dp[i]` includes contributions from all subsequent positions in the string.
4. After updating the `dp` array, it calculates the required sum for each test case and appends it to the `results` list.
5. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic of calculating the sum of indices for '1's in the string `s` and using dynamic programming to efficiently compute the required value for each substring is sound. Given the constraints, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified limits.

Correctness: **True**
