### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the binary string `n` and the binary string `s`. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to calculate the minimum possible number of '1's in a p-good binary string for each substring. However, the logic for updating the `dp` array is flawed. Specifically, the comment "If the current character is '1', it adds the length of the remaining substring to `dp[i+1]` (which accounts for the minimum '1's needed if we include this '1')." is incorrect. The `dp[i]` should represent the minimum number of '1's in any p-good string starting from position `i` and extending to the end of the string. Instead, the program incorrectly sums the positions of '1's from the current index to the end of the string, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of '1's in a p-good string.

   - Here's the flawed logic in detail:
     ```python
     for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
         if s[i] == '1':
             dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]
         else:
             dp[i] = dp[i + 1]
     ```
     If `s[i] == '1'`, the current logic adds `n - i` to `dp[i + 1]`. This means that if there is a '1' at index `i`, the program is essentially counting the number of indices from `i` to `n-1` that are '1's, which is not the correct approach to finding the minimum number of '1's in a p-good string.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - After computing the `dp` array for each substring, the program sums up the values of `dp` for the full length of the string and appends it to the results list. This step is correct but is based on an incorrect `dp` calculation.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for each test case. This part is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is correct. The core issue lies in the dynamic programming approach used to calculate the minimum number of '1's in a p-good string. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
