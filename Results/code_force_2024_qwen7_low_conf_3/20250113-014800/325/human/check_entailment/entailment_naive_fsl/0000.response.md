Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum number of 1s in a p-good binary string for all substrings of `s`. However, the logic within the `func_1` function has several issues:

1. **Incorrect DP Calculation**: The DP array `dp` is intended to store the minimum number of 1s for substrings ending at each position. However, the calculation inside the loop is flawed. It does not properly account for the mode condition required for a substring to be p-good.

2. **Mode Condition Not Implemented**: The program does not check whether a substring meets the mode condition for the pattern `p`. Instead, it simply accumulates the number of 1s without considering the mode requirement.

3. **Input Reading and Processing**: The input reading logic is somewhat confusing and might lead to issues if the input format is not strictly adhered to. However, the primary issue lies in the core logic of calculating the DP values.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Substrings: "1", "0", "1", "10", "01", "101"
- For "1": Minimum number of 1s is 1 (itself).
- For "0": Minimum number of 1s is 0 (empty string or "0" itself).
- For "10": Minimum number of 1s is 1 ("1").
- For "01": Minimum number of 1s is 1 ("1").
- For "101": Minimum number of 1s is 1 ("1").

Summing these up, we get 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. However, the program calculates something different due to its incorrect logic.

Since the program fails to correctly calculate the minimum number of 1s for substrings based on the mode condition, it is incorrect.
