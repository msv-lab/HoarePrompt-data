Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the binary string `n` and the binary string `s`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to calculate the minimum possible number of '1's in a p-good binary string for each substring. Specifically, it iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, updating the `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of '1's for the substring starting at `i` and ending at `n-1`. If the current character is '1', it adds the length of the remaining substring to `dp[i+1]` (which accounts for the minimum '1's needed if we include this '1'). Otherwise, it just takes the value from `dp[i+1]`.
3. **Result Calculation**: After computing the `dp` array for each substring, it sums up the values of `dp` for the full length of the string and appends it to the results list.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and implementation, the program appears to be following the requirements accurately and correctly handling the constraints and problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
