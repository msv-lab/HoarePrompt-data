You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on t and n . You can make hacks only if both
versions of the problem are solved.

For a binary^\dagger pattern p and a binary string q , both of length m , q is
called p -good if for every i (1 \leq i \leq m ), there exist indices l and r
such that:

  * 1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq m , and 
  * p_i is a mode^\ddagger of the string q_l q_{l+1} \ldots q_{r} . 

For a pattern p , let f(p) be the minimum possible number of \mathtt{1} s in a
p -good binary string (of the same length as the pattern).

You are given a binary string s of size n . Find

In other words, you need to sum the values of f over all \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
substrings of s .

^\dagger A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters
\mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

^\ddagger Character c is a mode of string t of length m if the number of
occurrences of c in t is at least \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil . For example,
\mathtt{0} is a mode of \mathtt{010} , \mathtt{1} is not a mode of
\mathtt{010} , and both \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} are modes of \mathtt{011010}
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the binary string s .

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n
consisting of only characters \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 10^4
.

Output

For each test case, output the sum of values of f over all substrings of s .

Output

    1
    2
    0
    346
    
Note

In the first test case, the only \mathtt{1} -good string is \mathtt{1} . Thus,
f(\mathtt{1})=1 .

In the second test case, f(\mathtt{10})=1 because \mathtt{01} is \mathtt{10}
-good, and \mathtt{00} is not \mathtt{10} -good. Thus, the answer is
f(\mathtt{1})+f(\mathtt{10})+f(\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 .

In the third test case, f equals to 0 for all 1 \leq i \leq j \leq 5 . Thus,
the answer is 0 .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1'. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 10⁴.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    num_cases = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        result = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == '1':
                dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]
            else:
                dp[i] = dp[i + 1]
        
        result = sum(dp[:n])
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `index` is `num_cases + 1`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for each case, `data` is a list of strings, `s` is the last string processed, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the presence of '1's in the string `s` from index `-1` to `n-1`, `n` is the number of cases processed, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for the last case.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `results` is a non-empty list, `index` is `num_cases + 1`, `data` is a list of strings, `s` is the last string processed, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the presence of '1's in the string `s` from index `-1` to `n-1`, `n` is the number of cases processed, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for the last case, `res` contains the value of each element in the `results` list, the loop prints each element in `results`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
