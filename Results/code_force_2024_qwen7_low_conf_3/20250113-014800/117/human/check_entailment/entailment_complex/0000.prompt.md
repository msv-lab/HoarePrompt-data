You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'B' indicates a black cell and 'W' indicates a white cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in s is black.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the final integer value entered by the user across all iterations, `b` is the final user's input across all iterations, `c` is the reversed version of `b`. If the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1, the final output of the print statement is `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. Otherwise, the final value of `a` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer \(a\) and a string \(b\) of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10\)) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, the function reverses the string \(b\) and counts the occurrences of 'B'. If the count of 'B' is greater than 1, the function calculates and prints \(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')\), where \(c\) is the reversed version of \(b\). If the count of 'B' is not greater than 1, the function simply prints \(a\). The function does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates on variables derived from user input. After the function concludes, it outputs a series of values based on the conditions described above. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the string \(b\) contains only one 'B' or no 'B' at all, which would result in the original value of \(a\) being printed.
