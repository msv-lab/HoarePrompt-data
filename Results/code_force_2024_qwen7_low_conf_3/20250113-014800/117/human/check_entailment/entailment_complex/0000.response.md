Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells to paint white so that all cells in the strip become white. Given that at least one cell is black, the optimal solution is to cover all black cells with a single operation. Therefore, the answer should be the position of the last black cell plus one if there is more than one black cell, or just the position of the last black cell if there is exactly one black cell.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the cells.
   - It reverses the string `b` to get `c`.
   - It checks if there are more than one black cell (`'B'`) in the reversed string `c`.
     - If there are more than one black cells, it calculates the answer as `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`, which essentially calculates the distance between the last black cell in the reversed string and the last black cell in the original string.
     - If there is only one black cell, it prints `a`, which is the length of the strip.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string has only one black cell, the logic correctly identifies that painting the segment starting from that cell up to the end of the strip is the solution.
   - If the string has more than one black cell, the logic also correctly identifies the optimal segment to paint by considering both the first and last black cells in the original and reversed strings.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function correctly identifies the minimum length of the segment to paint white to make all cells white.
   - The approach taken handles all possible test cases as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
