You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = input()
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer \(a\) and a string \(b\) of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10\)) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, the function reverses the string \(b\) and counts the occurrences of 'B'. If the count of 'B' is greater than 1, the function calculates and prints \(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')\), where \(c\) is the reversed version of \(b\). If the count of 'B' is not greater than 1, the function simply prints \(a\). The function does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates on variables derived from user input. After the function concludes, it outputs a series of values based on the conditions described above. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the string \(b\) contains only one 'B' or no 'B' at all, which would result in the original value of \(a\) being printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The program attempts to reverse the input string `b` and find the index of the last occurrence of 'B', but this does not account for all possible scenarios.
3. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the black cells ('B') are not at the start or end of the string. It also does not consider the minimum segment needed when multiple segments of black cells are present.
4. The logic for handling the case with more than one 'B' is flawed. It simply calculates the distance between the first and last 'B' without ensuring that the segment includes all black cells.
5. The program incorrectly assumes that the entire strip needs to be painted white if there's only one 'B' in the middle of the string, which is not always true.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
