You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = input()
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'B' indicates a black cell and 'W' indicates a white cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in s is black.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the final integer value entered by the user across all iterations, `b` is the final user's input across all iterations, `c` is the reversed version of `b`. If the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1, the final output of the print statement is `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. Otherwise, the final value of `a` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Consider the input:

```
6
WBBWBW
```

The expected output is `4`, but the program outputs `2` because it incorrectly uses the reverse of the string and checks for the first occurrence of 'B' from both ends. This approach fails to find the minimum length segment that needs to be painted white. For instance, in the string "WBBWBW", painting from the 2nd to the 5th cell (length 4) is the correct solution, but the program incorrectly identifies the segment from the last 'B' to the first 'B', which would be shorter than necessary in this case.
