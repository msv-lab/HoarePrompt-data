Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Consider the input:

```
6
WBBWBW
```

The expected output is `4`, but the program outputs `2` because it incorrectly uses the reverse of the string and checks for the first occurrence of 'B' from both ends. This approach fails to find the minimum length segment that needs to be painted white. For instance, in the string "WBBWBW", painting from the 2nd to the 5th cell (length 4) is the correct solution, but the program incorrectly identifies the segment from the last 'B' to the first 'B', which would be shorter than necessary in this case.
