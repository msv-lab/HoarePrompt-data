The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but processes data through variables `t`, `n`, and `s`. The variable `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, the variable `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), and the variable `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'B' indicates a black cell and 'W' indicates a white cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in `s` is black.

The function may return different outputs based on the processing of these variables, but the exact return value is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes variables `t`, `n`, and `s` where `t` is a positive integer (\(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), `n` is a positive integer (\(1 \leq n \leq 10\)), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a value based on the processing of these variables.**
