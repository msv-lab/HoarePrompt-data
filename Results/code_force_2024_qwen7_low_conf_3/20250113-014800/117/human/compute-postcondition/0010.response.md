`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `a` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the integer value entered by the user, `b` is the user input, `c` is the reverse of `b`, and there must be at least one iteration left.**
