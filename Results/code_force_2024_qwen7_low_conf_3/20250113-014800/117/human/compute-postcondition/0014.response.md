The code `print(a)` simply prints the value of `a` without changing any variables. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `a` is printed, but its value is not altered by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the integer value entered by the user, `b` is the user's input, `c` is the reversed version of `b`, and the value of `a` is printed.**
