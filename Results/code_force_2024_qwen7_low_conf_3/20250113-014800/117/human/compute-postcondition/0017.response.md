`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the integer value entered by the user, `b` is the user's input, `c` is the reversed version of `b`.
