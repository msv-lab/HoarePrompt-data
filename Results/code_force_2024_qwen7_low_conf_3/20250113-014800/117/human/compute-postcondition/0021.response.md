The code `print(a)` simply prints the value of the variable `a`. This does not change the value of any variable but outputs `a` to the console. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the integer value entered by the user, `b` is the user's input, `c` is the reversed version of `b`, and the value of `a` is printed to the console.**
