State before the loop starts: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'B' indicates a black cell and 'W' indicates a white cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in `s` is black.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute once for each line of input received from the standard input (stdin).
2. To execute this loop, the program must receive at least one line of input. Therefore, we need to ensure that there is at least one input available.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is the number of test cases, and since `t` is between 1 and 10^4, there must be at least one test case.
- For each test case, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `s` must be a string of length `n` containing only 'W' and 'B'.
- It is guaranteed that `s` contains at least one black cell ('B').

To ensure the loop can execute:
- There must be at least one line of input. Since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, we know that there will be at least one test case.
- Each test case requires `n` and `s` to be defined and valid according to the constraints.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- There must be at least one line of input.
- The value of `t` should be set to at least 1, ensuring there is at least one test case.
- For each test case, `n` must be an integer within the range [1, 10].
- The string `s` must be of length `n` and contain at least one 'B'.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B'**
