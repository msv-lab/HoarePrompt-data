Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the integer value entered by the user, `b` is the user's input, `c` is the reversed version of `b`. If the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1, the program prints `a - n + 1`. Otherwise, the program prints `a`.**
