Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the integer value entered by the user, `b` is the user's input, `c` is the reversed version of `b`. If the reversed string `c` contains more than one 'B', the value of the print statement is `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. Otherwise, the value of `a` is printed.***
