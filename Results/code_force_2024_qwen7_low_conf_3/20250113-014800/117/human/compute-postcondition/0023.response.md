Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer in the range [1, 10], `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B' and at least one 'B', `a` is the final integer value entered by the user across all iterations, `b` is the final user's input across all iterations, `c` is the reversed version of `b`. If the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1, the final output of the print statement is `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. Otherwise, the final value of `a` is printed.**
