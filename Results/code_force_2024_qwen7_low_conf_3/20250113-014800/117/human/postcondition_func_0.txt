The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer \(a\) and a string \(b\) of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10\)) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, the function reverses the string \(b\) and counts the occurrences of 'B'. If the count of 'B' is greater than 1, the function calculates and prints \(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')\), where \(c\) is the reversed version of \(b\). If the count of 'B' is not greater than 1, the function simply prints \(a\). The function does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates on variables derived from user input. After the function concludes, it outputs a series of values based on the conditions described above. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the string \(b\) contains only one 'B' or no 'B' at all, which would result in the original value of \(a\) being printed.
