The function `func_2` takes no parameters directly but expects input through standard input. It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, calls the function `func_1(n, x)`, and appends the result to the list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in the `results` list. If `t` is zero, the function will not enter the loop and simply print nothing. If `t` is negative, the function will raise a `ValueError` because `int(input())` will fail.
