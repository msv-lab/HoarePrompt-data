Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly initializes the count and starts iterating over possible values of `k` from 2 upwards.
   - For each value of `k`, it calculates the cycle length (`cycle_length = 2 * k - 2`) and the position within the current cycle (`position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1`).
   - It then determines the `expected_number` based on whether the position is within the first `k` elements of the cycle or not.
   - The function correctly increments the count whenever `expected_number` matches `x`.
   - The loop continues until `2 * k - 2` exceeds `n`, ensuring that all relevant values of `k` are considered.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate `n` and `x` values and stores the results.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
   - The function handles multiple test cases efficiently by using a loop and correctly managing the indices.

Given the detailed descriptions of the states before and after each function call, and the logical steps taken within each function, both functions together correctly solve the problem as described.

Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
