You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle
        else:
            expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle
        if expected_number == x:
            count += 1
        k += 1
    return count

- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle
        else:
            expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle
        
        if expected_number == x:
            count += 1
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the initial value, `k` is the smallest integer greater than \(\frac{n + 2}{2}\), `count` is the number of times `expected_number == x` was true during the loop iterations, `x` is the initial value.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of times expected_number == x was true during the loop iterations, given that `expected_number` is calculated as the smallest integer greater than (n + 2) / 2 and `x` is the initial value of n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `x`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). It calculates the number of times the `expected_number` equals `x` during the loop iterations. The `expected_number` is determined as the smallest integer greater than \(\frac{n + 2}{2}\). The function iterates through values of `k` starting from 2, calculating the cycle length and position within the cycle, and then determining `expected_number` based on these calculations. If `expected_number` equals `x`, it increments the `count`. After the loop, the function returns `count`, which represents the number of times `expected_number` equaled `x` during the iterations. Potential edge cases include when `n` is very small (e.g., close to 1), but the function handles these correctly as the loop condition ensures `2 * k - 2 <= n`. No missing functionality is noted in the provided code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, n and x are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        results.append(func_1(n, x))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - t]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - t + 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `index + t * 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains the values returned by `func_1(data[index - t], data[index - t + 1])` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, x)` in the final iteration of the loop, and the value of `result` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers \( n \) and \( x \). For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, x)` and appends the result to a list called `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include the input not conforming to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values), and the maximum value constraints for \( n \) and \( x \). If the input does not follow the expected format, the function may raise a `ValueError`. The function assumes that the input will always be valid and within the specified constraints.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the correctness of the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \( k \) starting from 2 until \( 2k - 2 \) exceeds \( n \).
   - For each \( k \), it calculates the length of the cycle, which is \( 2k - 2 \).
   - It then determines the position within the current cycle using \((n-1) \% (2k-2) + 1\).
   - Depending on whether this position is within the first \( k \) positions or not, it calculates the expected number \( x \) that should be at position \( n \).
   - If the expected number matches the actual \( x \) given in the input, it increments the count.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses a more efficient way to read input by reading all input at once and splitting it into individual test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:

#### Input/Output Consistency:
- The input format and constraints are correctly handled.
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.
- The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases correctly and outputs the results as required.

#### Logic Accuracy:
- The calculation of the position within the cycle and the determination of the expected number match the problem description.
- The loop condition in `func_1` ensures that all possible values of \( k \) are checked until \( 2k - 2 \) exceeds \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program accurately solves the problem as described. The functions correctly handle the logic and constraints specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
