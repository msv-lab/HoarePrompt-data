Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to solve the main part of the problem. It iterates over possible values of \( k \) starting from 2 and checks whether the number assigned to Vasya's position matches the one he remembers. The function correctly handles the calculation of the cycle length and the position within the cycle. The logic for determining the `expected_number` is sound and aligns with the problem description. The function also correctly increments the count whenever the `expected_number` matches the remembered number `x`.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is responsible for reading multiple test cases from standard input and processing them using `func_1`. It reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate arguments, and then prints the results. The function handles the input reading and splitting correctly and calls `func_1` for each test case. It also handles the output printing correctly.

Given the descriptions and execution summaries of the functions, both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic in `func_1` is accurate, and `func_2` correctly uses `func_1` to process multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
