### Reasoning

Let's analyze the code and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description
The problem requires us to determine the number of valid \( k \) values given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling process. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and we need to check if the number at position \( n \) matches \( x \) for different values of \( k \).

#### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \( k \) starting from 2.
   - It calculates the length of one cycle (`cycle_length = 2 * k - 2`).
   - It computes the position within the current cycle (`position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1`).
   - Depending on the position within the cycle, it determines the expected number.
     - If the position is within the first \( k \) positions, the expected number is the same as the position.
     - Otherwise, the expected number is calculated as `2 * k - position_in_cycle`.
   - It checks if the expected number matches \( x \) and increments the count if it does.
   - The loop continues until the cycle length exceeds \( n \).

2. **Function `func_2`**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which includes the number of test cases \( t \) and the pairs \( (n, x) \) for each test case.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, x)` and appending the result to a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list.

#### Function Summary
- The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
- It handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

#### Correctness Evaluation

1. **Cycle Length Calculation**
   - The calculation of the cycle length `2 * k - 2` is correct and ensures that the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Position Calculation**
   - The calculation of the position within the current cycle `(n - 1) % cycle_length + 1` is correct.

3. **Expected Number Calculation**
   - The logic for calculating the expected number is correct:
     - For positions within the first \( k \) positions, the expected number is the same as the position.
     - For positions beyond the first \( k \) positions, the expected number is `2 * k - position_in_cycle`.

4. **Loop Termination**
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly terminates when the cycle length exceeds \( n \).

5. **Input Handling**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic for determining the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that the code fails to handle.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the logic for determining the number of valid \( k \) values given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling process.
