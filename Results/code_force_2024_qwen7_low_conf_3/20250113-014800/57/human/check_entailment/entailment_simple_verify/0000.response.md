### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the required logic.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Cycle Length Calculation**:
   ```python
   cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
   ```
   This calculates the length of the cycle for the current \( k \).

2. **Position in Cycle**:
   ```python
   position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
   ```
   This computes the position of \( n \) within the current cycle.

3. **Expected Number Calculation**:
   ```python
   if position_in_cycle <= k:
       expected_number = position_in_cycle
   else:
       expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle
   ```
   This determines the number assigned to position \( n \) based on the cycle pattern.

4. **Check and Count**:
   ```python
   if expected_number == x:
       count += 1
   ```
   If the expected number matches \( x \), increment the count.

5. **Loop Increment**:
   ```python
   k += 1
   ```
   Increment \( k \) and repeat the process until the condition \( 2 * k - 2 <= n \) is no longer satisfied.

The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of valid \( k \) values for a given \( n \) and \( x \).

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   input = sys.stdin.read
   data = input().split()
   t = int(data[0])
   index = 1
   results = []
   ```
   This reads all input into a single string, splits it, and extracts the number of test cases \( t \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(data[index])
       x = int(data[index + 1])
       index += 2
       results.append(func_1(n, x))
   ```
   For each test case, it extracts \( n \) and \( x \), calls `func_1`, and appends the result to `results`.

3. **Printing Results**:
   ```python
   for result in results:
       print(result)
   ```
   Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic in `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

#### Correctness Validation with Annotated Code:
- The annotations match the behavior described in the code.
- The state transitions are consistent with the logical flow of the program.
- The program correctly handles all test cases as per the given examples.

Given the detailed analysis and the matching of the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate.
