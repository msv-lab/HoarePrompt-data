### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the correctness of the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \( k \) starting from 2 until \( 2k - 2 \) exceeds \( n \).
   - For each \( k \), it calculates the length of the cycle, which is \( 2k - 2 \).
   - It then determines the position within the current cycle using \((n-1) \% (2k-2) + 1\).
   - Depending on whether this position is within the first \( k \) positions or not, it calculates the expected number \( x \) that should be at position \( n \).
   - If the expected number matches the actual \( x \) given in the input, it increments the count.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses a more efficient way to read input by reading all input at once and splitting it into individual test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:

#### Input/Output Consistency:
- The input format and constraints are correctly handled.
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.
- The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases correctly and outputs the results as required.

#### Logic Accuracy:
- The calculation of the position within the cycle and the determination of the expected number match the problem description.
- The loop condition in `func_1` ensures that all possible values of \( k \) are checked until \( 2k - 2 \) exceeds \( n \).

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_1` that affects its correctness:

- The logic to calculate the expected number \( x \) is flawed. Specifically, the line:
  ```python
  if position_in_cycle <= k:
      expected_number = position_in_cycle
  else:
      expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle
  ```
  This logic assumes that the position within the cycle is directly mapped to the expected number without accounting for the repeating pattern correctly. This will lead to incorrect results for many cases.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- For \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \):
  - When \( k = 2 \): The expected numbers are 1, 2, 1, 2, ...
  - When \( k = 3 \): The expected numbers are 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, ...
  - When \( k = 5 \): The expected numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, ...

The function does not correctly map the position within the cycle to the expected number, leading to incorrect counts.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not accurately solve the problem as described due to the flawed logic in calculating the expected number \( x \).

### Correctness:
**False**

Thus, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
