Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Number:**
   - The problem description states that the settling pattern repeats every \(2k-2\) positions. The settling pattern within one cycle is:
     - First \(k\) positions: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\)
     - Next \(k-2\) positions: \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\)
     - Repeat the first \(k\) positions again: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\)
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates the expected number as the smallest integer greater than \(\frac{n+2}{2}\). This approach does not accurately reflect the settling pattern.

2. **Cycle Length Calculation:**
   - The cycle length is correctly calculated as \(2k-2\).
   - The position within the cycle is correctly calculated using \((n-1) \% (2k-2) + 1\).
   - However, the expected number calculation is flawed. The program should check both the first half and the second half of the cycle separately.

3. **Expected Number Calculation:**
   - For positions within the first \(k\) part of the cycle, the expected number is simply the position.
   - For positions within the next \(k-2\) part of the cycle, the expected number is \(2k - \text{position}\).

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the settling pattern, the program should:
1. Calculate the position within the cycle.
2. Determine which part of the cycle the position falls into.
3. Calculate the expected number based on the part of the cycle.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle
        else:
            expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle
        
        if expected_number == x:
            count += 1
        
        k += 1
        
    return count
```

This implementation correctly follows the settling pattern described in the problem statement. It checks both parts of the cycle (first \(k\) and the next \(k-2\)) and ensures the expected number matches the given number \(x\).

Given the above explanation, the original program does not correctly implement the settling pattern as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
