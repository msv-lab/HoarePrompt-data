Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the number of valid \( k \) values given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function iterates through possible values of \( k \) starting from 2 and checks if the number assigned to Vasya's position \( n \) matches the expected value based on the settling pattern. It correctly calculates the expected number at position \( n \) for each \( k \) and increments the count if the number matches \( x \).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input and processes each test case using `func_1`. It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the implementation seems robust and covers all necessary conditions. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that the code fails to handle. Therefore, the code is correct for the given problem statement.
