### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the correctness of the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \( k \) starting from 2 until \( 2k - 2 \) exceeds \( n \).
   - For each \( k \), it calculates the length of the cycle, which is \( 2k - 2 \).
   - It then determines the position within the current cycle using \((n-1) \% (2k-2) + 1\).
   - Depending on whether this position is within the first \( k \) positions or not, it calculates the expected number \( x \) that should be at position \( n \).
   - If the expected number matches the actual \( x \) given in the input, it increments the count.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses a more efficient way to read input by reading all input at once and splitting it into individual test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:

#### Input/Output Consistency:
- The input format and constraints are correctly handled.
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.
- The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases correctly and outputs the results as required.

#### Logic Accuracy:
- The calculation of the position within the cycle and the determination of the expected number match the problem description.
- The loop condition in `func_1` ensures that all possible values of \( k \) are checked until \( 2k - 2 \) exceeds \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program accurately solves the problem as described. The functions correctly handle the logic and constraints specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
