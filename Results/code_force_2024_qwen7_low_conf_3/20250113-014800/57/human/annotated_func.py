#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the initial value, `k` is the smallest integer greater than \(\frac{n + 2}{2}\), `count` is the number of times `expected_number == x` was true during the loop iterations, `x` is the initial value.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of times expected_number == x was true during the loop iterations, given that `expected_number` is calculated as the smallest integer greater than (n + 2) / 2 and `x` is the initial value of n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `x`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). It calculates the number of times the `expected_number` equals `x` during the loop iterations. The `expected_number` is determined as the smallest integer greater than \(\frac{n + 2}{2}\). The function iterates through values of `k` starting from 2, calculating the cycle length and position within the cycle, and then determining `expected_number` based on these calculations. If `expected_number` equals `x`, it increments the `count`. After the loop, the function returns `count`, which represents the number of times `expected_number` equaled `x` during the iterations. Potential edge cases include when `n` is very small (e.g., close to 1), but the function handles these correctly as the loop condition ensures `2 * k - 2 <= n`. No missing functionality is noted in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, n and x are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        results.append(func_1(n, x))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - t]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - t + 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `index + t * 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains the values returned by `func_1(data[index - t], data[index - t + 1])` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, x)` in the final iteration of the loop, and the value of `result` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers \( n \) and \( x \). For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, x)` and appends the result to a list called `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include the input not conforming to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values), and the maximum value constraints for \( n \) and \( x \). If the input does not follow the expected format, the function may raise a `ValueError`. The function assumes that the input will always be valid and within the specified constraints.
