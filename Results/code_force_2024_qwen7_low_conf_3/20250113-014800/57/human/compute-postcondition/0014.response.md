The code appends the result of `func_1(n, x)` to the `results` list. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n` and `x`, but only that `n` is the integer value of `data[3]` and `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, we know that `results` now contains one more element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, x)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents**
