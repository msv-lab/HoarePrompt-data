The code snippet updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. Given the initial state, `index` is 3, so `n` will be updated to the integer value of `data[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)`**
