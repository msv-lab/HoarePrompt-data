Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `x`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). It calculates the number of times the `expected_number` equals `x` during the loop iterations. The `expected_number` is determined as the smallest integer greater than \(\frac{n + 2}{2}\). The function iterates through values of `k` starting from 2, calculating the cycle length and position within the cycle, and then determining `expected_number` based on these calculations. If `expected_number` equals `x`, it increments the `count`. After the loop, the function returns `count`, which represents the number of times `expected_number` equaled `x` during the iterations. Potential edge cases include when `n` is very small (e.g., close to 1), but the function handles these correctly as the loop condition ensures `2 * k - 2 <= n`. No missing functionality is noted in the provided code.**
