The code `print(result)` simply prints the value of the variable `result`. Since no assignment or modification is performed on `result`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the only impact is that the value of `result` is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains at least two elements returned by `func_1(n, x)`, and the value of `result` is printed.**
