The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, x)` to the `results` list. Since the function `func_1` is called with `n` and `x` as arguments, the value of `results` changes. The initial state of `results` is the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.

Given:
- `n` is `int(data[5])`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[6]`

After the code runs, `results` will contain the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[5])`, `x` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 7, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.**
