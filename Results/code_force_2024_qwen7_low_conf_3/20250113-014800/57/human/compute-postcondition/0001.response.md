The code reads a line of input using `input()` and splits it into a list of strings using `.split()`. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, but the `data` variable now holds the split input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**.
