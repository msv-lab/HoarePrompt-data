The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given that `index` was initially 5, after executing this line, `index` will be 7. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `data`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[5])`, `x` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 7, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.**
