According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- `index` is 5
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since we do not know the exact value of `t` at the start of the loop, we only need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0 (to allow the loop to continue)
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3]` (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `x` is the integer value of `data[4]` (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `index` is 5 (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents (unchanged from the previous iteration)

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents**
