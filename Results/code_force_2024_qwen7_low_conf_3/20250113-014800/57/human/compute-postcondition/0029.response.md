Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers \( n \) and \( x \). For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, x)` and appends the result to a list called `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include the input not conforming to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values), and the maximum value constraints for \( n \) and \( x \). If the input does not follow the expected format, the function may raise a `ValueError`. The function assumes that the input will always be valid and within the specified constraints.**
