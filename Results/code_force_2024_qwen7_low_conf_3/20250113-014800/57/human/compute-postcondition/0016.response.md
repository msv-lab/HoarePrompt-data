`n` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index])`. Given that `index` is 5, `n` is now `int(data[5])`. The value of `t`, `x`, `data`, `index`, and `results` remains unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[5])`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.
