`results` is a list that appends the return value of `func_1(n, x)`. The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `x` as arguments. The values of `n` and `x` are derived from `data[1]` and `data[2]` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The `index` variable is also not affected. Therefore, after executing the line of code, `results` will contain the return value of `func_1(n, x)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)`, `t` must be greater than 0**
