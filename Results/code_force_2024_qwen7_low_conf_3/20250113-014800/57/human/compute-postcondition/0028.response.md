The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the parameter list `def func_2():`. The constraints and relationships provided are related to the inputs of the function, but since they are not part of the function's signature, they are not directly relevant to the description of what the function accepts and returns.

Given the provided output cases, it seems the function might internally process some inputs (not specified in the function definition) and return a result based on certain conditions. However, based solely on the function definition provided, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given code snippet.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value.**
