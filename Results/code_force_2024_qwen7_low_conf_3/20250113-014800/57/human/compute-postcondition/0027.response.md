Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains the values returned by `func_1(data[index - t], data[index - t + 1])` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, x)` in the final iteration of the loop, and the value of `result` is printed.**
