The value of `index` is incremented by 2. Initially, `index` is 1, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0.
