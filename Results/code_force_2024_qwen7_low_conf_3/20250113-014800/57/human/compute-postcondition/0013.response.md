The value of `index` is incremented by 2, changing its value from the initial state. The initial value of `index` was 3, so after incrementing by 2, `index` becomes 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)`**
