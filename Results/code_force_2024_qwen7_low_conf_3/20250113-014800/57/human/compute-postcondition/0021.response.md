To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions specified in the for loop statement and the given initial states.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

2. **Initial States Provided**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index - t]`.
   - `x` is the integer value of `data[index - t + 1]`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `index` is `index + t * 2`.
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.

3. **Ensuring `results` is Non-empty**:
   - To ensure that `results` contains at least one element, `func_1(n, x)` must return a non-null value at least once.

4. **Dependencies of `n` and `x`**:
   - `n` is derived from `data[index - t]`, and `x` is derived from `data[index - t + 1]`.
   - Therefore, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` must be valid indices within the `data` list, and these elements must be convertible to integers.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - Ensure `t` is greater than 0 (already stated).
   - Ensure `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list.
   - Ensure `func_1(n, x)` returns a non-null value at least once to populate `results`.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains at least one element returned by `func_1(n, x)`, where `n = data[index - t]` and `x = data[index - t + 1]`**.
