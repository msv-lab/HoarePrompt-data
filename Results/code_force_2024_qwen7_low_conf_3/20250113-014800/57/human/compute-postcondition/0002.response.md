`t` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, which is an integer. The value of `n` and `x` remains unchanged, and the list `data` remains unchanged except for the first element. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data`, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data`, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
