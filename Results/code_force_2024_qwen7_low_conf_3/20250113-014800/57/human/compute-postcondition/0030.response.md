Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than `2 * k - 2`, `cycle_length` is `2 * k - 2`, `position_in_cycle` is `(n - 1) \% (2 * k - 2) + 1`, `expected_number` is either equal to `position_in_cycle` if `position_in_cycle <= k`, or `2 * k - position_in_cycle` otherwise; `count` is increased by 1 if `expected_number == x`.***
