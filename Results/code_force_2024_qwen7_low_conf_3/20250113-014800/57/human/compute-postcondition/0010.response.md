According to the code, the loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the first element of the `data` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `index` is 3.
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, as the loop runs `t` times. Since the loop runs based on the initial value of `t`, we don't need to adjust `t` itself but rather ensure that it remains positive. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) are not directly involved in the loop's condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)`**
