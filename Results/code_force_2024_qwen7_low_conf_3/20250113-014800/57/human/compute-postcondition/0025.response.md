According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each element in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains at least two elements returned by `func_1(n, x)`, where `n = data[index - t]` and `x = data[index - t + 1]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, x)`, and the value of `result` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least two elements left in `results` after the current element has been processed. Since one element has already been processed (the current `result`), there must be at least one more element remaining in `results`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list.
   - `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers.
   - `results` contains at least two elements returned by `func_1(n, x)`.
   - `n = data[index - t]`.
   - `x = data[index - t + 1]`.
   - `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, x)`, and the value of `result` is printed.

2. **After One Iteration**:
   - One element from `results` has been processed, so `results` must still contain at least one more element.
   - `result` has been set to the first element in `results`.

3. **For the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one more element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` contains at least one more element.

**State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains at least two elements returned by `func_1(n, x)` (one of which has already been processed), and `result` is the value of the element that was just processed.**
