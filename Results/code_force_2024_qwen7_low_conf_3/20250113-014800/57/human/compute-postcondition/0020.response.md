Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - t]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - t + 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `index + t * 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- **`n` and `x`**: These variables are set to the integer values of `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` respectively, where `t` is the number of iterations that have occurred. After each iteration, `t` decrements by 1.
- **`data`**: This list remains unchanged throughout the execution.
- **`index`**: This variable is incremented by `2 * t` (or simply `2 * k` for the k-th iteration), where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, after `t` iterations, `index` will be `index + t * 2`.
- **`results`**: This list accumulates the return values of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration.

Since the loop continues until `t` reaches 0, the final state of the loop will be when `t` is 0. At this point:
- `t` is 0.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` (since `index` would be the last valid index in `data` when `t` becomes 0).
- `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (since `index + 1` would be the next valid index in `data` when `t` becomes 0).
- `index` is `index + t * 2`, which simplifies to `index` itself.
- `results` contains all the accumulated return values of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration.

Thus, the final output state is as described above.
