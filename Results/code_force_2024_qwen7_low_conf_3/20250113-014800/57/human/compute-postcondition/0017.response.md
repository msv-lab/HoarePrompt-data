The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `x`. Given that `index` is 5, `index + 1` is 6. Therefore, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[6]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[5])`, `x` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n, x)` appended to its previous contents.**
