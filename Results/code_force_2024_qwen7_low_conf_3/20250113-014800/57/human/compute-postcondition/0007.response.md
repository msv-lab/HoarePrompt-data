The code `x = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**
