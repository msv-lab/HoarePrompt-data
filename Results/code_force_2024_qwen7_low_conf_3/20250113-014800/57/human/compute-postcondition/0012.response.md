The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `x`. Given the initial state, `index` is 3, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[4]`. Since `data` is a list of strings, `data[4]` is a string that needs to be converted to an integer using `int()`. 

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- `index` is 3
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)`

After the code execution, the value of `x` is updated to the integer value of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, x)`**
