According to the code, the loop depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0,
- `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list,
- `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers,
- `results` contains at least one element returned by `func_1(n, x)`, where `n = data[index - t]` and `x = data[index - t + 1]`,
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, x)`,
- and the value of `result` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element. Since the loop body is omit, we assume it processes each `result` in `results` and removes it from `results` after processing.

Therefore, after processing the current `result`, `results` will contain at least one less element. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains at least two elements returned by `func_1(n, x)`, where `n = data[index - t]` and `x = data[index - t + 1]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, x)`, and the value of `result` is printed.**
