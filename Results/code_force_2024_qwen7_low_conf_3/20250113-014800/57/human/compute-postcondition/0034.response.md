The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `x`. Both `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. The function returns `count`, which is the number of times `expected_number == x` was true during the loop iterations. Here, `expected_number` is calculated as the smallest integer greater than (n + 2) / 2, and `x` is the initial value of `n`.
