The code `print(result)` prints the value of the variable `result`. Since `result` was previously defined as being returned by `func_1(n, x)`, where `n = data[index - t]` and `x = data[index - t + 1]`, the value of `result` remains unchanged. The print statement does not alter the values of the variables but simply outputs the value of `result`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `index - t` and `index - t + 1` are valid indices for the `data` list, `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` are convertible to integers, `results` contains at least one element returned by `func_1(n, x)`, where `n = data[index - t]` and `x = data[index - t + 1]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, x)`, and the value of `result` is printed.**
