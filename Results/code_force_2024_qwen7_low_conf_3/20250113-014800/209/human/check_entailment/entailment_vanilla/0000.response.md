Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.

The key insight here is to realize that the maximum GCD value is determined by the smallest factor of `x` that can evenly divide `x` into `n` parts. If `i` is a divisor of `x`, then we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems where each sub-problem has a difficulty of `i`. The GCD of these sub-problems would be `i`.

- We iterate through potential divisors from `1` to `âˆšx` because any larger divisor would have already been checked as a corresponding smaller divisor.
- For each divisor `i` of `x`, we check if it can be used as the difficulty of at least one sub-problem. This means either `n <= x // i` (each sub-problem could have difficulty `i`) or `n <= i` (each sub-problem could have difficulty `x // i`).

The given solution correctly implements this logic. It iterates over potential divisors and keeps track of the maximum GCD found.

The output is correct because it considers all possible ways to split `x` into `n` parts and finds the largest possible GCD among those splits.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
