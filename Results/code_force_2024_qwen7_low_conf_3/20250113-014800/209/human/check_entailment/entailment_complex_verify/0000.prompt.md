You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is any integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is any integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `ans` is the maximum value among the values of `i` or `x // i` where `x % i == 0` and either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` for all tested values of `x` and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three values: `t`, `x`, and `n`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` where `x % i == 0` and either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`. It then prints this maximum value for each test case. The function accepts no explicit parameters; instead, it reads `t` from the first line of input, followed by `t` pairs of integers `(x, n)`. There are no return values, but the function prints the calculated maximum value for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `x` is a perfect square, where both `i` and `x // i` might be considered for the maximum value. The function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly; it assumes valid input within the specified ranges.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to be correctly implementing the logic to find the maximum balance for the given constraints. Here’s a brief reasoning:

1. **Prime Factorization Approach**: The program tries to find the maximum divisor of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems. This is effectively finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `n`.

2. **Loop through Divisors**: It iterates through all divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)` and checks if `n` can be divided by the divisor or the corresponding quotient (`x // i`). This ensures that the sum of difficulties remains `x`.

3. **Update Maximum Balance**: The variable `ans` keeps track of the maximum balance found, which is updated whenever a valid divisor is found.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. For example:
- For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the program correctly identifies that the maximum balance is `2` (divisors 2 and 5).
- For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the program correctly identifies that the maximum balance is `1` (each sub-problem has a difficulty of 1).
- For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the program correctly identifies that the maximum balance is `6` (divisors 6 and 70).

Since no edge cases or specific inputs can be found that would make the program fail, the program is deemed correct.
