You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is any integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is any integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `ans` is the maximum value among the values of `i` or `x // i` where `x % i == 0` and either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` for all tested values of `x` and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three values: `t`, `x`, and `n`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` where `x % i == 0` and either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`. It then prints this maximum value for each test case. The function accepts no explicit parameters; instead, it reads `t` from the first line of input, followed by `t` pairs of integers `(x, n)`. There are no return values, but the function prints the calculated maximum value for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `x` is a perfect square, where both `i` and `x // i` might be considered for the maximum value. The function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly; it assumes valid input within the specified ranges.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.

The key insight here is to realize that the maximum GCD value is determined by the smallest factor of `x` that can evenly divide `x` into `n` parts. If `i` is a divisor of `x`, then we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems where each sub-problem has a difficulty of `i`. The GCD of these sub-problems would be `i`.

- We iterate through potential divisors from `1` to `√x` because any larger divisor would have already been checked as a corresponding smaller divisor.
- For each divisor `i` of `x`, we check if it can be used as the difficulty of at least one sub-problem. This means either `n <= x // i` (each sub-problem could have difficulty `i`) or `n <= i` (each sub-problem could have difficulty `x // i`).

The given solution correctly implements this logic. It iterates over potential divisors and keeps track of the maximum GCD found.

The output is correct because it considers all possible ways to split `x` into `n` parts and finds the largest possible GCD among those splits.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
