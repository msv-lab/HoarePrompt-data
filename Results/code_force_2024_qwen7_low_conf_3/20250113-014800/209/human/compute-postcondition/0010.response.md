Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `ans` is the maximum between its previous value and `x // i`, provided that `i` satisfies the condition `n <= i`. If the condition `n <= i` does not hold, `ans` remains unchanged as 1.***
