Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer with \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `x // i`. This holds true regardless of whether the condition `n <= i` is satisfied or not, as there is no modification to `ans` in the absence of an else part.***
