Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` where `i` is \(k + 1\) and \(n \leq k + 1\). If `n <= i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Since there is no else part, the only case considered is when `n <= i`.***
