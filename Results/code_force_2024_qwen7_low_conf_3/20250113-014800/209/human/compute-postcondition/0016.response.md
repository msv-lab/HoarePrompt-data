Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `ans` is 2, and `i` is 3. If \(n \leq i\), then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.***
