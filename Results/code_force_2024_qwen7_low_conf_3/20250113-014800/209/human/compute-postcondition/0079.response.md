The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters, but it processes three implicit parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `x` and `n` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\).

The function returns different values based on the relationship between `x` and `n` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit parameters `t`, `x`, and `n`, and for each test case, if \(n \leq x\), it returns a specific value (the exact value depends on the problem's requirements, which are not specified here). If any of the conditions are not met, appropriate handling should be done based on the problem's constraints.**
