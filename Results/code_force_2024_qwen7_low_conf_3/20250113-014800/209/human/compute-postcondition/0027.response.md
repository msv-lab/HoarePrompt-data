The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. Since the initial values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` are known, the only changes are to `x` and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `x` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `ans` is 0

After the code executes, `x` and `n` will be updated to the values read from the input, while `t`, `ans`, and the range constraint of `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is input integer; `n` is input integer; `ans` is 0**
