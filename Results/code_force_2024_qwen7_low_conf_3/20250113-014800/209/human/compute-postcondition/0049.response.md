Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is the maximum value it has been updated to during the loop. The loop starts from `sqrt_x + 1` and increments `i` until it exceeds `x`. After the loop, `i` becomes `sqrt_x + 1` and `ans` is the maximum value it has been updated to. If `n <= i` holds true, then `ans` remains unchanged from the previous value; otherwise, the loop continues as described.***
