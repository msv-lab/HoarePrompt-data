The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates `ans` to be the maximum between its current value and `i`. We know from the initial state that:

- `ans` is 2 if \( n \leq i \); otherwise, `ans` is 1.
- `i` is \( i + 1 \).

Given these conditions, let's analyze the impact:

1. If \( n \leq i \), then `ans` was initially 2.
2. If \( n > i \), then `ans` was initially 1.

In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, so the new value of `i` is \( i + 1 \). Since `max(ans, i)` is being used, `ans` will take the value of `i + 1` if `i + 1` is greater than the current `ans`.

Let's consider both scenarios:

- If \( n \leq i \) and \( ans = 2 \):
  - If \( i + 1 > 2 \), then `ans` becomes \( i + 1 \).
  - If \( i + 1 \leq 2 \), then `ans` remains 2.

- If \( n > i \) and \( ans = 1 \):
  - If \( i + 1 > 1 \), then `ans` becomes \( i + 1 \).
  - If \( i + 1 \leq 1 \), this case is impossible since \( i \geq 1 \).

Since \( i \) is incremented by 1, and given that `i` starts at some value where it might be less than or equal to \( n \), the new `ans` will be `i + 1` in all feasible cases (as \( i + 1 \) will always be at least 2, making it the new maximum).

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `i` is now \( i + 1 \).
- `ans` is now \( i + 1 \).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `ans` is \( i + 1 \), `i` is \( i + 1 \)**
