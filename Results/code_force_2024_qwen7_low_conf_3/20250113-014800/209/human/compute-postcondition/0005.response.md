Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\) and \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `ans` is 1. There exists an integer `i` such that `x % i == 0`. Additionally, `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.**
