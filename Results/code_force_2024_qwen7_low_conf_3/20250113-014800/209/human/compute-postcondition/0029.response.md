According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` when taking its square root and converting it to an integer. The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `x` is an input integer
- `n` is an input integer
- `ans` is 1

For the loop to execute, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1. This means that `x` must be at least 1 because the smallest integer whose square root is at least 1 is 1 itself.

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `x` must be at least 1.
2. Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `x` must be a non-negative integer (which is already implied by `x` being an input integer).

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `x` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 1**
