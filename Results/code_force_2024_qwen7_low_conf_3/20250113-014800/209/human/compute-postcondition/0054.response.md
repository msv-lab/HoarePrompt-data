The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1 and now equals the first integer input, `n` is an input integer and now equals the second integer input, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is 1.**
