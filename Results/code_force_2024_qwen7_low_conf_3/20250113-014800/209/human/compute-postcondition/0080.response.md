Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three values: `t`, `x`, and `n`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` where `x % i == 0` and either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`. It then prints this maximum value for each test case. The function accepts no explicit parameters; instead, it reads `t` from the first line of input, followed by `t` pairs of integers `(x, n)`. There are no return values, but the function prints the calculated maximum value for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `x` is a perfect square, where both `i` and `x // i` might be considered for the maximum value. The function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly; it assumes valid input within the specified ranges.**
