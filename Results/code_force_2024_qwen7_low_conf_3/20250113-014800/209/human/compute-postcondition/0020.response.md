Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), if `n <= x // i`, then `ans` is \( i + 1 \); otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1.***
