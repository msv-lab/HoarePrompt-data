Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\) and \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `ans` is 1. The if condition `x % i == 0` is true for some integer `i`.***

Note: Since the variable `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the precondition, we infer that it is an integer that satisfies the condition `x % i == 0`. The postcondition includes the condition from the if statement, indicating that there exists an integer `i` such that `x % i == 0`.
