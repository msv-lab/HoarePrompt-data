The code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. However, the exact values of `ans` and `i` before this line are not specified in the initial state. The only known information from the initial state is that `i` starts from `n + 1` (since `n \leq k + 1` and `i = k + 1`). The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `sqrt_x + 1`.

Let's analyze the impact of the line `ans = max(ans, i)`:

- The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`.
- The value of `i` is incremented within the loop, so after each iteration, `i` increases by 1.

Since the exact starting value of `ans` and the values of `n` and `x` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans` without those details. However, we can express `ans` in terms of `i` and the initial value of `ans`.

Given the loop condition `sqrt_x + 1 <= x`, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `sqrt_x + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be in the range from `n + 1` to `sqrt_x + 1`.

The output state after the line `ans = max(ans, i)` will be:
- `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`.
- `i` is updated to `i + 1` at the end of the loop.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.**
