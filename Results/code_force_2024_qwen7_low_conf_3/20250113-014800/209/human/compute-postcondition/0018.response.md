Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- \( t \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^3 \).
- \( x \) is an integer within the range \( 1 \leq x \leq t \).
- \( n \) is an integer within the range \( 1 \leq n \leq t \).
- \( ans \) is 2 if \( n \leq i \); otherwise, \( ans \) is 1.
- \( i \) is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from \( i = 1 \) to \( i = \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor \).

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - \( t \) remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop directly.
   - \( x \) remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop directly.
   - \( n \) remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop directly.
   - \( ans \) is set to 2 if \( n \leq i \); otherwise, it is 1.
   - \( i \) is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) must be less than or equal to \( \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( i \) needs to be incremented by 1 to reach the next value in the range \( 1 \) to \( \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor \).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since \( i \) is incremented by 1, we need to increase \( i \) by 1.
   - \( ans \) will remain the same unless \( n \leq i \). However, since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly mention \( ans \) changing here.

### Final State:
- \( t \) remains unchanged.
- \( x \) remains unchanged.
- \( n \) remains unchanged.
- \( i \) is incremented by 1.
- \( ans \) remains the same unless \( n \leq i \), but for the next iteration, we assume it hasn't changed yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `ans` is 2 if \( n \leq i \); otherwise, `ans` is 1, `i` is \( i + 1 \)**.
