Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer with \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `ans` is equal to `max(ans, x // i)` where `x // i` is at least `n`. This holds true if and only if `n` is less than or equal to the quotient of `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
