Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer with \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `i`. This holds true whether the condition `n <= x // i` is satisfied or not since there is no else part that modifies `ans` outside this case.***
