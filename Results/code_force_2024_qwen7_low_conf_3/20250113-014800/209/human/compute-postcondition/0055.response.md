According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. Specifically, the loop will run if `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is at least 1. Given that `x` is an input integer and must be at least 1, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 1 to guarantee that the loop body can be executed.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. Since `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `int(1 ** 0.5) + 1` will be 2, ensuring the loop runs at least once.
4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `ans`) do not affect the condition for the loop to execute, so they remain as given.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `x` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is 1**
