The given code prints the value of `ans`. Since no changes are made to `ans` in the provided code snippet, the value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and the greatest divisor `d` of `x` where \(d \leq \sqrt{x}\) and `n \leq d`, or `x // d` where `n \leq x // d`. The value of `ans` is printed.**
