Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is the maximum of `max(1, i)` where \(x \% i == 0\) and \(n \leq i\). If no such `i` exists, `ans` remains 1.

2. **Understand the For Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to \(\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor + 1\).

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches \(\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor + 1\).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the value it reached just before the current iteration.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to \(\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor + 1\).

Given the previous iteration details:
- Let's say at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was \(k\), and `n` must satisfy the condition \(n \leq k\).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented to \(k + 1\).
   - `n` must still satisfy the condition \(n \leq k + 1\).

Therefore, the states to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be \(k + 1\).
- `n` must still satisfy the condition \(n \leq k + 1\).

Putting this into the required format:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is the maximum of `max(1, i)` where \(x \% i == 0\) and \(n \leq i\). If no such `i` exists, `ans` remains 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is \(k + 1\), and `n` must be such that \(n \leq k + 1\)**.

To be more precise, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`, then:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is the maximum of `max(1, i)` where \(x \% i == 0\) and \(n \leq i\). If no such `i` exists, `ans` remains 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is \(k + 1\), and `n` must be such that \(n \leq k + 1\)**.
