Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i` whenever `n <= x // i`. The variable `i` starts from `sqrt_x + 1` and is incremented until it exceeds `x`. After the loop, `i` becomes `sqrt_x + 1` and `ans` is the maximum value it has been updated to during the loop.***
