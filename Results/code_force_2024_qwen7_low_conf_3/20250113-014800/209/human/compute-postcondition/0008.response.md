Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\) and \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `ans` is `max(1, i_value)` where `i_value` is a divisor of `x` and the condition `n <= x // i_value` holds true. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition `n <= i`.**
