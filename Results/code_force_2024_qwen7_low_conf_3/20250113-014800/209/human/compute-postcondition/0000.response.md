State before the loop starts: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

Now, let's think through the for loop:

1. The loop runs `int(input())` times.
2. For each iteration, new values of `x` and `n` are read from input.
3. These values must satisfy \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\).

For the loop to execute, the number of iterations (`int(input())`) must be a valid value within the range defined by `t`.

So, we need to ensure that the input provided for `int(input())` is a valid number within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq t\).

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and the input for `int(input())` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq t\)**
