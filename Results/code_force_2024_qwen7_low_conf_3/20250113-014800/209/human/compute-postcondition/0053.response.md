The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. This means that the values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged, while `x` and `n` are updated to the new values entered by the user.

- The initial state had `t` as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` was an input integer that must be at least 1.
- `n` was an input integer.
- `k` (the number of iterations for the current loop instance) was also an input integer.

After executing the code, the values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the user's input, but the values of `t` and `k` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1 and now equals the first integer input, `n` is an input integer and now equals the second integer input, `k` is an input integer.**
