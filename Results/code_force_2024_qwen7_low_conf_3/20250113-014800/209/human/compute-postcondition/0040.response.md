Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is the maximum of `max(1, i)` where \(x \% i == 0\) and \(n \leq i\); at the start of the next iteration, `i` is \(k + 1\), and `n` must be such that \(n \leq k + 1\); `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`.**
