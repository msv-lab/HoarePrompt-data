Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `max(1, i)`, where \(x \% i == 0\) and `i` satisfies \(n \leq i\).***

Explanation: The postcondition includes all the details from the precondition and updates `ans` based on the if condition. Since the if condition is `if (n <= i):`, we ensure that `ans` remains `max(1, i)` under this condition. The updated value of `ans` is derived from the value of `i` that satisfies both the divisibility condition and the if condition.
