Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer with \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `ans` is the maximum of `x // n` and `x` if `x > ans` or `x // n` otherwise, provided that `n <= i`. If the condition `x % i == 0` is true and `n <= i`, then `ans` is updated accordingly.***
