The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `ans`. The initial value of `ans` was 0, but now it has been updated to 1. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `ans` is 1**
