Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` for each `i` where `n <= x // i`, the loop starts from `sqrt_x + 1` and increments `i` until it exceeds `x`, `i` becomes `sqrt_x + 1` after the loop, and `ans` is the maximum value it has been updated to during the loop.**
