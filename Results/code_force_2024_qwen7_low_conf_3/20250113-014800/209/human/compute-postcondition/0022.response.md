Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if `n <= x // i`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1.***
