Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `max(1, i)`, and there exists an integer `i` such that \(x \% i == 0\). If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` remains `max(1, i)`. There is no else part specified, so the value of `ans` does not change in any other case.***
