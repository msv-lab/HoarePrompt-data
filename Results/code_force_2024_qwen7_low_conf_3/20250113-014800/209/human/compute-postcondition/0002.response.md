The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, or `n`. The only change is that `ans` is now set to 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `ans` is 1.**
