The code reads two integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `x` and `n`. Since the input for `int(input())` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq t\), the values of `x` and `n` will be integers within this range. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), and `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq t\), and `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\)**.
