The code prints the string `str(i + 2) + ' ' + str(n)`. This means that `i` is incremented by 1 and then printed as `i + 2`, and `n` is also printed. However, the actual values of `i` and `n` are not provided in the initial state, only that `n` is greater than 0 and `1 \leq t \leq 10^4` which likely refers to the value of `t`.

Given this, the output string will be `i + 2` followed by the value of `n`. Since the exact values of `i` and `n` are not specified, we can't determine their exact numerical values, but we know the structure of the output.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`, and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, the condition `cur_mex == another_mex` is true; the console output contains the string '1 ' followed by the value of `i + 1`, and the console output is now 'i + 2' followed by the value of `n`.**
