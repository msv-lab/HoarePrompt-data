Functionality: **The function reads two inputs from the standard input: the number of test cases \( t \) and an array \( a \) of length \( n \). It then calculates and prints either "2" along with two indices or "-1" based on specific conditions involving the minimum exclusive element (Mex) and its counterparts. Specifically, the function iterates through the array \( a \), updating counts of each element's occurrence, and checks if there are any pairs of indices that satisfy certain conditions related to the Mex values. If such a pair is found, it prints "2" followed by the pair of indices; otherwise, it prints "-1". The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no valid pair of indices satisfying the conditions is found, the function will print "-1".

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code does not handle the scenario where there are multiple test cases. It only processes one test case. To handle multiple test cases, the function would need to loop over \( t \) times, processing each array \( a \) individually.
