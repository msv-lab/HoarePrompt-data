To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the given state.

The loop condition is:
```
while another_have[another_mex]:
```

This means the loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`
- `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`
- `another_mex` is 1
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1

From the information provided, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1. Since `another_mex` is 1, it means that `another_have[1]` is non-zero (it has been incremented by 1).

For the loop to continue, `another_have[another_mex]` must remain non-zero. This means that the element at index `another_mex` (which is 1) in the `another_have` list must stay non-zero. 

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the existing state because `another_have[1]` is already non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 1, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1**
