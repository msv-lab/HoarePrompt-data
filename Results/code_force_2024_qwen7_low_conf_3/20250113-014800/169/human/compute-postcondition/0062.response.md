To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the loop continues.

The loop condition is:
```python
while another_have[another_mex]:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is greater than 0.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged
- `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
- `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must be greater than 0. The current state already ensures this because `another_have[a[i]]` is initially greater than 0 and is incremented by 1, meaning `another_have[another_mex]` is still greater than 0.

Therefore, no additional state adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`; `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1**
