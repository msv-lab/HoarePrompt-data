Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged
- `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1)
- `another_mex` is the original value plus 1 (`len(another_have) - 1 - 1 + 1`)
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`
- `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is true. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is true. This means that `another_mex` must be a value for which `another_have[another_mex]` is greater than 0.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`.
   - `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0.

Given this information, we need to ensure that `another_have[another_mex]` is still greater than 0 for the next iteration. Since `another_mex` is derived from `len(another_have) - 1 - 1 + 1`, it simplifies to `len(another_have) - 2 + 1 = len(another_have) - 1`.

However, since `another_have` has `n + 1` elements, and one of them (at index `a[i]`) is greater than 0, all indices from 0 to `n` are considered. The value of `another_mex` should be within the range where `another_have` still has a count of `a[i]`.

### Adjusting the State
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `another_have[a[i]]` must remain greater than 0. Therefore, no changes are necessary to `another_have` itself because it already meets the condition.

### Conclusion
Since `another_have[a[i]]` is already greater than 0, no adjustments are needed in the state for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is the original value plus 1 (`len(another_have) - 1 - 1 + 1`), `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`, and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0**.

This state ensures that the loop can execute one more time based on the given conditions.
