Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is `len(another_have)`, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`.
   - `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`.
   - `another_mex` is 0.
   - `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop runs while `another_have[another_mex]` is true.
   - In each iteration, `another_mex` is incremented by 1 until it finds an index where `another_have[another_mex]` is false.
   - This means `another_mex` will be the smallest index for which `another_have[another_mex]` is 0.

3. **Final State After Loop Execution:**
   - Since the loop continues to increment `another_mex` until it reaches the first index where `another_have[another_mex]` is 0, `another_mex` will be equal to the length of `another_have` when the loop terminates.
   - `another_have` will have one of its elements incremented by 1, representing the index that was found to be the smallest non-zero index.

Thus, after the loop completes, `another_mex` will be the length of `another_have`, and `another_have` will have one of its elements incremented by 1.
