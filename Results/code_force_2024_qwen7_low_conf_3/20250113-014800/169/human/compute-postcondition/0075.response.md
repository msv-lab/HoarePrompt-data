Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero after all the updates, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` after all the decrements, `another_mex` is the largest integer `m` such that `another_have[m]` is zero after all the increments, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` after all the increments, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.** 

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it retains its initial value.
- **`n`**: This variable is also not modified within the loop, so it retains its initial value.
- **`a`**: The list `a` is not directly modified by the loop. However, the counts in `cur_have` and `another_have` reflect the occurrences of elements in `a`.
- **`cur_mex`**: This is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero. This value is updated during the loop whenever `cur_have[a[i]]` becomes zero and `cur_mex > a[i]`.
- **`cur_have`**: This list keeps track of the count of occurrences of each integer in `a`. After the loop, `cur_have[i]` will be the count of `i` in `a` minus the number of times `i` was encountered in the loop.
- **`another_mex`**: This is the largest integer `m` such that `another_have[m]` is zero. It is updated whenever `another_have[another_mex]` becomes zero during the while loop.
- **`another_have`**: This list keeps track of the count of occurrences of each integer in `a`. After the loop, `another_have[i]` will be the count of `i` in `a` plus the number of times `i` was encountered in the loop.

Since the loop continues until `cur_mex` equals `another_mex`, and both `cur_have` and `another_have` are updated in a way that reflects the occurrences of elements in `a`, the final state ensures that `cur_mex` is the smallest integer for which `cur_have` is zero, and `another_mex` is the largest integer for which `another_have` is zero. These conditions guarantee that `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.
