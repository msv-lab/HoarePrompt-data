The code `another_mex += 1` increments the value of `another_mex` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `another_mex` was calculated as `len(another_have) - 1 - 1` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Since the value of `another_mex` was dependent on `len(another_have)` and the current value of `another_have[a[i]]`, incrementing `another_mex` by 1 updates its value accordingly. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is the original value plus 1 (`len(another_have) - 1 - 1 + 1`), `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`, and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0.**
