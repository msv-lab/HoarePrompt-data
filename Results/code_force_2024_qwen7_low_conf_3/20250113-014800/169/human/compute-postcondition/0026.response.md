To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop will continue to execute.

The loop condition is:
```
while another_have[another_mex]:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is not zero.

### Current State Before the Loop
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`
- `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`
- `another_mex` is 0
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros

### Analysis
Since `another_mex` is initially set to 0, the loop condition becomes:
```
while another_have[0]:
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[0]` must be non-zero. Given that `another_have` was initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, the only way for `another_have[0]` to be non-zero is if it has been incremented by 1 during the execution of the loop body.

### Adjustment Needed
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `another_have[0]` is non-zero. This means we need to increment the value at index `0` in `another_have` by 1.

### Final State
The state right before the loop should be:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements (specifically the element at index 0) incremented by 1.**

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1.**
