Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`.
- `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`.
- `another_mex` is `len(another_have) - 1`.
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1.
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` was the value it had at the end of the previous iteration. Let's denote this as `i_prev`.
   - Since `i` was the last value processed, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i_prev + 1`.
   - `cur_mex` and `cur_have` might be updated based on the value of `a[i_prev + 1]` but we don't have specific details on how they change.
   - `another_mex` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.
   - `another_have` might be updated, but the exact changes are not specified in the problem statement.

Given these points, let's summarize the new state:

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (we don't know the exact value but it follows the same logic as before).
- `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (decreased count for `a[i_prev + 1]`).
- `another_mex` remains `len(another_have) - 1` as it is not affected by the loop.
- `another_have` might be updated but without specifics, we assume it remains the same for now.
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]`, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]`, `another_mex` is `len(another_have) - 1`, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.**

Since we cannot specify the exact values of `cur_mex` and `cur_have` without the loop body, we leave them as described above.
