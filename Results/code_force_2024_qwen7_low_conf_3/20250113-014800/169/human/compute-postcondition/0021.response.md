The code `cur_have[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i]` in the `cur_have` list. Given the initial state, this means that the count of `a[i]` in the `cur_have` list will be decreased by 1. No other changes occur to the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
