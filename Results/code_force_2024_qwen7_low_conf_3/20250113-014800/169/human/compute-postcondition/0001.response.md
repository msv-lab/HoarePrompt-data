The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `mex`. The initial value of `mex` is not specified, but it is now explicitly set to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1]; `num_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `arr`; `mex` is `0`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1]; `num_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `arr`; `mex` is `0`**
