The code snippet updates the value of `cur_mex` to be equal to `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

- `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]`.
- `n`, `a`, `cur_have`, `another_mex`, `another_have`, and `cur_mex` being not equal to `another_mex` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is `len(another_have) - 1`, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.**
