The code prints the string `'1 ' + str(i + 1)`, which means it prints the string `1` followed by the value of `i + 1`. This does not change the values of any variables directly but updates the console output.

The output of the print statement is not stored in any variable, so the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the console output.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`, and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Additionally, the condition `cur_mex == another_mex` is true; the console output contains the string '1 ' followed by the value of `i + 1`.**
