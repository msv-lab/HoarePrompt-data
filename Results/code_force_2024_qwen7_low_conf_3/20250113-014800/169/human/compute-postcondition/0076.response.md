The code snippet prints `-1`. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero after all the updates, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` after all the decrements, `another_mex` is the largest integer `m` such that `another_have[m]` is zero after all the increments, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` after all the increments, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`. The code prints `-1`.**
