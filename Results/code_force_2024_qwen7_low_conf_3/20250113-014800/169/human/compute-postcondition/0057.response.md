Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged.
   - `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1).
   - `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed.
   - `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`.
   - `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0.
   - `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Each iteration updates the state based on the current value of `i`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, at the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, and assuming the loop has already executed for `i = 0, 1, ..., i-1`, the next value of `i` will be `i`.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - `cur_mex` may change if it was equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` changes.
   - `cur_have` will be updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]`.
   - `another_mex` will increase by 1 because the loop has executed one more time.
   - `another_have` will have one more occurrence of `a[i]` added to it.

Thus, the new states at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes `i`.
- `another_mex` increases by 1.
- `another_have[a[i]]` will be greater than 0.
- `cur_mex` may change depending on the value of `a[i]`.

Considering the above points, we can summarize the new states as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]`, `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]`, `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`**.
