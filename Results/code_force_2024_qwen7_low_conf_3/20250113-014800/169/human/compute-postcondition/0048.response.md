Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged
   - `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1)
   - `another_mex` is `original_value + 2`
   - `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`
   - `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is true.

3. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `another_mex` is `original_value + 2`
   - `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must be true.
   - Given that `another_mex` is fixed at `original_value + 2` and `another_have[a[i]]` is already greater than 0, the only condition we need to consider is that `another_have[another_mex]` must be true after the update in this iteration.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `another_mex` is `original_value + 2` and `another_have[a[i]]` is already greater than 0, the key here is ensuring that `another_have[another_mex]` is still true after the update in the current iteration.
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition is directly dependent on `another_have[another_mex]`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is `original_value + 2`, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`, and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0**
