The code `another_mex += 1` increments the value of `another_mex` by 1. Given the precondition that `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and `another_mex` must be less than `n + 1`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `another_have[another_mex]` remains greater than 0.

Since `another_mex` is incremented by 1, the new value of `another_mex` will still be within the bounds of `0` to `n`. The values of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `cur_mex`, `cur_have`, and `another_have` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `another_mex` is increased by 1 and is less than `n + 1`**
