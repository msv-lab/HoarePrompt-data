`cur_mex` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is an element in the list `a`, which is one of the elements from the initial list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`**.
