The code snippet `print(str(i + 2) + ' ' + str(n))` does not affect the values of the variables directly but prints the values of `i + 2` and `n`. Since the initial state includes that `n` is greater than 0 and `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, and `cur_mex` is `a[1]`, the output of the print statement will be `3` (because `i + 2` will be `1 + 2`) and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is `a[1]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[1]`, `another_mex` is `n`, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1, and the condition `cur_mex == another_mex` holds true; the console prints `3` and `n`.**
