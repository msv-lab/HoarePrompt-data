Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0 and `cur_mex` is greater than `a[i]`***
