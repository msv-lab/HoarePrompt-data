The code prints `i + 2` and `n`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `k + 1`. After printing, the variables `i`, `n`, and the printed values will be updated. The states of other variables (`t`, `a`, `cur_mex`, `cur_have`, `another_have`, and `another_mex`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 3`, `n` is greater than 0, printed values are `k + 3` and `n`**, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `another_mex` is the smallest index in `another_have` that was incremented by 1 during the loop.
