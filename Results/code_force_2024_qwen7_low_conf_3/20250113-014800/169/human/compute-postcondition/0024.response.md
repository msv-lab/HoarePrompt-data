Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.***
