`cur_mex` is incremented by 1. The initial state was that `cur_mex` is two more than its initial value and `cur_have[cur_mex]` must be `True`. After incrementing `cur_mex` by 1, the new value of `cur_mex` is one more than its initial value, and `cur_have[cur_mex]` must still be `True`.

Output State: **`cur_mex` is one more than its initial value; `cur_have[cur_mex]` is True**
