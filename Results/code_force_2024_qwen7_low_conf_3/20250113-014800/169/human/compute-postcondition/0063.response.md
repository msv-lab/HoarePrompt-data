`another_mex` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`; `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `another_mex` is increased by 1.
