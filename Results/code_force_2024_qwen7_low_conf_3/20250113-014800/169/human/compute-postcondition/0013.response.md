To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition that drives the loop: `cur_have[cur_mex]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `cur_mex` is 1.
   - `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`.
   - `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `cur_have[cur_mex]` is true (non-zero).

3. **Current State**:
   - `cur_mex` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `cur_have[1]` must be non-zero.

4. **Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `cur_mex` is fixed at 1, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cur_have[1]` to ensure it remains non-zero.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_have[1]` must remain non-zero.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is 1, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` and `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero, and `cur_have[1]` must be non-zero.**
