The code `cur_have[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i]` in the `cur_have` list. Since `cur_have` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` (meaning `cur_have[a[i]]` is 1), decrementing this value results in `cur_have[a[i]]` becoming 0. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cur_have[a[i]]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`**
