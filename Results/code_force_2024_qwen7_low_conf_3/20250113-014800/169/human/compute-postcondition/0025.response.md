The code `another_have[a[i]] += 1` increments the count at the index `a[i]` in the list `another_have`. Since `a` is a list of integers and `another_have` is initialized as a list of `n + 1` zeros, this operation will update `another_have` to have an incremented value at the index corresponding to `a[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`
- `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`
- `another_mex` is 0
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros

After executing the code snippet, the only change is in the `another_have` list, which will have its value at index `a[i]` incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1.**
