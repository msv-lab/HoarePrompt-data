The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` is at least 2, and each element in `arr` is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1]. The function calculates the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`, where `num_set` is derived from `arr`. The function does not modify `num_set` but returns `mex`, the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set derived from `arr`, without modifying the set.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set derived from `arr`.**
