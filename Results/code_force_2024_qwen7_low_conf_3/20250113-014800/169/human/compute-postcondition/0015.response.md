According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur_have[cur_mex]`. If `cur_have[cur_mex]` is `True`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_mex` is one more than its previous value. However, this alone does not provide enough information about the value of `cur_have[cur_mex]` or `cur_mex` itself.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is `True` when the loop starts the next iteration. Since `cur_mex` has increased by one, the new value of `cur_mex` will be the previous value of `cur_mex` plus one.

Given that no additional constraints are provided about the values of `cur_have` array, we can only ensure that the condition `cur_have[cur_mex]` is `True`.

State: **`cur_mex` is two more than its initial value and `cur_have[cur_mex]` must be `True`**
