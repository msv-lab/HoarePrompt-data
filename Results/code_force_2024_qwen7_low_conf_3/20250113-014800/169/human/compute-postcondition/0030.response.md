Let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`
- `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`
- `another_mex` is 2
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1

### While Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is true.

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `another_mex` is 2
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1

### Analysis:
1. **Condition of the While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `another_have[2]` is true.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `another_have` has one of its elements incremented by 1. This means that `another_have[2]` is true.

For the loop to continue, `another_have[2]` must remain true. Since `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1, the only way to ensure `another_have[2]` remains true is to keep the same state because no information suggests otherwise.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time because the condition `another_have[2]` is already satisfied.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 2, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1**
