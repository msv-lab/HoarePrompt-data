To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `another_have[another_mex]`. This condition must evaluate to `True` for the loop to proceed.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged
- `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1)
- `another_mex` is `len(another_have) - 1 - 1` (because `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1)
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex` if it was not changed in the if part

The key variable here is `another_have[another_mex]`. For the loop to execute at least once, this condition must be true, meaning `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero (greater than 0).

Since `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros initially, and `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `another_have[a[i]]` has been incremented at least once before the loop starts.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is `len(another_have) - 1 - 1` (because `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1), `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`, and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0.**
