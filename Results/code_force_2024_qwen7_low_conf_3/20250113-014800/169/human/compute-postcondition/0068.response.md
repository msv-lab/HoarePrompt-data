Let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged
- `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
- `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1

### Code of the Loop:
```python
while another_have[another_mex]:
    another_mex += 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - The loop starts with `another_have[another_mex]` being true (since `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0).
   - `another_mex` is incremented by 1.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `another_mex` is now `another_mex + 1`.
   - The loop checks `another_have[another_mex]`. Since `another_have` is a list of zeros except for one index which is incremented by 1, `another_have[another_mex]` will be true only if `another_mex` matches that index.
   - If `another_mex` does not match the index, `another_mex` is incremented again.
   - This process continues until `another_mex` equals the index in `another_have` that was incremented.

3. **General Iteration**:
   - Each time the loop runs, `another_mex` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop stops when `another_mex` equals the index in `another_have` that was incremented.

### Final State:
- After the loop finishes, `another_mex` will be set to the index in `another_have` that was incremented by 1 during the loop.
- Since the loop increments `another_mex` each time it runs, the final value of `another_mex` will be the smallest index in `another_have` that was incremented by 1.

### Output State:
- `t` remains the same: an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` remains the same: greater than 0
- `a` remains the same: a list of integers
- `cur_mex` remains the same: either equal to `a[i]` or unchanged
- `cur_have` remains the same: updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0
- `another_have` remains the same: a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0
- `cur_mex` remains the same: not equal to `another_mex`
- `another_have[a[i]]` remains the same: incremented by 1
- `another_mex` will be set to the smallest index in `another_have` that was incremented by 1 during the loop.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `another_mex` is the smallest index in `another_have` that was incremented by 1 during the loop.**
