The code `another_have[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the list `another_have` by 1. Given the initial state, the only affected variable is `another_have[a[i]]`.

- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros initially.
- `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

Since `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are not directly affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Also, `cur_have` is not directly modified, so its state also remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`; `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
