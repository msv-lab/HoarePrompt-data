The given code snippet updates the value of `i` by incrementing it by 1 and then prints the value of `i + 1`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`. Since the initial state only mentions that `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and other variables are initialized accordingly, the only thing that changes is the value of `i`.

Let's assume the initial value of `i` is `k` (where `k` is an integer). After executing the line `print('1 ' + str(i + 1))`, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `another_mex` is the smallest index in `another_have` that was incremented by 1 during the loop, `i` is `k + 1`**.
