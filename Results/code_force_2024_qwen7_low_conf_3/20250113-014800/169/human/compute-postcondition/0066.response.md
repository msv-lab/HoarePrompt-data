To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step:

1. The loop condition is `while another_have[another_mex]:`.
2. This means the loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

Given the current state:
- `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0.
- `another_mex` is increased by 1 and is less than `n + 1`.

Since `another_have[another_mex]` is checked in the loop condition, for the loop to continue, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero. 

Given the context, `another_mex` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `n + 1`. Since `another_have[a[i]]` is already greater than 0 and `another_mex` is less than `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `another_mex` is incremented to the next index where `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `another_mex` is incremented to the next valid index (i.e., `another_mex` should be the smallest index where `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero, but since we know it is less than `n + 1` and already has one non-zero entry at `a[i]`, we just need to ensure it is incremented).

So, the adjustment needed is to ensure `another_mex` is incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `another_mex` is increased by 1 and is less than `n + 1`, `another_mex` must be incremented by 1**.
