Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`. If `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]`. Otherwise, `cur_mex` remains unchanged.***
