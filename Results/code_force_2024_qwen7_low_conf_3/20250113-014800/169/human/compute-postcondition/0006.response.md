Let's analyze the given conditions and the while loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `mex` is `mex + 1`, `mex + 1` must be in `num_set`.
- The while loop condition: `while mex in num_set:`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Condition**: After the previous iteration, `mex` was incremented by 1, making it `mex + 1`. This value `mex + 1` must be present in `num_set`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `mex` is in `num_set`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must be in `num_set` at the start of the next iteration. Since `mex` starts as `mex + 1` from the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state such that `mex + 1` is still in `num_set` when the next iteration begins.

### Required Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `mex + 1` is in `num_set` at the start of the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `mex` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
- Therefore, `mex + 1` must be in `num_set` at the start of the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`mex + 1` must be in `num_set`**
