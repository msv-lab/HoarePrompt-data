`another_mex` is incremented by 1. The value of `another_mex` was originally `original_value + 1`, where `original_value` is `len(another_have) - 1 - 1`. After incrementing, `another_mex` becomes `original_value + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is `original_value + 2`, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`, and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0**
