To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop will start iterating over the `range(n)`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` until `i < n`. Therefore, `i` should start at 0 or less, but since `i` is incremented within the loop, we only need to ensure `i` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to proceed.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the loop will run for `n` iterations. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer and at least 1. Given the problem constraints, `n` is between 2 and \(10^5\).

3. **List `a`**: The list `a` is used in determining `cur_mex` and `cur_have`. Since no operations directly modifying `a` are mentioned inside the loop, we don't need to adjust its initial state for the loop to execute.

4. **`cur_mex`**: This variable is derived from `cur_have`, which counts occurrences of integers in `a`. No specific initial condition for `cur_mex` is required to start the loop, as its value is computed within the loop.

5. **`cur_have`**: This list should be initialized correctly. However, since the exact values of `cur_have` are not critical for the loop to start (it's only important that it exists and has the correct length `n+1`), no adjustment is needed here specifically for the loop to start.

6. **`another_mex` and `another_have`**: These variables are not referenced in the loop condition and their initial values do not affect the loop's execution. They are set to 0 and a list of zeros respectively, which is sufficient for the loop to start.

Based on these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:

- `n` must be at least 1 (and given the problem constraints, it is between 2 and \(10^5\)).

Since `i` starts at 0 and `a`, `cur_mex`, `cur_have`, `another_mex`, and `another_have` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, the final answer is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**.
