Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is `len(another_have) - 1`, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex` if it was not changed in the if part.***
