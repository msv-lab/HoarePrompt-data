`another_mex` is incremented by 1. The value of `another_mex` was previously 0, so it is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 1, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1.**
