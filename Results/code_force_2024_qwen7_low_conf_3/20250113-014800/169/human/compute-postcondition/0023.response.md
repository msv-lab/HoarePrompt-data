The code sets `cur_mex` to the value of `a[i]`. Given the precondition that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0 and `cur_mex` is greater than `a[i]`, this implies that `cur_mex` was originally greater than `a[i]` and now it is set to `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is now `a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cur_have[a[i]]` is now 0.**
