The code creates a set `num_set` from the list `arr`. A set contains unique elements, so any duplicates in `arr` will be removed. The length of `num_set` will be less than or equal to the length of `arr`, and each element in `num_set` will be unique.

Given the initial state where `arr` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2 and each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1], the output state will be:

- `arr` remains unchanged as the code only creates a new set from its elements.
- `num_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1]; `num_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `arr`.**
