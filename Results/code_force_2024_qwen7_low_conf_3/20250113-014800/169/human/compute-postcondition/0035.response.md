The code `print('1 ' + str(i + 1))` prints a string "1 (i + 1)" where `i` is an index related to the list `a`. However, the value of `i` itself is not directly given in the problem statement, only that the condition `cur_mex == another_mex` holds true and the console prints `2`.

Given the print statement outputs `2`, we can infer that `i + 1` equals `2`, meaning `i` is `1`. This implies that the code is checking the first element of the list `a` to update `cur_mex` and `cur_have`.

Since `i` is `1`, `cur_mex` is updated to `a[1]` and `cur_have[a[1]]` is decremented by 1. Also, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1, and `another_mex` is the length of `another_have` minus the number of zeros, which is `n`.

The condition `cur_mex == another_mex` must hold true, implying that the updated `cur_mex` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is `a[1]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[1]`, `another_mex` is `n`, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1, and the condition `cur_mex == another_mex` holds true. The console prints `1 2`.**
