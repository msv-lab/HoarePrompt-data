To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues.

The loop condition is:
```python
while another_have[another_mex]:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero (i.e., greater than 0).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged
- `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
- `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1
- `another_mex` is increased by 1

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `another_have[another_mex]` is greater than 0 (since `another_have[a[i]]` was incremented by 1 in the last iteration)

For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must remain greater than 0. Since `another_have[a[i]]` was incremented by 1 in the last iteration, `another_have[another_mex]` will still be greater than 0 unless `another_mex` has been incremented to a point where `another_have[another_mex]` becomes zero.

However, the problem statement specifies that `another_mex` is increased by 1 in each iteration, so we need to ensure that `another_have[another_mex]` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `another_mex` is less than the length of `another_have`, which is `n + 1`.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged
- `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0
- `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
- `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1
- `another_mex` must be less than `n + 1` (i.e., `another_mex < n + 1`)
