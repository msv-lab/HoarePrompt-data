`cur_mex` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cur_mex` is 0, so after the increment, `cur_mex` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is 1, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` and `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero**
