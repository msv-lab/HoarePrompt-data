To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step and use the information provided about the initial state and the states after a few iterations.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `cur_mex` is 0
- `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`

### Loop Code:
```python
while cur_have[cur_mex]:
    cur_mex += 1
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - The loop starts with `cur_mex = 0`.
   - The condition `cur_have[cur_mex]` is checked.
   - If `cur_have[0]` is non-zero, `cur_mex` is incremented to 1.
   - After the first iteration, `cur_mex` is 1, and `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The loop now checks `cur_have[1]`.
   - If `cur_have[1]` is non-zero, `cur_mex` is incremented to 2.
   - After the second iteration, `cur_mex` is 2, and `cur_have[1]` must be non-zero.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - The loop now checks `cur_have[2]`.
   - If `cur_have[2]` is non-zero, `cur_mex` is incremented to 3.
   - After the third iteration, `cur_mex` is 3, and `cur_have[2]` must be non-zero.

From these observations, we can generalize that after `k` iterations of the loop, `cur_mex` will be `k + 1` and `cur_have[k]` must be non-zero.

### Conclusion:
After all the iterations of the loop have executed, `cur_mex` will be the maximum value of `i` such that `cur_have[i]` is non-zero. This means that `cur_mex` will be the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero.

### Output State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero
- `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`**
