According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mex`. If `mex` is in `num_set`, the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `mex` has been incremented by 1.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the condition `mex in num_set`. Since `mex` was incremented in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the new value of `mex` (let's call it `new_mex`) is still in `num_set`.

The previous value of `mex` was `mex_old` (which is `mex - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `mex_old + 1` must be in `num_set`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `mex + 1` (the current value of `mex` after incrementing) must be in `num_set`.

State: **`mex` is `mex + 1` and `mex + 1` must be in `num_set`**
