The code snippet simply prints `2`. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The only change is that the program outputs `2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `another_mex` is the smallest index in `another_have` that was incremented by 1 during the loop; the program outputs `2`**.
