The code `print(2)` simply prints the integer `2` to the console. It does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` is updated based on `a[i_prev + 1]` (specifically, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1), `another_mex` is the original value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]`, and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Additionally, the condition `cur_mex == another_mex` is true.**
