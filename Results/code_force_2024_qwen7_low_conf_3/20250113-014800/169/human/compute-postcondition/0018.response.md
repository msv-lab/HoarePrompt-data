The code snippet sets `another_mex` to 0. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `another_mex` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer `m` such that `cur_have[m]` is zero, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` (from 0 to `n`) represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `another_mex` is 0**.
