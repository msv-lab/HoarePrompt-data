`mex` is incremented by 1. The initial state is that `mex + 1` must be in `num_set`. After executing `mex += 1`, the new value of `mex` is `mex + 1`, which means `mex` is now equal to `mex + 1 - 1 = mex`. Since `mex + 1` was originally in `num_set`, after incrementing `mex` by 1, `mex` itself (which is now `mex + 1 - 1`) should also be in `num_set`.

Output State: **`mex` is `mex + 1 - 1`; `mex + 1` is in `num_set`**
