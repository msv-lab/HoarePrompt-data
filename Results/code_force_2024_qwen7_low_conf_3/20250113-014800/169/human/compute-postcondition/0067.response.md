The code `another_mex += 1` increments the value of `another_mex` by 1. Given that `another_mex` is initially an integer and is less than `n + 1`, and it must be incremented by 1, the new value of `another_mex` will be the previous value of `another_mex` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are integers where `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` or remains unchanged, `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is 0, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one more occurrence of `a[i]` and `another_have[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, the new value of `another_mex` is `another_mex + 1`, and `another_mex` is less than `n + 1`.**
