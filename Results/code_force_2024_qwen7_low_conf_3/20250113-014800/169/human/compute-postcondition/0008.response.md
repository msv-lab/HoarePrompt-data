Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1].
- `num_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `arr`.
- `mex` is `0`.

### Loop Code:
```python
while mex in num_set:
    mex += 1
```

### Analysis:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `mex` starts at `0`.
   - Since `0` is in `num_set`, the loop executes.
   - `mex` is incremented to `1`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `mex` is now `1`.
   - Since `1` is in `num_set`, the loop executes.
   - `mex` is incremented to `2`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `mex` is now `2`.
   - Since `2` is in `num_set`, the loop executes.
   - `mex` is incremented to `3`.

4. **General Pattern**:
   - After `k` iterations, `mex` is `k`.
   - The loop continues as long as `mex` is in `num_set`.

5. **Final Iteration**:
   - Let's denote the maximum value in `num_set` as `max_val`.
   - Once `mex` reaches `max_val + 1`, `mex` will no longer be in `num_set`, and the loop will terminate.

### Conclusion:
After the loop terminates, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.

### Output State:
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.
- `num_set` remains unchanged as it is only used to check the presence of `mex`.

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`, `num_set` remains unchanged.**
