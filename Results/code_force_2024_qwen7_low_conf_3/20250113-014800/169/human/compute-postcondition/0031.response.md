`another_mex` is incremented by 1. Since `another_mex` was initially 2, after the increment, `another_mex` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cur_mex` is either unchanged or updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, `cur_have` is a list of integers where each index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` decreased by one for the current element `a[i]`, `another_mex` is 3, `another_have` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with one of its elements incremented by 1**
