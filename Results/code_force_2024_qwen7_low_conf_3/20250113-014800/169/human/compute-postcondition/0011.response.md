Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers where each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1] and the length of the list is at least 2. It computes the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set of unique elements derived from `arr`. The function returns this integer, which is stored in the variable `mex`. The set `num_set`, which contains the unique elements from `arr`, remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. This process involves initializing `num_set` with the unique elements from `arr`, then incrementing `mex` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If all integers from 0 to len(arr) - 2 are present in `arr`, the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set` would be len(arr) - 1.
- If `arr` contains duplicates, the function correctly handles them by using a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
- If `arr` contains integers outside the range [0, len(arr) - 1], the function still works as expected because these values are not included in `num_set`.
