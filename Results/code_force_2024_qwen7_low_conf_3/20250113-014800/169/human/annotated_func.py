#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1].

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1].
    #- `num_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `arr`.
    #- `mex` is `0`.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #while mex in num_set:
    #    mex += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration**:
    #   - `mex` starts at `0`.
    #   - Since `0` is in `num_set`, the loop executes.
    #   - `mex` is incremented to `1`.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration**:
    #   - `mex` is now `1`.
    #   - Since `1` is in `num_set`, the loop executes.
    #   - `mex` is incremented to `2`.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration**:
    #   - `mex` is now `2`.
    #   - Since `2` is in `num_set`, the loop executes.
    #   - `mex` is incremented to `3`.
    #
    #4. **General Pattern**:
    #   - After `k` iterations, `mex` is `k`.
    #   - The loop continues as long as `mex` is in `num_set`.
    #
    #5. **Final Iteration**:
    #   - Let's denote the maximum value in `num_set` as `max_val`.
    #   - Once `mex` reaches `max_val + 1`, `mex` will no longer be in `num_set`, and the loop will terminate.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #After the loop terminates, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.
    #- `num_set` remains unchanged as it is only used to check the presence of `mex`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #**Output State: `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`, `num_set` remains unchanged.**
    return mex
    #`mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`, `num_set` remains unchanged
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers where each element is in the range [0, len(arr) - 1] and the length of the list is at least 2. It computes the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set of unique elements derived from `arr`. The function returns this integer, which is stored in the variable `mex`. The set `num_set`, which contains the unique elements from `arr`, remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. This process involves initializing `num_set` with the unique elements from `arr`, then incrementing `mex` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.
