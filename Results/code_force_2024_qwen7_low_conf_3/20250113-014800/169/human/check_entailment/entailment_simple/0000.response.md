Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself for each test case.
   - The program ensures that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array. It initializes a set with the unique elements of the array and increments `mex` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - This matches the definition of MEX provided in the problem description.

3. **Division into Subsegments:**
   - The main loop iterates through the array to find subsegments where the MEX is equal to the calculated `mex`.
   - It uses a `set` to keep track of the numbers encountered in the current segment. When the size of this set reaches `mex`, it indicates that the MEX of the segment is `mex`. The program then updates the subsegment boundaries and clears the set.
   - If a segment spans the entire array, it is handled appropriately.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program outputs the number of subsegments and the boundaries of each subsegment in the required format.
   - It handles cases where no valid division exists by outputting `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like arrays where the MEX is `0` or where no valid division exists.
   - It correctly outputs `2` subsegments for arrays where the MEX is `0`, as per the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis, the program accurately implements the solution to the problem and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
