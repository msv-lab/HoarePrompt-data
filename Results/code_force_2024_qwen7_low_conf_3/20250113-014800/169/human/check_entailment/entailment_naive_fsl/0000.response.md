Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the `MEX` value is 0. According to the problem description, if the `MEX` value is 0, the array should be split into two subsegments, each containing only one element. However, the current implementation does not handle this case properly. Specifically, the check `if mex == 0:` is insufficient to ensure the correct splitting of the array. Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 0 0 0
```

The correct output should be:
```
2
1 1
2 4
```

But the provided program will output:
```
-1
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where all elements are less than the `MEX` value, which is 0 in this scenario. Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases.
