You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In the Master's Assistance Center, Nyam-Nyam was given a homework assignment
in informatics.

There is an array a of length n , and you want to divide it into k > 1
subsegments^{\dagger} in such a way that the \operatorname{MEX} ^{\ddagger} on
each subsegment is equal to the same integer.

Help Nyam-Nyam find any suitable division, or determine that it does not
exist.

^{\dagger} A division of an array into k subsegments is defined as k pairs of
integers (l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \ldots, (l_k, r_k) such that l_i \le r_i and
for each 1 \le j \le k - 1 , l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1 , and also l_1 = 1 and r_k =
n . These pairs represent the subsegments themselves.

^{\ddagger}\operatorname{MEX} of an array is the smallest non-negative integer
that does not belong to the array.

For example:

  * \operatorname{MEX} of the array [2, 2, 1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the array [3, 1, 0, 1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the array [0, 3, 1, 2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer -1 if a suitable division does not
exist.

Otherwise, on the first line, output an integer k (2 \le k \le n ) — the
number of subsegments in the division.

Then output k lines — the division into subsegments. The i -th line should
contain two integers l_i and r_i (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the boundaries
of the i -th subsegment.

The following conditions must be satisfied:

  * For all 1 \le j \le k - 1 , l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1 ;
  * l_1 = 1 , r_k = n .

If there are multiple possible solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    0 0
    
    5
    
    0 1 2 3 4
    
    8
    
    0 1 7 1 0 1 0 3
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 0

Output

    2
    1 1
    2 2
    -1
    3
    1 3
    4 5
    6 8
    3
    1 1
    2 2
    3 3
    -1

Note

In the first test case, the array a can be divided into 2 subsegments with
boundaries [1, 1] and [2, 2] :

  * \operatorname{MEX} of the first subsegment [0] is 1 , as 0 belongs to the subsegment, but 1 does not. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the second subsegment [0] is 1 , as 0 belongs to the subsegment, but 1 does not. 

In the second test case, it can be proven that the required division does not
exist.

In the third test case, the array a can be divided into 3 subsegments with
boundaries [1, 3] , [4, 5] , [6, 8] :

  * \operatorname{MEX} of the first subsegment [0, 1, 7] is 2 , as 0 and 1 belong to the subsegment, but 2 does not. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the second subsegment [1, 0] is 2 , as 0 and 1 belong to the subsegment, but 2 does not. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the third subsegment [1, 0, 3] is 2 , as 0 and 1 belong to the subsegment, but 2 does not.
Program:
```
test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(test_cases):
    size = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = func_1(arr)
    if mex == 0:
        print(2)
        print(1, 1)
        print(2, size)
        continue
    cnt = 0
    start = 0
    segments = []
    num_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        if arr[i] < mex:
            num_set.add(arr[i])
        if len(num_set) == mex:
            segments.append((start + 1, i + 1))
            start = i + 1
            num_set.clear()
    if num_set:
        segments[-1] = (segments[-1][0], size)
    if len(segments) < 2:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(segments))
        for seg in segments:
            print(seg[0], seg[1])

def func_1(arr):
    num_set = set(arr)
    mex = 0
    while mex in num_set:
        mex += 1
    return mex


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
