Reasoning:
1. The problem requires dividing an array into subsegments such that the MEX (minimum excluded) of each subsegment is the same.
2. The provided solution includes a `func_1` function that correctly calculates the MEX of the array. This function initializes a set with the unique elements of the array and then iterates to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
3. In the main loop of the program, the solution attempts to divide the array into subsegments based on the calculated MEX value.
4. The logic for determining subsegments is sound: it collects elements until the set size matches the MEX value, indicating that all smaller integers are present in the set. Then it creates a new segment and clears the set for the next segment.
5. The program handles edge cases, such as when the MEX is 0, and provides appropriate output.
6. The program checks if the number of segments is less than 2 and outputs `-1` if so, which is the correct behavior if no valid segmentation exists.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and follows the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
