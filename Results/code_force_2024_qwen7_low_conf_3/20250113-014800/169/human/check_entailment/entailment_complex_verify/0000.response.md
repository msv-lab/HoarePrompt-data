### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program against the problem statement and the given annotations.

#### Problem Statement Analysis

1. **Functionality Requirement**: We need to divide the array into `k` subsegments such that the `MEX` of each subsegment is the same integer.
2. **Special Case Handling**: If `MEX` is 0, the array can be divided into two subsegments each containing a single element (i.e., `[0]` and the rest).
3. **Output Format**: If such a division exists, we output the number of subsegments followed by the start and end indices of each subsegment. If no such division exists, we output `-1`.

#### Provided Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Computes the `MEX` of the array.
   - Uses a set to store unique elements of the array and increments `mex` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - For each test case:
     - Computes the `MEX` using `func_1`.
     - Checks if `MEX` is 0:
       - If `MEX` is 0, prints `2` subsegments and outputs the indices `[1, 1]` and `[2, size]`.
     - Otherwise, iterates through the array to form subsegments where the `MEX` of each segment is `MEX`.
     - Prints the number of subsegments and their respective indices.

#### Annotation Review

The annotation explains that the `func_1` function correctly computes the `MEX` of the array. The main program logic handles the special case when `MEX` is 0 by outputting the correct subsegments `[1, 1]` and `[2, size]`.

#### Correctness Evaluation

1. **Special Case Handling**:
   - When `MEX` is 0, the program correctly outputs `2` subsegments: `[1, 1]` and `[2, size]`. This ensures that each subsegment has a `MEX` of 0.
   
2. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program iterates through the array and forms subsegments where the `MEX` of each segment is `MEX`. This logic is sound as it ensures that the `MEX` of each segment is consistent.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the `MEX` is 0 by outputting the correct subsegments.
   - For other cases, the program correctly forms subsegments such that the `MEX` of each segment is the same.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
