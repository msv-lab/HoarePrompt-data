### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

#### 1. Initialization
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
- This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

#### 2. Finding MEX
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array. It checks each integer starting from 0 until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

#### 3. Segmentation Logic
- If the MEX is 0, the array can trivially be split into two segments where each segment contains only 0, which has a MEX of 1.
- Otherwise, the program iterates through the array to find segments where the MEX is equal to the calculated MEX value.
- A `num_set` keeps track of numbers encountered so far. When `num_set` contains all numbers up to the MEX, a new segment is started.
- If at the end, there are still numbers left in `num_set`, they are added to the last segment.
- Segments are stored in a list and printed accordingly.

This part of the program needs closer inspection. Let's break it down further:

- **Correctness of Segmentation Logic:**
  - The program tries to ensure that each segment has the same MEX value as calculated by `func_1`.
  - However, the logic for handling the case when `num_set` is not empty at the end of the loop is flawed. Specifically, if `num_set` is not empty, the program directly assigns it to the last segment without checking if this segment already has the correct MEX value. This can lead to incorrect segmentation.

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- MEX: `4` (since `0, 1, 2, 3` are present)
- Expected Output: `4` (since no valid segmentation exists)

However, the program might incorrectly output a segmentation like:
- Segments: `[0, 1, 2]` and `[3]`, both having MEX `3` (which is incorrect).

#### 4. Output Handling
- If no valid segmentation exists, `-1` is printed.
- Otherwise, the number of segments and their boundaries are printed.

This part is correct and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion
The original assessment claimed that the program correctly handles all test cases and adheres to the problem requirements. However, the segmentation logic, particularly the handling of `num_set` at the end of the loop, is flawed. The program might produce incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.

#### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed segmentation logic, especially when `num_set` is not empty at the end of the loop.
