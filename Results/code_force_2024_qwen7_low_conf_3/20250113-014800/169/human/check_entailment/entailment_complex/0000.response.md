Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` computes the MEX of the array `arr`.
   - It initializes a set `num_set` with the unique elements from `arr`.
   - It increments `mex` starting from `0` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.
   - The function returns `mex`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.

2. **Main Program Logic Analysis:**
   - For each test case, the main program:
     - Reads the size of the array and the array itself.
     - Calls `func_1` to compute the MEX of the array.
     - If the MEX is `0`, it prints a simple division into two segments.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through the array to construct segments where the MEX condition holds.
       - It maintains a set `num_set` to track the numbers seen so far.
       - When the size of `num_set` equals `mex`, it indicates that all numbers from `0` to `mex-1` have been seen.
       - It creates a segment ending at the current index and resets `num_set`.
     - If no suitable division is found, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the MEX of the array.
   - The construction of segments ensures that each segment has a MEX equal to `mex`.
   - The handling of edge cases (e.g., when `mex` is `0`) is correctly addressed.
   - The main loop and the segment construction logic are logically sound and follow the problem constraints.

Based on the above analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
