### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to understand how it handles the MEX calculation and the subsequent array division.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX value by initializing a set with the unique elements of the array and then incrementing the MEX value until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.

#### Main Program Analysis:
1. **Handling MEX Value 0**:
   - The program checks if `mex == 0` and prints `2` subsegments with boundaries `[1, 1]` and `[2, size]`.
   - However, this handling is incomplete. If all elements in the array are less than `mex`, the program should still split the array into `k` subsegments where `k` is greater than 1, ensuring that each subsegment has a consistent MEX value.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     0 0 0 0
     ```
     The correct output should be:
     ```
     2
     1 1
     2 4
     ```
     But the current implementation incorrectly outputs `-1`.

2. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program iterates through the array, adding elements to `num_set` until its size equals `mex`.
   - Once `num_set` contains `mex` distinct elements, it appends a new segment to `segments`.
   - After the loop, if `num_set` is not empty, it merges the last segment with the rest of the array.
   - Finally, if the number of segments is less than 2, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the number of segments and their boundaries.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program correctly identifies when the MEX value is 0 and attempts to handle it, but the logic for handling the case where all elements are less than `mex` needs refinement.
   - The program assumes that once `num_set` reaches `mex`, it can be split into subsegments with consistent MEX values, but it does not account for the case where all elements are less than `mex`.

Given these observations, the original assessment correctly points out the flaw in handling the MEX value 0. However, the overall logic for determining the segments is not fully addressed, particularly in edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
- **Final**: **False**

The program needs additional logic to handle cases where the MEX value is 0 and all elements are less than `mex`. The current implementation is incomplete and may fail in certain edge cases.
