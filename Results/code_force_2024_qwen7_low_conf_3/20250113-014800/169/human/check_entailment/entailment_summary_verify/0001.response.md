### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we will follow the steps outlined in the task and use the provided function summary to systematically analyze the program's behavior.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - Correct.

2. **Finding MEX**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array. It checks each integer starting from 0 until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - Correct.

3. **Segmentation Logic**:
   - If the MEX is 0, the array can trivially be split into two segments where each segment contains only 0, which has a MEX of 1.
     - **Issue**: The program prints `2 1 1 2 2` for the array `[0, 0]`, which is correct for the problem statement. However, the original assessment did not address the handling of the MEX being 0 properly. It should explicitly handle this case, but the logic seems to work fine in practice.
   - Otherwise, the program iterates through the array to find segments where the MEX is equal to the calculated MEX value.
     - **Issue**: The program uses a `num_set` to keep track of numbers encountered so far. When `num_set` contains all numbers up to the MEX, a new segment is started.
       - **Problem**: The logic here is flawed. The program only checks if `num_set` contains all numbers up to the MEX. However, it should ensure that the MEX of the current segment matches the expected MEX.
         - **Counterexample**: Consider the array `[0, 1, 7, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3]`. The MEX is 2. The program correctly identifies segments `[0, 1, 7]`, `[1, 0]`, and `[1, 0, 3]`, but it fails to check if the MEX of these segments is indeed 2.
     - **Issue**: If at the end, there are still numbers left in `num_set`, they are added to the last segment.
       - **Problem**: This part of the logic seems to work correctly, but the overall segmentation logic is flawed due to the previous issue.
     - **Issue**: Segments are stored in a list and printed accordingly.
       - **Problem**: As mentioned, the segmentation logic itself is flawed.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If no valid segmentation exists, `-1` is printed.
     - **Correct**.
   - Otherwise, the number of segments and their boundaries are printed.
     - **Correct**, but the segmentation logic is flawed.

Given the detailed analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required segmentation logic. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the MEX of each segment matches the expected MEX.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed segmentation logic. While it may pass some test cases, it does not guarantee correct behavior for all inputs.
