The function `func_1` takes no parameters but reads three lists (`n`, `k`, and `v`) and a list (`x`) from standard input. It then calculates the sum of elements in `v` for each absolute position specified by `x`. If at any point the power (`my_power`) is less than the calculated sum for a given position, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it continues reducing `my_power` by these sums and adding `k` to `my_power` at each step. If it completes the loop without finding a case where `my_power` is insufficient, it prints 'YES'. The function returns `None` in both cases where it prints 'NO' or 'YES'.
