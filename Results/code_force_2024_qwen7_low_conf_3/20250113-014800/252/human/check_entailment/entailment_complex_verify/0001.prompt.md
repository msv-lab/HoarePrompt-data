You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters but reads three lists (`n`, `k`, and `v`) and a list (`x`) from standard input. It then calculates the sum of elements in `v` for each absolute position specified by `x`. If at any point the power (`my_power`) is less than the calculated sum for a given position, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it continues reducing `my_power` by these sums and adding `k` to `my_power` at each step. If it completes the loop without finding a case where `my_power` is insufficient, it prints 'YES'. The function returns `None` in both cases where it prints 'NO' or 'YES'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by two lists of \( n \) integers \( a_i \) and \( x_i \). The function calls another function `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `func_1` has been called \( t \) times, where \( t \) is the number of test cases. The function does not provide any output or return any results; it only processes the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position (point 0) using the given constraints on bullets per second and monster health and positions.
2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function reads input values for \( n \) (number of monsters), \( k \) (bullets per second), and lists of monster healths and positions.
   - It initializes an array `put_all_on_right` to store the total health of monsters that would be positioned to the right of the current index if all were moved to the right.
   - For each position from 1 to \( n \), it updates `my_power` to reflect the number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters at or to the right of that position.
   - If at any point the player's power (`my_power`) is insufficient to defeat the monsters at a particular position, the function prints 'NO' and returns.
   - Otherwise, it continues to update the power and checks the next position until all positions are checked, at which point it prints 'YES'.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly calculates the total health of monsters that need to be defeated from the current position to the end.
   - It ensures that the player's power is sufficient to handle all monsters before any of them reach the player.
   - The algorithm iterates through each position and updates the player's power accordingly.

4. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive based on the given constraints.
   - The function `func_2` properly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

Based on the analysis, the provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described.
