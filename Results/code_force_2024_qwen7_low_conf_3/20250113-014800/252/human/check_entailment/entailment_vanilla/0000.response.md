Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position (point 0) using the given constraints on bullets per second and monster health and positions.
2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function reads input values for \( n \) (number of monsters), \( k \) (bullets per second), and lists of monster healths and positions.
   - It initializes an array `put_all_on_right` to store the total health of monsters that would be positioned to the right of the current index if all were moved to the right.
   - For each position from 1 to \( n \), it updates `my_power` to reflect the number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters at or to the right of that position.
   - If at any point the player's power (`my_power`) is insufficient to defeat the monsters at a particular position, the function prints 'NO' and returns.
   - Otherwise, it continues to update the power and checks the next position until all positions are checked, at which point it prints 'YES'.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly calculates the total health of monsters that need to be defeated from the current position to the end.
   - It ensures that the player's power is sufficient to handle all monsters before any of them reach the player.
   - The algorithm iterates through each position and updates the player's power accordingly.

4. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive based on the given constraints.
   - The function `func_2` properly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

Based on the analysis, the provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
