Reasoning:
- The problem involves determining if a player can survive and defeat all monsters in a game scenario.
- The provided solution uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` calculates the required power to survive for each test case and determines if the player can kill all monsters without getting killed.
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.
- Both functions follow the problem's constraints and logic accurately.
- The state transitions and operations within each function are consistent with the problem statement.
- The output matches the expected behavior for each test case provided in the example.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
