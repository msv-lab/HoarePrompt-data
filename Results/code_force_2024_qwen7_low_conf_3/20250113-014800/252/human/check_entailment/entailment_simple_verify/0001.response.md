### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position (point 0) using the given constraints on bullets per second and monster health and positions.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function reads input values for \( n \) (number of monsters), \( k \) (bullets per second), and lists of monster healths and positions.
   - It initializes an array `put_all_on_right` to store the total health of monsters that would be positioned to the right of the current index if all were moved to the right.
   - For each position from 1 to \( n \), it updates `my_power` to reflect the number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters at or to the right of that position.
   - If at any point the player's power (`my_power`) is insufficient to defeat the monsters at a particular position, the function prints 'NO' and returns.
   - Otherwise, it continues to update the power and checks the next position until all positions are checked, at which point it prints 'YES'.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly calculates the total health of monsters that need to be defeated from the current position to the end.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The function assumes that the player can always shoot all bullets at the monsters at the current position and then refill their power to \( k \) before moving on to the next position. This assumption is flawed because the movement of monsters is not taken into account when calculating `my_power`. Specifically, the function does not consider the possibility that some monsters might already be within range of the player before the player can shoot them.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     2 2
     1 2
     -1 1
     ```
     - In the first second, the player should shoot both monsters, reducing their health to 0. However, the player's power is updated to \( k - 1 - 2 = -1 \), which is incorrect. The player should have enough power to shoot both monsters and then refill to \( k \) power, but the function does not account for this correctly.

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the player can survive based on the given constraints. The critical flaw is that it does not take into account the movement of monsters and the timing of shooting and refilling power.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the movement of monsters and the timing of shooting and refilling power. Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
