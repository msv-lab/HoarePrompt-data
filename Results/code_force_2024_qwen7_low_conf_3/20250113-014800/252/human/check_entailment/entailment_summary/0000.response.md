Reasoning:
1. The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_2` is responsible for reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.
3. `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player's position.
   - It reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It then reads the health points (`v`) and positions (`x`) of the monsters.
   - It calculates the total health at each position on the line using `put_all_on_right`.
   - It iterates through these positions and checks if the player's remaining power (`my_power`) is sufficient to handle the total health at each position.
   - If at any point the player's power is insufficient, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without encountering an insufficient power situation, it prints 'YES'.

Given the descriptions and the execution summaries, the implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` aligns perfectly with the problem statement. The functions correctly process the input and produce the expected output based on the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
