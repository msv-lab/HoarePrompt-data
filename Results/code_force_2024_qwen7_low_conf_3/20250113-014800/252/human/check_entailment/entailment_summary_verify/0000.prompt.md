You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    put_all_on_right = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        put_all_on_right[abs(x[i])] += v[i]
    my_power = k
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if my_power < put_all_on_right[i]:
            print('NO')
            return
        my_power -= put_all_on_right[i]
        my_power += k
    print('YES')

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by two lists of \( n \) integers \( a_i \) and \( x_i \). The function calls another function `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `func_1` has been called \( t \) times, where \( t \) is the number of test cases. The function does not provide any output or return any results; it only processes the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement and shooting of monsters as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for checking whether the player can survive and kill all monsters is flawed.

Here’s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Movement Logic**: In the original problem, all monsters move towards the player after every second, and any monster that reaches the player's position (point 0) results in a loss. However, the provided program only checks the maximum number of monsters that can be on the right side of the player and does not simulate the continuous movement of all monsters.

2. **Incorrect Check**: The program calculates `put_all_on_right` which represents the total health of monsters at each distance from the player but does not correctly simulate the continuous movement and shooting process. It assumes that the player can handle the maximum health of monsters at any given distance simultaneously, which is not accurate.

3. **Example Counter-Case**: Consider a test case with \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \):
   ```
   2 2
   1 1
   -1 1
   ```

   - Initially, there are two monsters at positions -1 and 1 with health 1 each.
   - In the first second, the player can shoot both monsters, killing them both.
   - After the first second, no monsters remain, and the player wins.

However, the provided program would incorrectly return 'NO' because it does not correctly simulate the movement and shooting process. It only checks the initial distribution of monsters and does not account for the fact that the player can handle multiple monsters simultaneously as long as their combined health does not exceed the player's capacity \( k \).

Therefore, the program fails to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, making it incorrect.
