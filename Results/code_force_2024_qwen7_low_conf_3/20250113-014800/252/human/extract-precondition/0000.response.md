Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. Each test case consists of three lines where the first line contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^9. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**
