The code `my_power -= put_all_on_right[i]` subtracts the value of `put_all_on_right[i]` from `my_power`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `n` is a non-negative integer. The value of `my_power` is updated based on the subtraction.

To determine the new value of `my_power`, we need to know the value of `put_all_on_right[2]`. However, since this value is not specified, we will represent it as `put_all_on_right[2]`.

The new value of `my_power` will be:

\[ \text{new\_my\_power} = \text{my\_power} - \text{put\_all\_on\_right}[2] \]

Since the initial value of `my_power` is the original value minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k`, and `n` remains unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` is the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k` minus `put_all_on_right[2]`.**
