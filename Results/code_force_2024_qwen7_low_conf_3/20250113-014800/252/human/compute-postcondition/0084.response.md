The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `bullets` is `k * (2 * last_pos - 2 * a[i])`, `last_pos` is `x[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0**
