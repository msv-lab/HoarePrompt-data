`func_1()` is called once. Since `func_1()` has already been called three times in the initial state, calling it one more time means it has been called four times in total. The value of `t` remains unchanged because the function call does not modify `t`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `func_1()` has been called four times**
