`bullets` is assigned the value of `bullets - a[i]`. The previous value of `bullets` is `k * (3 * x[i] - last_pos - 2 * a[i])`, and `x[i]` is equal to `last_pos`. Therefore, the new value of `bullets` is `k * (3 * last_pos - last_pos - 2 * a[i])`, which simplifies to `k * (2 * last_pos - 2 * a[i])`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `bullets` is `k * (2 * last_pos - 2 * a[i])`, `last_pos` is `x[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0**
