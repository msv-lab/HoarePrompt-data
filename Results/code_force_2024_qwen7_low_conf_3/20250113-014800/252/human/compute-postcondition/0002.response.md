The function `func_1()` is called, but the specific implementation of `func_1()` is not provided. Since no changes to the variables are made within the given code snippet, the only affected part is the function call itself. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called**
