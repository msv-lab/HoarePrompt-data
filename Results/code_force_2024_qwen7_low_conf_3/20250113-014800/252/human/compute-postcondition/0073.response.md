`bullets` is updated by adding `k * (x[i] - last_pos)` to its current value. Given that `bullets` is initially `k * (x[i] - 0) - a[i]`, the new value of `bullets` will be `k * (x[i] - 0) - a[i] + k * (x[i] - last_pos)`. Simplifying this, we get `bullets` as `k * (x[i] - 0 + x[i] - last_pos) - a[i]`, which simplifies further to `bullets` as `k * (2 * x[i] - last_pos - 0) - a[i]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `bullets` is `k * (2 * x[i] - last_pos) - a[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input, `last_pos` is `x[m]`.**
