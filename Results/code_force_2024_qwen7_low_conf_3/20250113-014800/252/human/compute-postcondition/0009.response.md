Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by two lists of \( n \) integers \( a_i \) and \( x_i \). The function calls another function `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `func_1` has been called \( t \) times, where \( t \) is the number of test cases. The function does not provide any output or return any results; it only processes the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If the input values for \( n \) or \( k \) do not satisfy the given constraints (e.g., \( n > 3 \times 10^5 \), \( k > 2 \times 10^9 \)), the function will raise an error due to invalid input.
- If the input for \( x_i \) does not strictly increase and is not within the specified range, the function will also raise an error.
- If the input for \( t \) is zero, the function will not execute the loop, resulting in no calls to `func_1`.

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not process or use the values returned by `func_1` after calling it for each test case.
- There is no handling for invalid input types (e.g., non-integer values for \( n \), \( k \), \( a_i \), or \( x_i \)).
