The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter, which is implied to be a list of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines:
1. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
2. The second line contains `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
3. The third line contains `n` integers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(-n \leq x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq 0\).

Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

The function returns a result based on the processing of each test case, but the specific output is not detailed here.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of test cases, each containing `n`, `k`, a list of `n` integers `a_i`, and a list of `n` integers `x_i`, and return a result based on the processing of these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing integers n and k, followed by two lists of n integers a_i and x_i, and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
