`bullets` is incremented by `k * (x[i] - last_pos)`. The initial value of `bullets` is `k * (2 * x[i] - last_pos) - 2 * a[i]`. After adding `k * (x[i] - last_pos)` to `bullets`, the new value of `bullets` becomes `k * (2 * x[i] - last_pos) - 2 * a[i] + k * (x[i] - last_pos)`, which simplifies to `k * (3 * x[i] - last_pos - 2 * a[i])`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, `last_pos`, and `a`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `bullets` is `k * (3 * x[i] - last_pos - 2 * a[i])`, `n` must be greater than 0**
