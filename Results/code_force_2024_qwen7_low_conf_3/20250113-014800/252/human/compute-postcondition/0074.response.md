The code updates the value of `last_pos` to be equal to `x[i]`. The initial value of `last_pos` was `x[m]`. Therefore, `last_pos` now holds the value of `x[i]`.

Since no other variables are directly affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `bullets` is `k * (2 * x[i] - last_pos) - a[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input, `last_pos` is `x[i]`.**
