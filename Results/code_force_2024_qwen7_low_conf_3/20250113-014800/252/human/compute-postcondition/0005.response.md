According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop runs for `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, and `func_1()` has been called twice.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 2 because it starts from 0 and is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1, making it greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `func_1()` has been called three times**
