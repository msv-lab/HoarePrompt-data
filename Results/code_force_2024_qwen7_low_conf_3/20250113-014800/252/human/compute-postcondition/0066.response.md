`last_pos` is assigned the value of `x[i]`. The value of `i` is known to be `m`, and `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes `last_pos` being set to `x[m]`.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `bullets` is `k * (x[i] - 0)`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input, `last_pos` is `x[m]`**
