The code snippet `print('NO')` does not affect any variables. It only prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `my_power` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` is the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k`.**
