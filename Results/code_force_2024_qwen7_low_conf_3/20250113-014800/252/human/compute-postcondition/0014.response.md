The code `print('NO')` does not change any variable values; it only prints 'NO'. Therefore, the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `my_power` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` is less than `put_all_on_right[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.**
