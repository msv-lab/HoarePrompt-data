Postcondition: ***`i` is `m + 1`, `bullets` is `k * (2 * x[i] - last_pos) - 2 * a[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input, `last_pos` is `x[i]`. If `bullets < 0`, the console prints 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables.***
