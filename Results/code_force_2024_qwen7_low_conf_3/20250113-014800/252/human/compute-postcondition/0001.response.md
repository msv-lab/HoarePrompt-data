According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1 because the `range(t)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
