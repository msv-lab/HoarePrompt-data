`my_power` is decremented by the value of `put_all_on_right[i]`. Since `i` is initially 1, `put_all_on_right[i]` refers to the second element in the list `put_all_on_right`. The condition `my_power >= put_all_on_right[i]` being true ensures that the subtraction operation will not result in `my_power` becoming less than `put_all_on_right[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` is decreased by `put_all_on_right[1]`**
