Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` is the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k`. If `my_power` is less than `put_all_on_right[i]`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (implying the same state as the postcondition of the if part).***
