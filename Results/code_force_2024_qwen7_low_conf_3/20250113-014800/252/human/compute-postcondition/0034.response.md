Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes no parameters but reads three lists (`n`, `k`, and `v`) and a list (`x`) from standard input. It then calculates the sum of elements in `v` for each absolute position specified by `x`. If at any point the power (`my_power`) is less than the calculated sum for a given position, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it continues reducing `my_power` by these sums and adding `k` to `my_power` at each step. If it completes the loop without finding a case where `my_power` is insufficient, it prints 'YES'. The function returns `None` in both cases where it prints 'NO' or 'YES'.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the condition where `my_power` might become negative during the iterations, leading to a 'NO' output.
- There are no explicit checks for invalid input types or values, such as non-integer inputs for `n` and `k`, or out-of-range values for elements in `v` and `x`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- The function assumes valid input formats and does not handle cases where `n` or `k` are zero, which would trivialize the problem since the loops would not execute.
- The function does not validate that the elements of `x` satisfy the constraints `-n ≤ x[i] < x[i + 1] ≤ n` and `x[i] ≠ 0`. If these constraints are violated, the results may be incorrect or the function might raise an exception.
