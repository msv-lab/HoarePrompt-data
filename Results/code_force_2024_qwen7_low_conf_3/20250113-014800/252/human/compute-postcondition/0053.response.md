`bullets` is assigned the value `k \times x[0] - 2 \times a[2] + k \times (x[3] - x[1])`. The value of `i` is 3, so `a[i]` is `a[3]`. The code subtracts `a[3]` from `bullets`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `bullets` is `k \times x[0] - 2 \times a[2] + k \times (x[3] - x[1]) - a[3]`, `last_pos` is `x[3]`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input**
