Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `bullets` is `k * x[0] - a[i]`, `last_pos` is `x[1]`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input. If the current value of `bullets` is less than 0, the string 'NO' is printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
