Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^9\), `x` is a list of integers where \(-n \leq x[i] < x[i+1] \leq n\) for each \(0 \leq i < n-1\) and \(x[i] \neq 0\), `put_all_on_right` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the sum of `v[i]` for all `i` such that \(|x[i]| = j\) for \(0 \leq j \leq n\)**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `x` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each index `i`, the value `put_all_on_right[abs(x[i])]` is updated by adding `v[i]` to its current value.
- After the loop completes, the final state of `put_all_on_right` will be such that each element `put_all_on_right[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq n\)) will contain the sum of all `v[i]` where `|x[i]| = j`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), then:
- `put_all_on_right` remains as a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initially set to 0.
