Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` remains as the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k` minus `put_all_on_right[2]` plus `k`. If `my_power` is less than `put_all_on_right[i]`, the condition is met without any additional changes. Otherwise, no specific changes are mentioned for the `if-else` block, so the values remain as they were after evaluating the condition.***
