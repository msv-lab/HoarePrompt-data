The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it relies on global variables `n`, `k`, `v`, and `x`, which are not defined within the function body but are expected to be defined in the scope where the function is called.

- If a certain condition is not met (indicated by Case_1), the function returns "NO".
- If another set of conditions is met, the function returns `None`.
- In all other cases, the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to check specific conditions using the global variables `n`, `k`, `v`, and `x`, and based on these checks, return either "NO" or `None`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns "NO" under certain conditions, otherwise returns `None`.**
