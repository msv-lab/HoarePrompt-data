Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is 2
  - `n` is a non-negative integer
  - `my_power` is the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k` minus `put_all_on_right[2]` plus `k`

- The for loop is defined as:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
2. **Current Iteration**: The loop has just completed its 2nd iteration (since `i` is currently 2).
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `i` needs to be incremented to 3, the new state of `i` will be 3.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is a constant determined before the loop starts.
- `my_power` is not directly modified by the loop but rather depends on the initial values and the expressions involving `put_all_on_right[1]`, `put_all_on_right[2]`, and `k`.

### Final State:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is a non-negative integer (unchanged)
- `my_power` remains as the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k` minus `put_all_on_right[2]` plus `k`

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` remains as the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k` minus `put_all_on_right[2]` plus `k`**
