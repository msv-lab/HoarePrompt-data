Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `bullets` is \( k \times x[0] - 2 \times a[2] + k \times (x[2] - x[1]) \), `last_pos` is `x[2]`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input. If `bullets` is less than 0, then the function does not change the values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `bullets`, `last_pos`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.***
