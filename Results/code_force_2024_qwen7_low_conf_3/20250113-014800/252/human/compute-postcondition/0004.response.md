The code `func_1()` is called again, but the exact impact of `func_1()` on the variables is not specified in the initial state or the code snippet provided. Therefore, the only changes are that `func_1()` has been called twice, and the condition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called twice**
