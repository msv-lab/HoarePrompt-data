The code `last_pos = x[i]` assigns the value of `x[i]` to the variable `last_pos`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of `last_pos` will be `x[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `bullets` is `k * x[0]`, `last_pos` is `x[1]`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input**
