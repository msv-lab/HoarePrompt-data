Output State: **`i` is `n`, `bullets` is the sum of `k * (x[j] - last_pos)` for each `j` in range `n` minus the sum of `a[j]` for each `j` in range `n`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on user input, `x` is a sorted list of absolute integers based on user input, `last_pos` is `x[n-1]`. If `bullets` is non-negative after completing all iterations, the console prints 'YES'. If `bullets` is negative at any point during the loop, the console prints 'NO' and the loop breaks.**
