According to the code, the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` should be less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `my_power` is the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i = 2`.
- For the loop to continue, `n` must remain a non-negative integer, and `i` (now 2) must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `my_power` remains as the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k`

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` is the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `k`**
