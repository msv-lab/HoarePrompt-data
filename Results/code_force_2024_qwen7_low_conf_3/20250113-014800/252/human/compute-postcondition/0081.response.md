The code sets `last_pos` to the value of `x[i]`. The value of `x[i]` is the same as the value of `last_pos` after this line of code runs. The other variables (`i`, `bullets`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `bullets` is `k * (3 * x[i] - last_pos - 2 * a[i])`, `last_pos` is `x[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0**
