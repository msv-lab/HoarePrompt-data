The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is the printed output.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `my_power` is the original value of `my_power` plus `k` times `n` minus the sum of `put_all_on_right[i]` for all `i` in the range `[1, n]`, and the console prints 'YES'**
