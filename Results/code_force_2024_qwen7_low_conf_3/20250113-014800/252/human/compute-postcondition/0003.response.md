According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop runs `t` times, and if `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 (since it has already executed once). Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called**
