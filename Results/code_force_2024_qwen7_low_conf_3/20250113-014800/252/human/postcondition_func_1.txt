The function `func_2` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by two lists of \( n \) integers \( a_i \) and \( x_i \). The function calls another function `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `func_1` has been called \( t \) times, where \( t \) is the number of test cases. The function does not provide any output or return any results; it only processes the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.
