Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, we need to check if the functions `func_1` and `func_2` behave as expected and produce the correct output.

1. **func_2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2` is designed to simulate the process of cutting the paper and checking if the area becomes strictly less than `k`.
   - It initializes `h` and `w` to `n` and `m`, respectively.
   - It iteratively halves the larger dimension (`h` or `w`) until either the product `h * w` becomes less than `k` or it has performed the specified number of steps.
   - The function returns `True` if the area becomes less than `k` within the specified number of steps or at the end of the iterations, and `False` otherwise.
   - This function seems to correctly implement the logic for determining if the area will become less than `k` after a certain number of steps.

2. **func_1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes `t` test cases, and computes a result for each test case.
   - It uses a binary search approach to find the minimum number of steps required for the area to become strictly less than `k`.
   - The search range is set to `(0, max(n, m) * 20)`, which appears to be a reasonable upper bound given the constraints.
   - The binary search is performed efficiently, updating the `low` and `high` bounds until the exact number of steps is found.
   - Once the minimum number of steps `answer` is found, it calculates the result using modular arithmetic and appends it to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The binary search and the calculation of the modular inverse appear to be implemented correctly according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis above, both functions seem to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The binary search in `func_1` finds the minimum number of steps required, and `func_2` correctly checks if the area becomes less than `k` after a given number of steps.

Correctness: **True**
