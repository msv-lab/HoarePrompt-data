Reasoning:
1. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_1` reads input from stdin, processes `t` test cases, and computes a result for each test case based on given integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. `func_1` uses a binary search to find the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`.
4. `func_2` simulates cutting the paper and checks if the area is less than `k` after a certain number of steps.
5. The overall logic of `func_1` seems to correctly implement the problem statement:
   - It reads input, processes each test case, and performs a binary search to find the minimum number of steps required.
   - It then calculates the result using modular arithmetic.
6. The provided code handles the constraints and potential edge cases appropriately.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the problem statement and the given logic seems sound.

Correctness: **True**
