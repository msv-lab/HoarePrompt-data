Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet of paper strictly less than `k`. 

In `func_2`, the logic for reducing the dimensions of the paper (`h` and `w`) is flawed. Instead of simulating random cuts along the lines `x = 1, 2, ..., w-1` and `y = 1, 2, ..., h-1`, the function incorrectly reduces the dimensions by half at each step, which does not reflect the randomness required by the problem statement. 

For example, consider the test case `2 4 8`. The correct approach would involve simulating random cuts, but the current implementation simply reduces the dimensions by half until the area is less than `k`, which is not a valid representation of the randomness required.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate random cuts, keeping track of the number of steps taken, and ensuring that the final area is strictly less than `k`.
