You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a rectangular sheet of paper with initial height n and width m . Let
the current height and width be h and w respectively. We introduce a xy
-coordinate system so that the four corners of the sheet are (0, 0), (w, 0),
(0, h) , and (w, h) . The sheet can then be cut along the lines x =
1,2,\ldots,w-1 and the lines y = 1,2,\ldots,h-1 . In each step, the paper is
cut randomly along any one of these h+w-2 lines. After each vertical and
horizontal cut, the right and bottom piece of paper respectively are
discarded.

Find the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet of
paper strictly less than k . It can be shown that this answer can always be
expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are coprime integers.
Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 57000 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m , and k (1 \le n, m
\le 10^6 , 2 \le k \le 10^{12} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not
exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer â€” the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 4 10
    
    2 4 8
    
    2 4 2
    
    2 4 6

Output

    0
    1
    833333342
    250000003
    
Note

For the first test case, the area is already less than 10 so no cuts are
required.

For the second test case, the area is exactly 8 so any one of the 4 possible
cuts would make the area strictly less than 8 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{17}{6} = 833\,333\,342\bmod
(10^9+7) .

For the fourth test case, the final answer is \frac{5}{4} = 250\,000\,003\bmod
(10^9+7) .
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    MOD = 1000000007
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        m = int(data[idx + 1])
        k = int(data[idx + 2])
        idx += 3
        (low, high) = (0, max(n, m) * 20)
        answer = high
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if func_2(n, m, k, mid):
                answer = mid
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        p = answer
        q = 1
        q_inv = pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)
        result = p * q_inv % MOD
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m, k, steps):
    import math
    (h, w) = (n, m)
    for _ in range(steps):
        if h > w:
            h = max(h // 2, 1)
        else:
            w = max(w // 2, 1)
        if h * w < k:
            return True
    return h * w < k


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
