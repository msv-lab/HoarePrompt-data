Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes it accordingly. The number of test cases `t` is read first, followed by the dimensions `n`, `m`, and the threshold `k` for each test case. This matches the problem's requirement for reading multiple test cases.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary search approach to find the minimum number of steps (`answer`) required to reduce the area of the sheet to less than `k`. The search range is from `0` to `max(n, m) * 20`, which is a reasonable upper bound considering the constraints.
   - For each step `mid` in the binary search, `func_2` is called to check if the area of the sheet can be reduced to less than `k` in `mid` steps.
   - The function `func_2` simulates the cutting process by repeatedly halving the larger dimension until the area is less than `k`.

3. **Area Calculation and Modulo Operation**:
   - Once the minimum number of steps `answer` is found, the program calculates `p` (which is `answer` in this context) and `q` (which is `1` in this context).
   - The modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is calculated as `q_inv`, which is `1` because \(1\) raised to the power of \((10^9 + 7) - 2\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is still `1`.
   - The result `p * q_inv % MOD` is computed and stored in the `results` list, which is printed at the end of the loop.

4. **Handling Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints appropriately, ensuring that the input sizes and operations do not exceed the specified limits.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the final result is within the required bounds.

### Summary:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet strictly less than `k`, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
