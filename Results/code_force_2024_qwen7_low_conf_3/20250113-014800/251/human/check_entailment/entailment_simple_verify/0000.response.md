### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine the accuracy of the original assessment.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Purpose**: This function is supposed to simulate the process of cutting the paper until its area is strictly less than `k`.
2. **Behavior**: The function currently reduces the dimensions of the paper by half at each step. However, it does not simulate random cuts as required by the problem statement. Instead, it uses a deterministic approach to halve the dimensions, which is not correct.
3. **Expected Behavior**: To accurately simulate the process, we need to generate random cuts along the lines `x = 1, 2, ..., w-1` and `y = 1, 2, ..., h-1` and keep track of the number of steps taken.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Purpose**: This function reads the input, performs binary search to find the minimum number of steps required, and calculates the final result using modular inverse.
2. **Behavior**: The function reads the input correctly and performs binary search to find the minimum number of steps. However, the `func_2` function used in the binary search is incorrect.
3. **Expected Behavior**: The `func_2` function should simulate random cuts, not deterministic halving of dimensions.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem because the `func_2` function is flawed and does not simulate random cuts as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not accurately simulate the process of making random cuts to reduce the area of the paper until it is strictly less than `k`.
