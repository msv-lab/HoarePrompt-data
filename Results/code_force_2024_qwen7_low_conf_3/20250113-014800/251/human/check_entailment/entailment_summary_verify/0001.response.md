### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Input Handling and Preprocessing**:
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes it accordingly.
   - It correctly handles the modulo operation and the binary search logic to find the minimum number of steps required.

2. **Binary Search Implementation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the minimum number of steps required such that the area of the paper is strictly less than \(k\).
   - It uses the helper function `func_2` to check if a given number of steps will make the area less than \(k\).

3. **Helper Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` simulates the process of cutting the paper and checks if after the specified number of steps, the area of the paper is less than \(k\).
   - It correctly updates the dimensions of the paper by halving them until the area is less than \(k\) or the maximum allowed cuts have been made.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program correctly computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), where \(q = 1\) (since the answer is always an integer in this context).

### Detailed Analysis Based on Function Summary:

- **Function Summary**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly simulates the process of cutting the paper and checks if the area is less than \(k\).
  - The function returns `True` if the area becomes less than \(k\) within the specified number of steps, or if specific conditions related to the halving of dimensions are met.

- **Binary Search Logic**:
  - The binary search in `func_1` is correctly implemented to find the minimum number of steps required. The search space is defined between 0 and `max(n, m) * 20`, which is a reasonable upper bound for practical purposes.
  - The binary search logic updates the lower and upper bounds appropriately and calls `func_2` to check if the current midpoint value satisfies the condition.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles edge cases where the initial area is already less than \(k\), returning 0 as expected.
  - The function also handles cases where the area does not become less than \(k\) even after the maximum number of cuts, returning the maximum number of cuts.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Binary Search**:
  - The binary search in `func_1` correctly narrows down the number of steps required to make the area less than \(k\).
  - The use of `func_2` to verify the number of steps ensures that the binary search is accurate.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly simulates the cutting process and checks if the area becomes less than \(k\).
  - The logic of halving the dimensions until the area is less than \(k\) or the maximum number of cuts is reached is sound.

- **Modular Arithmetic**:
  - The computation of \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is handled correctly, although \(q = 1\) simplifies the modular inverse to 1, making the computation trivial.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The binary search approach ensures that the number of steps is minimized, and the helper function accurately simulates the cutting process.

### Final Evaluation:
