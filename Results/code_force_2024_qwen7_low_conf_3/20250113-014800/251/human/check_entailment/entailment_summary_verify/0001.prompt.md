You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a rectangular sheet of paper with initial height n and width m . Let
the current height and width be h and w respectively. We introduce a xy
-coordinate system so that the four corners of the sheet are (0, 0), (w, 0),
(0, h) , and (w, h) . The sheet can then be cut along the lines x =
1,2,\ldots,w-1 and the lines y = 1,2,\ldots,h-1 . In each step, the paper is
cut randomly along any one of these h+w-2 lines. After each vertical and
horizontal cut, the right and bottom piece of paper respectively are
discarded.

Find the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet of
paper strictly less than k . It can be shown that this answer can always be
expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are coprime integers.
Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 57000 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m , and k (1 \le n, m
\le 10^6 , 2 \le k \le 10^{12} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not
exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 4 10
    
    2 4 8
    
    2 4 2
    
    2 4 6

Output

    0
    1
    833333342
    250000003
    
Note

For the first test case, the area is already less than 10 so no cuts are
required.

For the second test case, the area is exactly 8 so any one of the 4 possible
cuts would make the area strictly less than 8 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{17}{6} = 833\,333\,342\bmod
(10^9+7) .

For the fourth test case, the final answer is \frac{5}{4} = 250\,000\,003\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    MOD = 1000000007
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        m = int(data[idx + 1])
        k = int(data[idx + 2])
        idx += 3
        (low, high) = (0, max(n, m) * 20)
        answer = high
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if func_2(n, m, k, mid):
                answer = mid
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        p = answer
        q = 1
        q_inv = pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)
        result = p * q_inv % MOD
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m, k, steps):
    import math
    (h, w) = (n, m)
    for _ in range(steps):
        if h > w:
            h = max(h // 2, 1)
        else:
            w = max(w // 2, 1)
        if h * w < k:
            return True
    return h * w < k



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`. It initializes `h` and `w` to the values of `n` and `m`, respectively. The function then enters a loop that iterates up to `steps` times, halving either `h` or `w` (whichever is larger) in each iteration, ensuring that both `h` and `w` remain at least 1. After the loop, the function checks if the product of `h` and `w` is less than `k`.

If the loop completes without the product of `h` and `w` being less than `k`, the function returns `False`. However, due to the postconditions provided, there are three cases where the function returns `True`:

1. If `h > w` and `h` is halved in the first iteration.
2. If `w > h` and `w` is halved in the first iteration.
3. If `h * w` becomes less than `k` during the loop.

Therefore, the function returns `True` if any of the first three cases occur or if the product of `h` and `w` is less than `k` after the loop. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `False`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Input Handling and Preprocessing**:
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes it accordingly.
   - It correctly handles the modulo operation and the binary search logic to find the minimum number of steps required.

2. **Binary Search Implementation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the minimum number of steps required such that the area of the paper is strictly less than \(k\).
   - It uses the helper function `func_2` to check if a given number of steps will make the area less than \(k\).

3. **Helper Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` simulates the process of cutting the paper and checks if after the specified number of steps, the area of the paper is less than \(k\).
   - It correctly updates the dimensions of the paper by halving them until the area is less than \(k\) or the maximum allowed cuts have been made.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program correctly computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), where \(q = 1\) (since the answer is always an integer in this context).

### Verification:
Given the provided example cases and the problem description, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The binary search approach ensures that the number of steps is minimized, and the helper function accurately simulates the cutting process.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
