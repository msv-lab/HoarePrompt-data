### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Input Handling and Preprocessing**:
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes it accordingly.
   - It correctly handles the modulo operation and the binary search logic to find the minimum number of steps required.

2. **Binary Search Implementation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the minimum number of steps required such that the area of the paper is strictly less than \(k\).
   - It uses the helper function `func_2` to check if a given number of steps will make the area less than \(k\).

3. **Helper Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` simulates the process of cutting the paper and checks if after the specified number of steps, the area of the paper is less than \(k\).
   - It correctly updates the dimensions of the paper by halving them until the area is less than \(k\) or the maximum allowed cuts have been made.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program correctly computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), where \(q = 1\) (since the answer is always an integer in this context).

### Verification:
Given the provided example cases and the problem description, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The binary search approach ensures that the number of steps is minimized, and the helper function accurately simulates the cutting process.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
