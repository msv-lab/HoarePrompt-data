To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop continues. The loop condition is `low <= high`.

Let's break down the postconditions given and see how they relate to the loop continuation:

1. **Postconditions from the previous iteration:**
   - \( t \) is \( t - 1 \)
   - \( n \) is the integer value of \( data[idx] \)
   - \( m \) is the integer value of \( data[idx + 1] \)
   - \( idx \) is increased by 6
   - \( low \) and \( high \) are updated based on the return value of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`
   - \( answer \) is either \( \max(n, m) \) or \( 2 \times \max(n, m) \)
   - \( p \) is equal to the final value of \( answer \)
   - \( q \) is 1
   - \( q_inv \) is 1
   - \( result \) is \( (2 \times \max(n, m)) \% MOD \)
   - \( results \) is a list containing one element which is \( (2 \times \max(n, m)) \% MOD \)
   - \( k \) is the integer value of \( data[idx + 2] \)

2. **Conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as \( low \leq high \).

Given the postconditions, let's focus on the values of `low` and `high`:

- After the previous iteration, `low` and `high` were updated based on the return value of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`.
- The function `func_2` returns a boolean value, which updates `low` and `high` accordingly.

The key here is that the loop will continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`**
