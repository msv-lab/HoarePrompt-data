Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes `t` test cases, and computes a result for each test case based on given integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`. It then calculates a result using modular arithmetic and appends it to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result. Potential edge cases include the input constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 57000, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}) and the condition that the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The function also includes a missing annotation for the `func_2` function call, which should be described as performing some boolean check based on the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `mid`.**

**After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows:**
- `results` is a list containing the computed results for each of the `t` test cases.
- Each result in the `results` list is the smallest integer `x` (computed through the binary search) modulo `MOD`.
- The program has printed each result from the `results` list.
- No other variables are modified beyond their use in the computation and printing process.
