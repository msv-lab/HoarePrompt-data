Postcondition: **`low` and `high` are unchanged or adjusted based on the outcome of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`. If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, then `high` is set to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `answer` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` remains unchanged.**
