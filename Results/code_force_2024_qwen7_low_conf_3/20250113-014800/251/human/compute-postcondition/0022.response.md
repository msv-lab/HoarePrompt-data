Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), `h` and `w` are each halved (but at least one remains as 1 if it becomes 0.5 or less) until `h * w < k` or the loop reaches its maximum number of steps, `steps` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `h * w` is greater than or equal to `k` unless the function returns True.**
