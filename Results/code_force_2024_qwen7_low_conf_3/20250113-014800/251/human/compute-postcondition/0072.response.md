The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `result` is equal to `p`, and the only element in `results` before this operation is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`.

- `result` remains `p`.
- `results` now contains two elements: `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are final values based on the binary search process, `answer` is the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the modular inverse of `1` modulo `MOD`, `result` is `p`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.
