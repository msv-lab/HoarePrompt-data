`low` is reassigned to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The values of `high` and `mid` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
