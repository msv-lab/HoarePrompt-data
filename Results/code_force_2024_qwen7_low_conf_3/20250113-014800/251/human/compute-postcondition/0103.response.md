The code snippet calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)`. This changes the value of `q_inv` from its initial value of 1 to the modular inverse of `q` modulo `MOD`.

- `q_inv` is updated to the modular inverse of `q` modulo `MOD`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \( t - 1 \); `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is the original value plus 3; `p` is `answer`; `q` is 1; `q_inv` is the modular inverse of `q` modulo `MOD`; `result` is `answer`; `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`; `results` is a list containing \((2 \times \max(n, m)) \% \text{MOD}\) and `answer`; `low` and `high` are equal and represent the value of `answer`; `answer` is the value that satisfies `func_2(n, m, k, answer)`**
