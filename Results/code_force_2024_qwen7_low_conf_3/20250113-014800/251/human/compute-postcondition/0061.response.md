Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The loop condition is `low <= high`. This means the loop will continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
   - Depending on the result of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`, either `answer` is set to `mid` and `high` is updated to `(2 * low + high) // 2 - 1`, or `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must still hold true. We need to determine what changes are necessary to ensure this condition remains true.

4. **Analyzing Loop Exit Conditions**:
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, `answer` is set to `mid` and `high` is updated to `(2 * low + high) // 2 - 1`.
     - In this case, `low` remains the same, and `high` is reduced.
     - To ensure `low <= high` still holds, we need to ensure that `(2 * low + high) // 2 - 1` is still greater than or equal to `low`.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is false, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
     - In this case, `low` is increased, and `high` remains the same.
     - To ensure `low <= high` still holds, we need to ensure that `(low + high) // 2 + 1` is still less than or equal to `high`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` are such that `low <= high` still holds true.
   - Since the only change in `low` or `high` occurs inside the loop, we need to ensure that after the update, the condition `low <= high` is maintained.

Given the conditions:
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, the new `high` will be `(2 * low + high) // 2 - 1`. We need to ensure this is still greater than or equal to `low`.
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is false, the new `low` will be `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. We need to ensure this is still less than or equal to `high`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `low <= high` and consider the worst-case scenario where `low` is increased or `high` is decreased.

**State Adjustment**:
- We need to ensure that `low` and `high` are such that the loop condition `low <= high` still holds.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment should be:
State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`**
