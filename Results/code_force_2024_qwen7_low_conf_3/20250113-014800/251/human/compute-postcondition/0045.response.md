The code updates the values of `low` and `high`. The initial values of `n` and `m` are taken into account to determine these new values. Specifically, `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to twice the maximum of `n` and `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`
- `idx` is increased by 6
- `low` is the final value determined by the loop (initially unknown, but now set)
- `high` is the final value determined by the loop (initially unknown, but now set)
- `answer` is the final value of `mid` calculated as `(low + high) // 2`
- `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`
- `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`
- `q` is 1
- `q_inv` is 1
- `result` is `answer % MOD`
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`

After executing the code:
- `low` is set to `0`
- `high` is set to `2 * max(n, m)`

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` is 0, `high` is 2 * max(n, m), `answer` is the final value of `mid` calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`**
