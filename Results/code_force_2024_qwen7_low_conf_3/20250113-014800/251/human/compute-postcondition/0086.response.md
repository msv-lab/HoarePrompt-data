The code changes the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, the new value of `low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is the original value plus 3, `low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, and `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is `False`**
