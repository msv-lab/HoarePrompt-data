Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^12, `h` and `w` are either halved (but at least one remains as 1 if it becomes 0.5 or less) or the maximum of half and 1, `steps` is greater than 0, and the product of `h` and `w` is less than `k`.***
