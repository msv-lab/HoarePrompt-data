The code `answer = mid` assigns the current value of `mid` to `answer`. The variables `low`, `high`, and `mid` are not directly affected by this line of code, except that `mid` was previously updated to `(low + high) // 2`. Therefore, the value of `answer` is now the same as the value of `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` and `high` are unchanged or adjusted based on the outcome of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` ensuring that `low <= high` holds true; `mid` is updated to (low + high) // 2; `answer` is (low + high) // 2**
