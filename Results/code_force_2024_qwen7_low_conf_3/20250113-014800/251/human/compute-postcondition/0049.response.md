Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` is 0, `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `answer` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `mid` is `max(n, m)`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, and the function `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`**
