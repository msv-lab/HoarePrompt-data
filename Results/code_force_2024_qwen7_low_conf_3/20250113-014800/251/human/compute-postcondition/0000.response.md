The code assigns the values of `n` and `m` to `h` and `w` respectively. This means `h` is now `n` and `w` is now `m`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `steps` is still a non-negative integer representing the number of steps taken to reduce the area.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `h` is `n`, `w` is `m`, and `steps` is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps taken to reduce the area.**
