The code calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. Since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2**
