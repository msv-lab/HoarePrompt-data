The code calculates the midpoint `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`. Given the initial state, we can determine the values of `low` and `high`:

- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`

Therefore, `mid` is calculated as follows:
- `mid = (0 + max(n, m) * 20) // 2`

This simplifies to:
- `mid = max(n, m) * 10`

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is the original value plus 3, `low` is `0`, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`**
