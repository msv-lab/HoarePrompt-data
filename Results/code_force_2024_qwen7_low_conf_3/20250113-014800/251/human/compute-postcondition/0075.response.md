The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` to `m`. Since `data[idx + 1]` was initially the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, the value of `m` remains unchanged from its initial state. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are the same, `answer` is the same, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.**
