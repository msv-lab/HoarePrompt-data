The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Before this operation, `results` contains two elements: `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `answer`. 

Since `result` is defined as `p % MOD`, appending `result` to `results` means adding `p % MOD` to the existing list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here is the updated state:

- `t` is \( t - 1 \)
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`
- `idx` is the original value plus 3
- `p` is `answer`
- `q` is 1
- `q_inv` is 1
- `result` is `p % MOD`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`
- `results` is a list containing `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `answer`, and `p % MOD`
- `low` and `high` are equal and represent the value of `answer`
- `answer` is the value that satisfies `func_2(n, m, k, answer)`

Output State: **`t` is \( t - 1 \); `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is the original value plus 3; `p` is `answer`; `q` is 1; `q_inv` is 1; `result` is `p % MOD`; `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`; `results` is a list containing \((2 \times \max(n, m)) \% \text{MOD}\), `answer`, and `p % MOD`; `low` and `high` are equal and represent the value of `answer`; `answer` is the value that satisfies `func_2(n, m, k, answer)`**
