Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is the original value plus `3 * t`, `low` and `high` are final values based on the binary search process for each iteration, `answer` is the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True` for each iteration, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer` for each iteration, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `p % MOD` for each iteration, `results` is a list containing `result` for each iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, each time updating `n`, `m`, and `k` from the `data` list and performing a binary search to find `answer`.
- After each iteration, `idx` is incremented by 3, moving to the next set of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- The loop continues until all `t` iterations are complete.
- For each iteration, `low` and `high` are updated to find the smallest `x` that satisfies `func_2(n, m, k, x)`.
- `answer` is set to this smallest `x`.
- `p` is set to `answer`.
- `q` and `q_inv` remain constant at 1.
- `result` is computed as `p % MOD`.
- `result` is appended to `results` after each iteration.
- Once all iterations are complete, `t` becomes 0, and `idx` will be the original value plus `3 * t` (which simplifies to the original value).

This ensures that after the loop completes, the variables reflect the final state after processing all `t` inputs, with `results` containing the results of each iteration.
