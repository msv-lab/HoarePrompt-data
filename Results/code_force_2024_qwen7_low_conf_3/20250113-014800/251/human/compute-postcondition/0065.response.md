The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, substituting this into the equation gives `low = (low + high) // 2 + 1`. The values of `high` and `mid` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`**
