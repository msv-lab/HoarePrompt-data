`idx` is increased by 3, so the value of `idx` is updated from its previous value plus 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is the original value plus 3, `low` and `high` are the same, `answer` is the same, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.**
