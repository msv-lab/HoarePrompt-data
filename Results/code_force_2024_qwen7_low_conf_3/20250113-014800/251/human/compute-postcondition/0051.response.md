The code sets `high` to `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is initially equal to `max(n, m)`, after executing this line, `high` will be `max(n, m) - 1`.

The initial values of the variables remain unchanged except for `high`, which is updated to `max(n, m) - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` is 0, `high` is `max(n, m) - 1`, `answer` is `max(n, m)`, `mid` is `max(n, m)`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, and the function `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`.**
