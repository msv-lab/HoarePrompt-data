Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^12, `h` and `w` are either halved (but at least one remains as 1 if it becomes 0.5 or less) or the maximum of half and 1, and `steps` is greater than 0. Moreover, `h * w` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
