The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high`. Given the initial state, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`. So, the new value of `high` is `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is the original value plus 3, `low` is `0`, `high` is `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`**
