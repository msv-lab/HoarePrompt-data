To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider what variables and their states are required for the loop to iterate through the `results` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `results`.
   - Each element `res` in `results` is used within the loop body.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `results` must contain at least one element.

2. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.
   - `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.
   - `idx` is the original value plus `3 * t`.
   - `low` and `high` are final values based on the binary search process for each iteration.
   - `answer` is the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True` for each iteration.
   - `p` is equal to the final value of `answer` for each iteration.
   - `q` is 1.
   - `q_inv` is 1.
   - `result` is `p % MOD` for each iteration.
   - `results` is a list containing `result` for each iteration.
   - `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]` for each iteration.

3. **Determining Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element.
   - The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `idx`, `low`, `high`, `answer`, `p`, `q`, `q_inv`, `result`, and `k` do not directly affect the execution of the loop. They are part of the loop's internal logic but do not influence whether `results` has elements.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `results` has at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`results` must have at least one element**
