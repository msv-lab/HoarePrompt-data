Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is some integer (unknown value).
   - `n` and `m` are integers derived from `data[idx]` and `data[idx + 1]` respectively.
   - `idx` is an index into the `data` list.
   - `low` and `high` are the final values based on the binary search process.
   - `answer` is the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`.
   - `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`.
   - `q` is `1`.
   - `q_inv` is the modular inverse of `1` modulo `MOD`.
   - `result` is `p`.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements: `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than `0` because the loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - After each iteration, `t` decreases by `1`.

Given that `t` is the number of iterations left, and the loop body is omitted, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is decreased by `1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Decrease `t` by `1`.
   - Determine new values for `n` and `m` based on the updated `idx` value.
   - Increase `idx` by `6` since the original problem statement suggests that `idx` is increased by `6` after processing each iteration.
   - `low`, `high`, `answer`, `p`, `q`, `q_inv`, `result`, and `results` remain unchanged as no other operations are specified in the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are the same, `answer` is the same, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.**

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are the same, `answer` is the same, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.**
