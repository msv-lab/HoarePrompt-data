The code sets `high` to `mid - 1`. This means that the previous value of `high` is now decreased by 1. The other variables (`low`, `mid`, `answer`) remain unchanged as the code only modifies `high`.

Output State: **`low` and `high` are unchanged or adjusted based on the outcome of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` ensuring that `low <= high` holds true; `mid` is updated to (low + high) // 2; `answer` is (low + high) // 2; `high` is `mid - 1`**
