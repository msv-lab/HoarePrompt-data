Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), `h` and `w` are either halved (but at least one remains as 1 if it becomes 0.5 or less), `steps` is greater than 1, and `h * w` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `h * w < k`, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return anything and the state of `h` and `w` remains unchanged.***
