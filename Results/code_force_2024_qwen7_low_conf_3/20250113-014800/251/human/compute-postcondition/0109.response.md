According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop continues as long as `results` has at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `results` must have at least one element.
- `res` is printed and its value remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still have at least one element. Since `res` is printed and its value remains unchanged, it implies that we are iterating through the elements of `results`. After printing one element, there should still be at least one more element left in `results`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `results` has at least two elements remaining, and `res` is set to the next element in `results`.

State: **`results` must have at least two elements, `res` is printed and its value remains unchanged**
