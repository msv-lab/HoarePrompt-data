The code updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The value of `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` is no longer relevant since it has been updated indirectly through the calculation of the new `low`.

Output State: **`low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is unchanged, and `mid` is no longer relevant.**
