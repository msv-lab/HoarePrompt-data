Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State Before the Loop
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`
- `idx` is increased by 6
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`
- `answer` is `2 * max(n, m)`
- `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`
- `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`
- `q` is 1
- `q_inv` is 1
- `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `while low <= high:`

### Analysis
For the loop to execute at least one time, the condition `low <= high` must be true initially.

- `low` is set to 0.
- `high` is set to `2 * max(n, m)`.

Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, the condition `low <= high` will always be true as long as `max(n, m)` is non-negative (which it is since it is derived from integer values).

### Conclusion
Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, the loop condition `low <= high` is already satisfied and will remain true for the first iteration. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to proceed.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` is 0, `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `answer` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`**

No additional state adjustments are required.
