The code calculates the new value of `mid` as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. This operation does not affect the values of `low` and `high`, but it updates `mid`. The condition `low <= high` is maintained.

Output State: **`low` and `high` are unchanged or adjusted based on the outcome of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` ensuring that `low <= high` holds true; `mid` is updated to (low + high) // 2.**
