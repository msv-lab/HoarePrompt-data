The code `result = p * q_inv % MOD` updates the value of `result`. Initially, `result` is equal to `answer`. The value of `q_inv` is the modular inverse of `q` modulo `MOD`, which is given as 1. So, `result` is updated to `p * 1 % MOD`, which simplifies to `p % MOD`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is \( t - 1 \); `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is the original value plus 3; `p` is `answer`; `q` is 1; `q_inv` is 1; `result` is `p % MOD`; `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`; `results` is a list containing \((2 \times \max(n, m)) \% \text{MOD}\) and `answer`; `low` and `high` are equal and represent the value of `answer`; `answer` is the value that satisfies `func_2(n, m, k, answer)`**
