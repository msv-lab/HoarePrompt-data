`high` is reassigned the value of `mid - 1`. From the initial state, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2. Therefore, after the assignment, `high` becomes (`low` + (`low` + `high`) // 2) - 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's simplify the expression for `high`:
- Initially, `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
- So, `high = (low + (low + high) // 2) - 1`.

This simplifies to:
- `high = (2*low + high) // 2 - 1`.

The other variables `low`, `mid`, and `answer` remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `answer` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `high` is (`2*low + high`) // 2 - 1**
