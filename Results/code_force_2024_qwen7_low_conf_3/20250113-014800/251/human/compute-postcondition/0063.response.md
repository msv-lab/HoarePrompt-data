`answer` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is the midpoint between `low` and `high`. The calculation for `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), so this value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `answer` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
