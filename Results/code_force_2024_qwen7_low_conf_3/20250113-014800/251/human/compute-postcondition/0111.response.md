According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `results` has at least two elements.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `results` must have at least two elements.
- `res` is printed and its value remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still have at least two elements. Since `res` is just being used in the loop body and its value remains unchanged, it does not affect the condition for the loop to continue. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `results` must have at least two elements.

State: **`results` must have at least two elements**
