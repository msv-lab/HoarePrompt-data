`low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is initially equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, substituting `mid` in the equation gives us `low` = (`low` + `high`) // 2 + 1. The state of `high` and `mid` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`low` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2 + 1, `high` is the same as the initial state, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2**
