The code snippet assigns the value of `data[idx + 2]` to `k`. Since `data[idx + 2]` is the integer value of `k`, no changes occur to the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `idx`, `low`, `high`, `answer`, `mid`, `p`, `q`, `q_inv`, `result`, or `results`. The only change is that `k` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is the final value determined by the loop, `answer` is the final value of `mid` calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`.**
