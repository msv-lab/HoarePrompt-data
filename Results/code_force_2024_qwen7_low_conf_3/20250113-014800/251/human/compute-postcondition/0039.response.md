The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. However, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `idx`, `low`, `high`, `answer`, `mid`, `p`, `q`, `q_inv`, or `result` are directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `low` is the final value determined by the loop (either the last `low` or `high`), `high` is the final value determined by the loop (either the last `low` or `high`), `answer` is the final value of `mid` calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`.**
