The variable `q` is reassigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `q` and retains the values of all other variables.

Output State: **`t` is \( t - 1 \); `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is the original value plus 3; `p` is `answer`; `q` is 1; `q_inv` is 1; `result` is `answer`; `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`; `results` is a list containing \((2 \times \max(n, m)) \% \text{MOD}\) and `answer`; `low` and `high` are equal and represent the value of `answer`; `answer` is the value that satisfies `func_2(n, m, k, answer)`**
