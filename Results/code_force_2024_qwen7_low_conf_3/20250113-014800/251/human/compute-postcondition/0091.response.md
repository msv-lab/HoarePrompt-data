`mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `answer` is also equal to `(low + high) // 2`. The line of code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to be `mid - 1`, which is equivalent to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. The values of `low`, `mid`, and `answer` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is unchanged, `high` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `answer` is `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` is unchanged, `high` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `answer` is `(low + high) // 2`**
