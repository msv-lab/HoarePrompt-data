Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `low` is the final value determined by the loop (either the last `low` or `high`), `high` is the final value determined by the loop (either the last `low` or `high`), `answer` is the final value of `mid` calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`. The loop ensures that `low <= high` and terminates when this condition no longer holds. If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, `high` is adjusted to `mid - 1`, otherwise `low` is adjusted to `mid + 1`.**
