The code sets `low` to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is known to be `(low + high) // 2`, and the condition `low <= high` must hold true. The value of `high` remains unchanged, and the value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` before this line of code is executed.

After executing `low = mid + 1`, the value of `low` is updated, but the value of `high` and the condition `low <= high` must still hold true. Since `mid` was previously calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, updating `low` to `mid + 1` means that the new `low` is one more than the previous `mid`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, and the condition `low <= high` still holds true.**
