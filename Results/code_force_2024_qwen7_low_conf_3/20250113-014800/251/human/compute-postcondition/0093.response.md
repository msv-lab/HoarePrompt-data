Postcondition: ***`low` and `high` remain unchanged in certain conditions. If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, then `high` is set to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is set to `(low + high) // 2`, and `answer` is set to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, and `mid` is set to `(low + high) // 2`.***
