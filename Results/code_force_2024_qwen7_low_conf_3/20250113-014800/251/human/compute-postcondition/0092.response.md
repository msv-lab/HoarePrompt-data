The code sets `low` to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is initially `(low + high) // 2`, this means `low` is now one more than `mid`. Since `mid` was previously `(low + high) // 2`, we can express `low` in terms of `high`:

- Initially, `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
- After the code runs, `low = mid + 1 = (low + high) // 2 + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is (low + high) // 2 + 1, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is (low + high) // 2**
