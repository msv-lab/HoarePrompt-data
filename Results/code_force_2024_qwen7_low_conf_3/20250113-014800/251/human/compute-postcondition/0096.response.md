The code assigns the value of `mid` to `answer`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables (`low` and `high`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` and `high` must satisfy `low <= high`; `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `answer` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`low` and `high` must satisfy `low <= high`; `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `answer` is equal to `mid`**
