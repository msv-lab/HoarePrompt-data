The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
- `steps` is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps taken to reduce the area.

The function has two cases where it returns True, and one case where it returns True based on a specific condition involving `h * w` and `k`.

- If any of the first three cases return True, the function returns True.
- Otherwise, the function returns True if `h * w` is less than `k`, and returns False otherwise.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept four parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`, and return True if any of the first three cases are met, or if `h * w` (where `h` and `w` are the current height and width after `steps` cuts) is less than `k`. If none of these conditions are met, it returns False.
