The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2` and is initially set to be equal to `mid`, the only change here is to the value of `high`. The value of `low` remains unchanged, and the relationship `low <= high` is maintained unless `mid` equals `low` in which case `high` would become `low - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state includes:
- `low` remains the same as before.
- `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
- `mid` and `answer` remain equal to each other since no change was made to them directly by this line of code.

Output State: **`low` is the same as before; `high` is `mid - 1`; `mid` is equal to `answer`**
