`n` is assigned the value of `data[idx]`, converted to an integer. The value of `idx` is increased by 6, so the new value of `idx` is `idx + 6`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are the same, `answer` is the same, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are the same, `answer` is the same, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.**
