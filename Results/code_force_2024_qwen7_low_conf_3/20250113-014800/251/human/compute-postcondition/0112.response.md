The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of the variable `res`. However, in the initial state, `results` must have at least two elements, but no changes are made to any variables within the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` must have at least two elements, res is equal to the value of results (the first element of results is accessed for print)**
