`mid` is assigned the value `(low + high) // 2`. This calculates the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` and `high` must satisfy `low <= high`; `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` and `high` must satisfy `low <= high`; `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`**
