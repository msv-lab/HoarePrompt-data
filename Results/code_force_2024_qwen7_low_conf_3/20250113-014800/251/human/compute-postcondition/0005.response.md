The code snippet updates the value of `w` to the maximum of `w // 2` and 1. Since `w` is initially a positive integer and `h` is equal to `w`, the value of `w` will be halved (integer division) and then checked against 1 to ensure it does not drop below 1.

Given that `w` is a positive integer, `w // 2` will also be a positive integer unless `w` is 1, in which case `w // 2` will still be 0, but since `max(w // 2, 1)` is used, `w` will become 1.

Therefore, after executing the code, `w` will be updated to the maximum of its halved value and 1. Since `h` is equal to `w`, `h` will also be updated to this new value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `h` is the maximum of `w // 2` and 1, `w` is the maximum of `w // 2` and 1, and `steps` is greater than 0.**
