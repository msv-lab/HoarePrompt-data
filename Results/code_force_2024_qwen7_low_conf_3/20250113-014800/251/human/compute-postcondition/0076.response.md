The code snippet assigns the value of `data[idx + 2]` converted to an integer to the variable `k`. The variables `idx` is increased by 6, and no other variables are affected.

- Initially, `idx` is increased by 6.
- `k` is assigned the value of `data[idx + 2]` as an integer.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `idx` is increased by 6.
- `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `answer`, `p`, `q`, `q_inv`, `result`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are the same, `answer` is the same, `p` is the same, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD` and `p`.**
