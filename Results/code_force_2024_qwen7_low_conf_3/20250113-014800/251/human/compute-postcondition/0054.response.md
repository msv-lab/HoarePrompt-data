Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are updated based on the return value of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`, `answer` is either `max(n, m)` or `2 * max(n, m)`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`. If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, then `high` is `max(n, m) - 1` and `answer` is `max(n, m)`. Otherwise, `low` is `max(n, m) + 1` and `answer` is `2 * max(n, m)`.*
