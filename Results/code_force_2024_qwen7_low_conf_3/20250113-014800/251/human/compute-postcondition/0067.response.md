Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are final values based on the binary search process, `answer` is the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to narrow down the range between `low` and `high` until `low` exceeds `high`.
- `answer` is updated to the midpoint `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
- When `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- The loop terminates when `low` is no longer less than or equal to `high`.
- `answer` is the final value of `low` or `high` depending on the last comparison, which is the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`.
