According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `steps`. For the loop to execute, `steps` must be at least 1 because the `range(steps)` function generates numbers from 0 to `steps-1`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `h`, and `w` do not affect whether the loop can execute, as they are not used in the loop condition.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `steps` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `h` is `n`, `w` is `m`, and `steps` is greater than 0**
