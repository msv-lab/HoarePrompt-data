Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`. It initializes `h` and `w` to the values of `n` and `m`, respectively. The function then enters a loop that iterates up to `steps` times, halving either `h` or `w` (whichever is larger) in each iteration, ensuring that both `h` and `w` remain at least 1. After the loop, the function checks if the product of `h` and `w` is less than `k`.

If the loop completes without the product of `h` and `w` being less than `k`, the function returns `False`. However, due to the postconditions provided, there are three cases where the function returns `True`:

1. If `h > w` and `h` is halved in the first iteration.
2. If `w > h` and `w` is halved in the first iteration.
3. If `h * w` becomes less than `k` during the loop.

Therefore, the function returns `True` if any of the first three cases occur or if the product of `h` and `w` is less than `k` after the loop. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `False`.**

**Edge cases to consider:**
- If `n` or `m` is 1, the loop will not execute since `h` or `w` will already be 1.
- If `k` is very large, the loop might not reduce the dimensions sufficiently to meet the condition `h * w < k`, leading to a `False` return.
- If `steps` is 0, the function immediately returns `h * w < k`, which could be `True` if `h` and `w` are both 1 and `k` is greater than 1.
