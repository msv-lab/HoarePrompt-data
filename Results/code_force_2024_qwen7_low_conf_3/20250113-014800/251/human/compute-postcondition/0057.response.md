The code assigns the value of `mid` to `answer`. This means `answer` now holds the value of `mid`. The precondition that `low` is less than or equal to `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` is still equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `answer` is (`low` + `high`) // 2**
