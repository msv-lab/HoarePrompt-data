The code `q = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `q`. This does not affect any other variables, so the only change is in the value of `q`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are final values based on the binary search process, `answer` is the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`.**
