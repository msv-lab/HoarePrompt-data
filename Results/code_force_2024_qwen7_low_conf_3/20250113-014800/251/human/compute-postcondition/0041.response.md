The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows:

- `n` was previously the integer value of `data[idx]`
- `idx` was increased by 3
- `low` and `high` were determined by the loop
- `answer` was the final value of `mid` calculated as `(low + high) // 2`
- `mid` was the final value of `(low + high) // 2`
- `p` was equal to the final value of `answer`
- `q` was 1
- `q_inv` was 1
- `result` was `answer % MOD`
- `results` was a list containing one element which was `result`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is the final value determined by the loop, `answer` is the final value of `mid` calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.
