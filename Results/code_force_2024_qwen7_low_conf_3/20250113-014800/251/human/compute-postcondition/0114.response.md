The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Given the constraints, it seems the function might be dealing with predefined or global variables, but based on the provided format, we only focus on the formal parameters.

The functionality of the function `func_1` is to process certain conditions involving integers `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are constrained as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 57000.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}.
- The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.

However, since no specific operations or return values are provided in the output, we can only describe the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes integers `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` under specific constraints.**
