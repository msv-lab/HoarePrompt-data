Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `low <= high`.
2. **Loop Body Actions**:
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`:
     - `high` is set to `mid - 1`
     - `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`
     - `answer` is set to `mid`
   - Otherwise (if `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False`):
     - `low` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`
     - `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`
     - `high` remains unchanged

To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to continue, we need to consider the condition `low <= high` and how each case affects this condition.

### Case Analysis:

1. **Case where `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`**:
   - `high` becomes `mid - 1`
   - `low` is now at least `(low + (mid - 1)) // 2 + 1` (since `low` is updated in the else block)
   - `mid` is now recalculated, but `low <= high` still holds because `low` is updated in the else block.
   - For the loop to continue, we need `low <= high`, which is true since `high` was reduced but `low` was adjusted accordingly.

2. **Case where `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False`**:
   - `low` becomes `(low + high) // 2 + 1`
   - `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`
   - `high` remains unchanged
   - For the loop to continue, we need `low <= high`. Since `low` increases and `high` remains the same, the new `low` should be less than or equal to `high`.

### Determining Necessary Adjustments:

- **If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`**:
  - `high` needs to be adjusted to `mid - 1`.
  - `mid` and `answer` are recalculated, but the core condition `low <= high` still holds.

- **If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False`**:
  - `low` needs to be adjusted to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
  - `mid` is recalculated, but the core condition `low <= high` still holds.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to continue, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `low <= high` holds true after the updates. Therefore, the final state should reflect that `low` and `high` are unchanged or adjusted such that the condition `low <= high` is met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` and `high` are unchanged or adjusted based on the outcome of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`, ensuring that `low <= high` holds true.**
