The code `low = mid + 1` assigns the value of `mid + 1` to `low`. Given that `mid` is equal to `max(n, m)`, the value of `low` becomes `max(n, m) + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` is `max(n, m) + 1`, `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `answer` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `mid` is `max(n, m)`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, and the function `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns False.**
