The code snippet `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. Since the initial values of `low` and `high` are not specified, we will keep them as they are, but we will update the value of `mid`.

Output State: **`low` is unchanged, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is (low + high) // 2**
