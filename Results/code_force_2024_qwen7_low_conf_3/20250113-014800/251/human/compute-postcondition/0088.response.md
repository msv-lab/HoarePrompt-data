Let's break down the given state and the `while` loop condition to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( t \) is \( t - 1 \)
- \( n \) is the integer value of \( data[idx] \)
- \( m \) is the integer value of \( data[idx + 1] \)
- \( idx \) is the original value plus 3
- \( p \) is the same
- \( q \) is 1
- \( q_inv \) is the same
- \( result \) is \( p \)
- \( k \) is the integer value of \( data[idx + 2] \)
- \( results \) is a list containing two elements which are \( (2 * \max(n, m)) \% MOD \) and \( p \)
- \( mid \) is \( \max(n, m) * 10 \)

### While Loop Condition:
```python
while low <= high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- The current values are:
  - `low = max(n, m) * 10`
  - `high = max(n, m) * 20` if `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False`
  - `low = max(n, m) * 10` and `high = max(n, m) * 10 - 1` if `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`

Since `low` is already set to `max(n, m) * 10`, the only way for the loop to continue is if `high` is greater than or equal to `low`.

### Determining Necessary Adjustments:
- Since `low` is fixed at `max(n, m) * 10`, the only variable that can change to ensure the loop continues is `high`.
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False`, `high` is initially set to `max(n, m) * 20`.
- To continue the loop, we need `high` to remain greater than or equal to `low`, which is `max(n, m) * 10`.

Thus, no adjustments are necessary for `n` and `m` because they don't affect the comparison between `low` and `high`.

### Final State:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `high` remains greater than or equal to `low`.

**State:** **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is the original value plus 3, `p` is the same, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is the same, `result` is `p`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are \( (2 * \max(n, m)) \% MOD \) and `p`, `mid` is \( \max(n, m) * 10 \), `high` must be greater than or equal to `max(n, m) * 10`**
