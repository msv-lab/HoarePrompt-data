According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `steps`. The loop can execute again if `steps` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\)
- `h` and `w` are either halved (but at least one remains as 1 if it becomes 0.5 or less)
- `steps` is greater than 0
- `h * w` is greater than or equal to `k`

For the loop to execute one more time, `steps` must be greater than 0. Since we know that `steps` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 for the next iteration.

The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `steps`, which will be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), `h` and `w` are either halved (but at least one remains as 1 if it becomes 0.5 or less), `steps` is greater than 1, and `h * w` is greater than or equal to `k`**
