Postcondition: **`low` and `high` are unchanged or adjusted based on the outcome of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`, ensuring that `low <= high` holds true; `mid` is updated to (low + high) // 2; `answer` is (low + high) // 2; if `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is True, then `high` is `mid - 1`; if `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is False, then `low` is `mid + 1` and `high` remains unchanged.**
