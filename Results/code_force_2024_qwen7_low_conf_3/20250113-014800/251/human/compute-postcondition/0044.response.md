The code `idx += 3` increments the value of `idx` by 3. The value of `idx` was previously increased by 3, so incrementing it again by 3 will further increase its value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is the final value determined by the loop, `answer` is the final value of `mid` calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`**
