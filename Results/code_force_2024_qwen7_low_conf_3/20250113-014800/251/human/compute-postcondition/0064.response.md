`high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `high` is `(low + (low + high) // 2) // 2 - 1`. The values of `low`, `mid`, and `answer` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `answer` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is equal to `(low + (low + high) // 2) // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `answer` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is equal to `(low + (low + high) // 2) // 2 - 1`**
