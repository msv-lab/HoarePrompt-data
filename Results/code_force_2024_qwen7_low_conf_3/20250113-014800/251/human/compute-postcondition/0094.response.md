Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given Program State
- `low` and `high` remain unchanged in certain conditions.
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, then:
  - `high` is set to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`
  - `mid` is set to `(low + high) // 2`
  - `answer` is set to `(low + high) // 2`
- Otherwise:
  - `low` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`
  - `mid` is set to `(low + high) // 2`

### While Loop Condition
```
while low <= high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

#### Case 1: `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is True
- In this case, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.
- `low` remains the same.
- The new value of `high` will be smaller than the original `high`, but it still needs to be checked against `low` to determine if the loop should continue.

#### Case 2: `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is False
- In this case, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
- `high` remains the same.
- The new value of `low` will be larger than the original `low`, but it still needs to be checked against `high` to determine if the loop should continue.

### Determining the Next Iteration State
For the loop to continue executing one more time, the condition `low <= high` must hold true. This means that we need to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that the values of `low` and `high` can change based on the outcome of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`, we need to consider both possible outcomes:

- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is True, `high` decreases but `low` remains the same.
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is False, `low` increases but `high` remains the same.

To ensure the loop continues, we need to ensure that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`:

- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is True, `high` is reduced but `low` remains the same, so we need to ensure that `low` is still less than or equal to the new value of `high`.
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is False, `low` is increased but `high` remains the same, so we need to ensure that the new value of `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can continue:

### Final Answer
State: **`low` and `high` must satisfy `low <= high`**
