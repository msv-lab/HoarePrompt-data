The code snippet updates the value of `q_inv` to be the modular inverse of `q` using the formula `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)`. This means `q_inv` is now the modular inverse of `q` modulo `MOD`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `low` and `high` are final values based on the binary search process, `answer` is the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`, `p` is equal to the final value of `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the modular inverse of `q` modulo `MOD`, `result` is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(2 * max(n, m)) % MOD`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `mid` is the final value of `(low + high) // 2`.**
