The function reads input from stdin, processes `t` test cases, and computes a result for each test case based on given integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `x` such that `func_2(n, m, k, x)` returns `True`. It then calculates a result using modular arithmetic and appends it to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result. Potential edge cases include the input constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 57000, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}) and the condition that the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The function also includes a missing annotation for the `func_2` function call, which should be described as performing some boolean check based on the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `mid`.
