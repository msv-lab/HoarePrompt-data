The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters as shown in the provided code snippet. Instead, it implies that the function will process inputs through its body, but the parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not directly listed in the function definition. Given the constraints, the function likely processes these parameters internally.

Based on the problem description, the function will work with a series of test cases, each consisting of `t` test instances, where each instance includes three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific ranges.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes `t` test cases, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50), and returns the result based on these inputs.**
