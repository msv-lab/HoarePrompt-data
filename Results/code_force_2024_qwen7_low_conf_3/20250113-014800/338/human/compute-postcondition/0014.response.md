Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; if `max_color + k >= n`, the print statement outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, the print statement outputs 'YES'.***
