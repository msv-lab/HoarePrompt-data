The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not change the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; `i` is `t`; printed value is 'NO'**
