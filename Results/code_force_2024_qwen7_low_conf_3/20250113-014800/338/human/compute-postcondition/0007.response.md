The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Each of these parameters is an integer with specific constraints: 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50, and 1 ≤ t (where t is the test case count) ≤ 1000. 

Based on the given cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 'NO'.
- Case_2: The function returns 'YES'.
- Case_3: The function returns 'NO'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and return either 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions within the specified constraints.
