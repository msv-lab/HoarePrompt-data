The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `max_color`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; print statement outputs 'NO'**
