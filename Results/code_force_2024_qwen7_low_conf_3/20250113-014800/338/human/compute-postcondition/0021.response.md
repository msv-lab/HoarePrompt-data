Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` and `m` are the last values read from the input during any iteration, `k` is the last value read from the input during any iteration, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\); for each iteration of the loop, if `max_color + k >= n`, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is 'YES'.**
