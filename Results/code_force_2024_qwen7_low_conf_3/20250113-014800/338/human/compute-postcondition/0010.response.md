The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `max_color`, and the previously updated values of `n` and `m` are affected. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the values read from the input.
- `max_color` is equal to \((n + m - 1) / m\).

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` are now the integers read from the input, and `k` is also an integer read from the input. The value of `max_color` is no longer valid because it was dependent on the initial values of `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input**
