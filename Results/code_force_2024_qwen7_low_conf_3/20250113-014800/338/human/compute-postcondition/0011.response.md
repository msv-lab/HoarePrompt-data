`max_color` is assigned the value `(n + m - 1) / m`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input, so their values remain unknown. However, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`**
