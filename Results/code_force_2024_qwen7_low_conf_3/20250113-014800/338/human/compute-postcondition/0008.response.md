Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are integers constrained by 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. It returns either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions:
- If `m == k` or `k > n`, the function returns 'NO'.
- If `m > k`, the function returns 'YES'.
- Otherwise, the function returns 'NO'.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the evaluated conditions. There are no additional side effects or changes to external states.**

**Edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The condition `m > k` is correctly handled, leading to a 'YES' return.
- However, the condition `m == k` is also correctly handled, leading to a 'NO' return, ensuring that if `m` equals `k` and `k` is within the valid range, 'NO' is returned.
- The condition `k > n` is correctly handled, leading to a 'NO' return, ensuring that if `k` exceeds `n`, 'NO' is returned.
- No explicit handling is required for the case where `m` is less than `k` but not equal to `k`, as this scenario is already covered by the `m > k` condition returning 'YES'.**

This summary captures the essential behavior of the function, including the conditions that lead to a 'YES' or 'NO' return, and ensures that all relevant edge cases are considered.
