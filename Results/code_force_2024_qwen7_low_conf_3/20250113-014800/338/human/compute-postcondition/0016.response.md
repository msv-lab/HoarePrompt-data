The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, while the other variables (`t`, `max_color`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; `i` is `t`.**
