The code prints 'YES', which does not affect the values of any variables. The preconditions and values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; print statement 'YES' executed.**
