Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. It then calculates `max_color` as `(n + m - 1) / m`. If `max_color + k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything explicitly, but outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `n`, `m`, and `k` are at their boundary values (1 or 50). Missing functionality includes handling invalid input such as non-integer values or values outside the specified ranges, which would need to be added to ensure robustness.**
