Reasoning:

1. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes three parameters \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) and returns either "YES" or "NO" based on whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
2. Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:
   - If \(m = k\) or \(k > n\), the function returns "NO". This condition means that either Bob has enough parts to change the color of all parts or he can potentially change the color of more parts than there are, making it trivial for him to achieve a uniform color.
   - If \(m > k\), the function returns "YES". This condition means that there are more colors available than the maximum number of parts Bob can change, making it impossible for Bob to force all parts to have the same color.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns "NO", which is not covered by the problem statement's logic since it doesn't align with the examples provided.

3. We need to verify if the function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, we should check if the function handles all cases as per the examples given.

Based on the examples provided:
- For the case where \(n = 1, m = 1, k = 1\), the output is "NO" (which matches the logic).
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 1, k = 1\), the output is "NO" (which matches the logic).
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 2, k = 1\), the output is "YES" (which matches the logic since \(m > k\)).
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 2, k = 2\), the output is "NO" (which matches the logic since \(m = k\)).
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 5, k = 3\), the output is "YES" (which matches the logic since \(m > k\)).

The function `func_1` does correctly implement the logic as demonstrated by the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
