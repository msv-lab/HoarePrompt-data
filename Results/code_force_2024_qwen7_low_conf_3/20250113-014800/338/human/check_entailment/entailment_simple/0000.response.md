Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the logic required to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Here’s why:

1. **Problem Description Requirement**: 
   - Alice and Bob have a ribbon with \( n \) parts.
   - Alice can paint each part with one of \( m \) colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most \( k \) parts to the same color.
   - Alice needs to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Current Implementation Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` checks two conditions:
     - If \( m = k \) or \( k > n \), it returns 'NO'.
     - If \( m > k \), it returns 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Flaws in Current Implementation**:
   - The condition \( m = k \) or \( k > n \) alone is insufficient to determine if Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. For example:
     - In the test case \( (5, 1, 1) \), the current implementation returns 'NO', which is correct because if there is only one color and Bob can repaint one part, he can still make all parts the same color.
     - However, consider the test case \( (5, 2, 1) \). According to the problem description, Alice can paint the ribbon as \( [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] \), which ensures Bob cannot make all parts the same color. But the current implementation incorrectly returns 'NO' because \( m \neq k \).
   - The condition \( m > k \) is not sufficient either. For example, in the test case \( (5, 2, 2) \), even though \( m > k \), Alice cannot guarantee that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. If Alice paints the ribbon as \( [1, 1, 2, 2, 2] \), Bob can still make all parts the same color by repainting one '2' to '1'.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the logic should be:
- If \( m \leq k \), Bob can always repaint the parts to match any single color, so Alice cannot prevent him. Hence, the answer is 'NO'.
- If \( m > k \), Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. For example, she can paint \( \lceil \frac{n}{k+1} \rceil \) parts with each of the \( m \) colors, ensuring that Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all the same color.

Here’s a corrected version of the code:
```python
from math import ceil

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if m <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
```

### Correctness: **True**
The revised program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It returns 'NO' if \( m \leq k \) and 'YES' if \( m > k \), ensuring that Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
