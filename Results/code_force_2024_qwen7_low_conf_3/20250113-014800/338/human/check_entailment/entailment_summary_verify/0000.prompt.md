You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if m == k or k > n:
        return 'NO'
    elif m > k:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are integers constrained by 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. It returns either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions:
- If `m == k` or `k > n`, the function returns 'NO'.
- If `m > k`, the function returns 'YES'.
- Otherwise, the function returns 'NO'.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the evaluated conditions. There are no additional side effects or changes to external states.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly returns 'NO' for the case when `m > k`, which is not always true according to the problem description.

According to the problem description, if `m` (the number of colors) is greater than `k` (the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint), Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. This is because Bob can only repaint at most `k` parts, but if there are more than `k` different colors, Bob cannot ensure that all parts will have the same color after repainting.

However, the provided code incorrectly returns 'NO' in this case. For example, consider the test case:

```
5 2 1
```

Here, `n = 5`, `m = 2`, and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. One possible way to do this is to paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. No matter which part Bob repaints, he cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the program returns 'NO' in this case.

To fix this, the program should return 'YES' when `m > k` instead of 'NO'.
