Reasoning:

1. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes three parameters \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) and returns either "YES" or "NO" based on whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
2. Let's reanalyze the logic of `func_1`:
   - If \(m == k\) or \(k > n\), the function returns "NO". This condition means that either Bob has enough parts to change the color of all parts or he can potentially change the color of more parts than there are, making it trivial for him to achieve a uniform color.
   - If \(m > k\), the function returns "YES". This condition means that there are more colors available than the maximum number of parts Bob can change, making it impossible for Bob to force all parts to have the same color.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns "NO", which is a default condition but not aligned with the examples provided.

3. Let's verify if the function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, we should check if the function handles all cases as per the examples given.

Re-evaluation based on examples:
- For the case where \(n = 1, m = 1, k = 1\), the output is "NO" (which matches the logic).
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 1, k = 1\), the output is "NO" (which matches the logic).
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 2, k = 1\), the output is "YES" (which matches the logic since \(m > k\)).
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 2, k = 2\), the output is "NO" (which matches the logic since \(m = k\)).
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 5, k = 3\), the output is "YES" (which matches the logic since \(m > k\)).

However, let's consider another scenario to further validate the function:
- For the case where \(n = 5, m = 3, k = 2\), the output should be "YES" because \(m > k\), but the function returns "NO".

Given the above re-evaluation, the function does not handle the case where \(m > k\) correctly. The function incorrectly returns "NO" in some scenarios, particularly when \(m > k\), which contradicts the expected logic.

Final: **False**

Explanation: The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the function `func_1` is correct based on the provided examples. Upon closer inspection, the function fails to correctly identify the cases where \(m > k\), leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.
