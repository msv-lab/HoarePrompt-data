### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the logic of the `func_1` function based on the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if \(m == k\) or \(k > n\). If either condition is true, it returns "NO". This condition is correct because if \(m == k\) or \(k > n\), Bob can always achieve a uniform color.
   - The function then checks if \(m > k\). If this condition is true, it returns "YES". This condition is also correct because if \(m > k\), there are more colors available than the number of parts Bob can change, making it impossible for Bob to force all parts to have the same color.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns "NO". However, this is not aligned with the problem requirements, as it should handle the case where \(m \leq k < n\).

2. **Example Verification**:
   - For \(n = 1, m = 1, k = 1\): The function returns "NO" (correct).
   - For \(n = 5, m = 1, k = 1\): The function returns "NO" (correct).
   - For \(n = 5, m = 2, k = 1\): The function returns "YES" (correct).
   - For \(n = 5, m = 2, k = 2\): The function returns "NO" (correct, but the problem requires checking if Alice can prevent Bob from achieving uniformity, which is not fully covered here).
   - For \(n = 5, m = 5, k = 3\): The function returns "YES" (correct).

3. **Key Issue**:
   - The function does not cover the scenario where \(m \leq k < n\). In this case, Alice can still paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve a uniform color. For example, if \(n = 5, m = 2, k = 3\), Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. Bob can change at most 3 parts, but he cannot make all parts the same color because there are only two distinct colors.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function correctly identifies cases where Bob can easily achieve a uniform color (i.e., \(m == k\) or \(k > n\)), and it correctly identifies cases where Alice can prevent Bob from achieving a uniform color (i.e., \(m > k\)). However, it does not correctly handle the case where \(m \leq k < n\), which is a valid scenario according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the function does not cover all scenarios as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
