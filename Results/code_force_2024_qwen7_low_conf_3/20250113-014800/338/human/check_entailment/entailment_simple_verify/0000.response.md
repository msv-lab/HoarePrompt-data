### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does indeed handle the case incorrectly where `m > k`. Let's break down the issue with the current implementation and then correct it.

#### Current Implementation Issues:
1. **Incorrect Return Value for `m > k`:**
   - The program returns 'NO' when `m > k`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, if there are more colors (`m`) than parts Bob can repaint (`k`), Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

2. **Handling Cases Correctly:**
   - When `m == k` or `k > n`, Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts have the same color, hence 'NO'.
   - When `m > k`, Alice can paint the ribbon to avoid Bob making all parts have the same color, hence 'YES'.

#### Corrected Implementation:
- The logic needs to be reversed for the condition `m > k`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if m == k or k >= n:
        return 'NO'
    else:
        return 'YES'
```

### Final Evaluation:
- **Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `m > k`. By fixing the logic as described above, the program can accurately determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Therefore, the final evaluation remains **False** because the original program is incorrect.
