Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the function `func_1` evaluates the conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
3. The logic of `func_1` is as follows:
   - If `m == k` or `k > n`, return 'NO'. This is because if Bob can repaint exactly `m` parts or more than `n` parts, he can always make all parts the same color.
   - If `m > k`, return 'YES'. This is because if there are more colors available than the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint, Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - Otherwise, return 'NO'. This is the default case where neither of the previous conditions are met.
4. The program's logic matches the requirements of the problem statement and the examples provided.
5. The function `func_1` is called with the correct parameters, and the output is printed based on the function's return value.

Correctness: **True**
