Reasoning:
The given program logic in the function `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

1. The condition `if m == k or k > n:` ensures that if Bob can either choose exactly the same number of parts as there are colors or more than the total number of parts, he can always paint the entire ribbon the same color. Hence, it returns 'NO' in these cases.
2. The condition `elif m > k:` ensures that if the number of available colors (`m`) is greater than the number of parts Bob can repaint (`k`), then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Hence, it returns 'YES' in this case.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'NO', which means it is not possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the function accurately determines whether Alice can achieve her goal for each test case.

Execution Summary:
- The function `func_1` processes each test case independently.
- It correctly evaluates the conditions and returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on the problem's requirements.
- The output matches the expected results provided in the examples.

Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the given problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
