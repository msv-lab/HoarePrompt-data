The function `traverse` accepts three parameters: `node`, `parent`, and `tree`. It traverses the tree starting from the given `node`, counting the number of neighbors of `node` that are not the `parent` and have a `'P'` (Partygoer) student type. If the current node has a `'P'` student type, it returns the count plus one. If the current node has a `'S'` (Student) student type, it returns the maximum of zero and the count minus one. If the current node has any other student type, it returns the count. This process continues recursively for all neighbors of the current node until all nodes have been visited. The function does not modify the input parameters `node`, `parent`, `tree`, or `student_types`.
