t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a list of integers a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i < i represents the edges of the tree, and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C' representing the types of students in each room. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
