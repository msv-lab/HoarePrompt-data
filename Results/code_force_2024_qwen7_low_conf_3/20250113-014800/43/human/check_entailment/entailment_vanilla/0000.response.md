Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided solution, let's break down the logic of the program step by step and compare it with the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases, the number of vertices `n`, the parent array `fa`, and the string `S` indicating the type of each student.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program initializes two arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to store the minimum number of walls required when ending with a 'S' student and a 'P' student, respectively.

3. **Backward DP Calculation**:
   - For each node `i` starting from the last node (i.e., leaf nodes) to the root, the program updates `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` based on the values of its parent node `p`.
   - If the current student `i` is a 'S' student, `dp1[i]` is set to infinity because we do not want any music to reach this student.
   - If the current student `i` is a 'P' student, `dp2[i]` is set to infinity because we want to ensure music reaches this student.
   - For each child `i`, the parent `p` updates its `dp1` and `dp2` values based on the minimum cost of keeping music out (`dp1`) or in (`dp2`) from its child `i`.

4. **Result Calculation**: The final result for each test case is the minimum value between `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]`, representing the minimum number of walls required.

Let's analyze if this approach correctly solves the problem:
- The program correctly identifies that placing a wall between a 'P' and a 'S' student ensures that the music does not reach the 'S' student while still allowing it to reach other 'P' students.
- By using dynamic programming in a backward manner, the program ensures that the minimum number of walls required is computed efficiently.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps taken by the program, it appears that the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
