Reasoning:
1. **Input Processing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases, \( n \), the parent nodes for constructing the tree, and the string \( s \) representing the types of students.
2. **Tree Construction**: The function uses the parent nodes to construct the tree, which is essential for calculating the minimum number of thick walls required.
3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Two DP arrays, `dp1` and `dp2`, are initialized. These arrays are used to calculate the minimum cost of placing thick walls in a way that ensures no sleeping student can hear the music from partying students.
4. **Backward Calculation**: The function iterates backward through the nodes, updating `dp1` and `dp2` based on whether a student wants to party (`P`), sleep (`S`), or doesn't care (`C`). This ensures that the costs are calculated correctly considering the influence of thick walls.
5. **Cost Calculation**: For each node, the function updates the DP values based on whether a thick wall is placed on the edge leading to the current node. This is done to ensure that no sleeping student can hear the music.
6. **Result Calculation**: The function prints the minimum of `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]`, which represents the minimum number of thick walls required for the current test case.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The solution handles the construction of the tree, the dynamic programming approach to minimize the number of thick walls, and the calculation of the result.

Correctness: **True**
