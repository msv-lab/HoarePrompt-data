Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `dp1` and `dp2` seems flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

### Test Case:
```
3
1 1
CPP
```

#### Analysis:
- The tree structure is a single path: `1 -> 2`.
- Students are of types: `C`, `P`, `P`.

The expected answer should be `1` because placing a thick wall between room 1 and room 2 would prevent music from reaching the sleeping student in room 2.

However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly. Let's trace the logic:

1. For `i = 2`:
   - `S[2] == 'P'` so `dp2[2] = float('inf')`.
   - `p = fa[2] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`, `fa[2]` is not `-1`, so `dp1[0] += min(dp1[2], dp2[2] + 1)` and `dp2[0] += min(dp1[2] + 1, dp2[2])`.

2. For `i = 1`:
   - `S[1] == 'C'` so both `dp1[1]` and `dp2[1]` remain `0`.
   - `p = fa[1] - 1 = -1`, so no changes to `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]`.

Finally, the output is `min(dp1[0], dp2[0]) = min(0, 0) = 0`, which is incorrect.

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a partying student's music needs to be blocked from a sleeping student in the same path. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
