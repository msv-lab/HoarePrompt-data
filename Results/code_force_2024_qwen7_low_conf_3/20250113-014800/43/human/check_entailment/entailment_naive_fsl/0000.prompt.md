You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vladislav has a son who really wanted to go to MIT. The college dormitory at
MIT (Moldova Institute of Technology) can be represented as a tree with n
vertices, each vertex being a room with exactly one student. A tree is a
connected undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges.

Tonight, there are three types of students:

  * students who want to party and play music (marked with \texttt{P} ), 
  * students who wish to sleep and enjoy silence (marked with \texttt{S} ), and 
  * students who don't care (marked with \texttt{C} ). 

Initially, all the edges are thin walls which allow music to pass through, so
when a partying student puts music on, it will be heard in every room.
However, we can place some thick walls on any edges — thick walls don't allow
music to pass through them.

The university wants to install some thick walls so that every partying
student can play music, and no sleepy student can hear it.

Because the university lost a lot of money in a naming rights lawsuit, they
ask you to find the minimum number of thick walls they will need to use.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10^5 ) —
the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers a_2, \dots , a_n (1
\leq a_i < i ) — it means there is an edge between i and a_i in the tree.

The third line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting of
characters \texttt{P} , \texttt{S} , and \texttt{C} , denoting that student i
is of type s_i .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of thick
walls needed.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    CSP
    
    4
    
    1 2 2
    
    PCSS
    
    4
    
    1 2 2
    
    PPSS

Output

    1
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first case, we can install one thick wall between rooms 1 and 2 , as
shown below. We cannot install 0 walls, since then the music from room 3 will
reach room 2 where a student wants to sleep, so the answer is 1 . There are
other valid solutions.

Program:
```
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        fa = [-1] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        S = input()
        (dp1, dp2) = ([0] * (n + 1), [0] * (n + 1))
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if S[i] == 'S':
                dp1[i] = float('inf')
            elif S[i] == 'P':
                dp2[i] = float('inf')
            p = fa[i] - 1
            if p != -1:
                dp1[p] += min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)
                dp2[p] += min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])
        print(min(dp1[0], dp2[0]))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
