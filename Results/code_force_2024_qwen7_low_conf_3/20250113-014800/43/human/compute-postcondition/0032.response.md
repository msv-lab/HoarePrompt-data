The code `p = fa[i] - 1` simply assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. The value of `p` is now `fa[i] - 1`, but the values of `n`, `i`, `dp1[i]`, `dp2[i]`, and `S[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1`**
