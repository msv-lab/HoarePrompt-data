Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S'.
- `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P'.
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.
- If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are both set to `float('inf')`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1, meaning `i` is now `n - 2`.

### Adjusted States
- Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` is `n - 2`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be greater than or equal to 0. Since `n > 0` and `i` starts from `n - 1`, `i` will still be valid (i.e., `i >= 0`).

### New State for the Start of the Next Iteration
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is now `n - 2`.
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S'.
- `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P'.
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.
- If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are both set to `float('inf')`.

### Final State
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are both set to `float('inf')`.**

This state reflects the updated values of `i` and the conditions that must be met for the loop to continue executing.
