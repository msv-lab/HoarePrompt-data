The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial values of the other variables (`i`, `dp1[0]`, `dp2[0]`) remain unchanged. The value of `min(dp1[0], dp2[0])` is already known from the initial state, which is `0` because `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` are both `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `dp1[0]` is 0, `dp2[0]` is 0, the value of `min(dp1[0], dp2[0])` is 0.**
