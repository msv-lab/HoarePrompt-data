The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is assigned the integer input from the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer input from the user**
