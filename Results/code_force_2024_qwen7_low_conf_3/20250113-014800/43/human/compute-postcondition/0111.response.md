Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `S[i] == 'S'`, `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')` and `dp2[i]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')` and `dp1[i]` remains unchanged. `dp1[p]` is updated to its current value plus `min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, and `dp2[p]` is updated to its current value plus `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.***
