Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `fa` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input representing parent nodes, `S` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C', `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of length `n + 1` initialized to `float('inf')`, `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` are the minimum values between paths in the tree starting from the root node considering the constraints given by the string `S`, and the output of the print statement is the minimum value between `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]`.**
