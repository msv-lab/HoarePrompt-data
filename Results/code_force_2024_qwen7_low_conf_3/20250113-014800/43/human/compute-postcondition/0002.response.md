The code initializes the list `fa` with a -1 at index 0 followed by integers split from the user's input. Since `n` is an integer input from the user, the list `fa` will have `n + 1` elements (including the initial -1). The values in the list are taken from the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer input from the user; `fa` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being -1 and the rest being the integers from the user's input.**
