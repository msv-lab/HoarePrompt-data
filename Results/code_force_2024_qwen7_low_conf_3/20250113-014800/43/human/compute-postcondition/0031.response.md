Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `S[i]` is 'S', and `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. If `S[i]` is 'S' and `p` is equal to -1, no updates are made. If `S[i]` is 'P', and `p` is not equal to -1, `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. If `S[i]` is 'P' and `p` is equal to -1, no updates are made. If `S[i]` is neither 'S' nor 'P', no updates are made to `dp1` and `dp2`.***
