Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `dp1[0]` is `float('inf')` if `S[0]` is 'S', `dp2[0]` is `float('inf')` if `S[0]` is 'P'. For all `j` from 0 to `n`, `dp1[j]` and `dp2[j]` are updated based on the values of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` where `i` is `fa[j] - 1`. If `fa[j]` is -1, then `dp1[j]` and `dp2[j]` remain as they were initialized (both 0). If `fa[j]` is not -1, then `dp1[j]` is updated to `dp1[j] + min(dp1[fa[j]], dp2[fa[j]] + 1)` and `dp2[j]` is updated to `dp2[j] + min(dp1[fa[j]] + 1, dp2[fa[j]])`.**
