Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p] is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `S[i] == 'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')` and `dp2[i]` remains unchanged. If `S[i] == 'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as specified in the if and else parts.***
