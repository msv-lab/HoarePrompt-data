Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S', `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros, `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input, `S` is the input string, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, and `p` is not equal to -1***
