Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) (the number of nodes in a tree), a list of parent nodes, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C'. It constructs a tree from the parent nodes and calculates two dynamic programming arrays, \( dp1 \) and \( dp2 \), which represent the minimum costs to reach the root node under specific conditions defined by the string \( s \). After processing all test cases, the function prints the minimum value between \( dp1[0] \) and \( dp2[0] \) for the last test case. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs such as \( n \) outside the specified range or invalid characters in the string \( s \). The function does not handle these edge cases directly but expects valid input according to the constraints.**
