The code initializes two lists `dp1` and `dp2` with zeros, each of length `n + 1`. The length of these lists is determined by the value of `n`, which is an integer input from the user. The variables `t`, `fa`, and `S` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dp1` and `dp2` have been initialized as lists of zeros with the specified length, while the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer input from the user; `fa` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being -1 and the rest being the integers from the user's input; `S` is a string input from the user; `dp1` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `dp2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
