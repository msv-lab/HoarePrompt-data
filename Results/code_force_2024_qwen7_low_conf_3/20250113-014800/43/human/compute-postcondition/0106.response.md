Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`; `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if the condition `S[i] == 'P'` is met. If the condition `S[i] == 'P'` is not met, the postcondition remains as specified in the if part.***
