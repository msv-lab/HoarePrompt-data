Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `p` is `fa[0] - 1`. If `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, and `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf')`. Additionally, `dp2[-1]` is `float('inf')`. If `S[i] == 'S'` holds true, `dp1[-1]` is `float('inf')`. If `S[i] == 'S'` does not hold true, the current state of the variables remains unchanged.***
