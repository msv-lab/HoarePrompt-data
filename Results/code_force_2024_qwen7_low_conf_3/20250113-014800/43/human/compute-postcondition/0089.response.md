The code snippet `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S'.
- `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros.
- `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input.
- `S` is the input string.
- If `S[i]` is 'S', then `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`.
- If `S[i]` is not 'S', and specifically 'P', then `dp2[n-1]` is `float('inf')`.

Since `fa[i]` is an integer from the input, subtracting 1 from it results in another integer. The values of `n`, `i`, `dp1`, `dp2`, and `S` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S', `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros, `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input, `S` is the input string, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.**
