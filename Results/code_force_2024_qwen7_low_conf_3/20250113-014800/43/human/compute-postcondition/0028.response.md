The code `dp1[i] = float('inf')` sets the value of `dp1[i]` to `float('inf')`. According to the initial state, `i` is `n - 3`, and `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S'. Since the condition for `dp1[i]` being `float('inf')` is already satisfied (as per the initial state), setting it again does not change its value.

Therefore, the only change is in `dp1[i]`, which remains `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, and if `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. If `p` is equal to -1, no updates are made to `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]`.**
