Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i - 1` where `i` was either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S', `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros, `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input, `S` is the input string, and `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `S[i]` equals 'P', `dp2[i]` is updated to be the minimum of 1 and `dp2[i]`. If `S[i]` does not equal 'P', no changes are made to `dp1` and `dp2`.***
