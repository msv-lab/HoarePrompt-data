To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze what needs to be true for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
1. **min(dp1[0], dp2[0])** was printed.
2. `n` is an integer input.
3. `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input.
4. There is at least one more input remaining for the loop to execute one more time.
5. `S` is the input string.
6. `dp1` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
7. `dp2` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will start from `i = n-1` and go down to `i = 0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `dp1` and `dp2` are both lists of `n + 1` zeros.
   - `fa` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being `-1` and the rest are inputs.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `S` is a string input (though not used directly in the loop).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 0 because the range function requires the start value to be less than the stop value (exclusive).

3. **Input Requirement:**
   - It is mentioned that there is at least one more input remaining for the loop to execute one more time. This implies that the loop will at least run once, starting from `i = n-1`.

### Adjusted States:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the following states:
- `n` should be greater than 0.
- `i` should start at `n-1` (since the loop runs in reverse order).

### Final State Adjustment:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are already initialized to zeros, so no adjustments are needed for these.
- `fa` is already initialized with the required values.
- `S` is not used in the loop, so no adjustments are needed for this.

Therefore, the necessary states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must start at `n-1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` must start at `n-1`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros, `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input, `S` is the input string**.
