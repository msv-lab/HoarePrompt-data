The code initializes two lists `dp1` and `dp2` with length `n + 1`, each filled with zeros. This changes the values of `dp1` and `dp2` from their previous undefined states to a list of zeros. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `min(dp1[0], dp2[0])` is 0, `fa` is `[-1, a1, a2, ..., an]`, `S` is a string**
