The code `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to `p`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 0
- `p` is `fa[1]` - 1
- `dp1[p]` is `2 * dp1_value`
- `dp2[1]` is infinity
- If `S[i] == 'S'`, then `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[1] + 1, dp2[1])` and `dp1[0]` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp2[0]` is `float('inf')`.

Since `i` is 0, we follow the condition `if S[i] == 'S'`. Thus, `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[1] + 1, dp2[1])` and `dp1[0]` is set to `float('inf')`.

Let's update the values step-by-step:
1. `p` is updated to `fa[0] - 1`.
2. `dp2[p]` is updated based on the current value of `dp2[p]` (which is currently `infinity`) plus `min(dp1[1] + 1, dp2[1])`.
3. `dp1[0]` is set to `float('inf')`.

Given that `dp2[1]` is `infinity`, `min(dp1[1] + 1, dp2[1])` simplifies to `dp1[1] + 1` because `dp2[1]` is infinite.

Therefore, the new value for `dp2[p]` is `infinity + (dp1[1] + 1) = infinity` (since adding any finite number to infinity results in infinity).

So, the updated states are:
- `p` is `fa[0] - 1`
- `dp2[p]` remains `infinity`
- `dp1[0]` is `float('inf')`

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `p` is `fa[0]` - 1, `dp1[p]` is `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, `dp1[0]` is `float('inf')`**
