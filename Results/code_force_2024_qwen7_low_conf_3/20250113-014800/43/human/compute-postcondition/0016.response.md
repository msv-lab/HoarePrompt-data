The code snippet `dp2[p] += min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` updates the value of `dp2[p]`. To determine the updated value of `dp2[p]`, we need to consider the values of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]`.

From the initial state:
- `i` is initialized to `n - 1`.
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S'.
- `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P'.
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1` and `p` is not equal to -1.
- `dp1[p]` is `float('inf')`.

Since `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, let's assume `S[n-1]` is either 'S' or 'P'. We'll handle both cases.

### Case 1: `S[n-1]` is 'S'
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`.
- `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`.

The expression `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` simplifies to `min(float('inf') + 1, float('inf'))`, which is `float('inf')`.

Therefore, `dp2[p]` remains unchanged and is still `float('inf')`.

### Case 2: `S[n-1]` is 'P'
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`.
- `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`.

The expression `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` simplifies to `min(float('inf') + 1, float('inf'))`, which is `float('inf')`.

Therefore, `dp2[p]` remains unchanged and is still `float('inf')`.

In both cases, `dp2[p]` does not change.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1` and `p` is not equal to -1, `dp1[p]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2[p]` is `float('inf')`.**
