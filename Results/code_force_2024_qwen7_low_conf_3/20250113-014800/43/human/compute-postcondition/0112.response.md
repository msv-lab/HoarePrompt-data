Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is -1, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` and `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`, `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input, `S` is the input string, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `p` is not equal to -1, `dp1[p]` is the sum of `dp1[p]` and `min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, and `dp2[p]` is the sum of `dp2[p]` and `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. If `p` is equal to -1, no changes are made to `dp1` and `dp2`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Termination Condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`. After the loop completes, the index `i` becomes `-1`, meaning the loop has finished all its iterations.
2. **Values of Variables**:
   - `i`: Since the loop increments `i` by `-1` each iteration, when the loop terminates, `i` will be `-1`.
   - `dp1` and `dp2`: These lists are updated based on the conditions inside the loop. Each element `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` is updated based on the minimum values derived from the previous elements.
   - `fa`: This list remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `S`: The string remains unchanged.
   - `p`: This is calculated as `fa[i] - 1`, which will eventually become `-2` (since `i` is `-1`) and thus no longer valid, leading to no further updates to `dp1` and `dp2`.

Given these points, after the loop finishes executing, the final state of the variables is as described above.
