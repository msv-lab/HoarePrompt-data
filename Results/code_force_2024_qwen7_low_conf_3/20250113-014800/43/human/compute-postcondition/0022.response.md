Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are both set to `float('inf')`. If `S[i] == 'S'`, `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`. If `S[i] == 'P'`, `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`.***
