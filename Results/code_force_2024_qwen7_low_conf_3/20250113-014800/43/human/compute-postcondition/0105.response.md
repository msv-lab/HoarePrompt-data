In the given code snippet, `dp2[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. This overwrites the previous value of `dp2[i]` which was determined by the formula `dp2[p] = dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`; `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`.**
