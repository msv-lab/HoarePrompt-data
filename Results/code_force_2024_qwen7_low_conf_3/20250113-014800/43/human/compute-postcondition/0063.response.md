`dp2[p]` is incremented by the minimum value between `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, `p` is `fa[0] - 1`, and `dp2[p]` is initially `infinity`.

Since `i` is 0, we evaluate `dp1[i] + 1` which is `dp1[0] + 1`. From the initial state, `dp1[0]` is `float('inf')`. Therefore, `dp1[0] + 1` is also `float('inf')`.

Thus, the expression `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` simplifies to `min(float('inf'), infinity)`, which is `infinity`.

Therefore, `dp2[p]` is incremented by `infinity`, making `dp2[p]` still `infinity` since adding `infinity` to another `infinity` does not change its value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `p` is `fa[0] - 1`, `dp1[p]` is `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, `dp1[0]` is `float('inf')`**
