Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S'.
   - `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P'.
   - `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.
   - If `p` is not equal to -1, then:
     - `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`.
     - `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.
   - If `p` is equal to -1, no updates are made to `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `n - 1` to `-1` in reverse order.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 3`.
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `dp1` and `dp2` for `i = n - 3` depend on the value of `S[n - 3]` and `p = fa[n - 3] - 1`.
   - If `p` is not equal to -1, the values of `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` will be updated based on the values of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains the same: `n > 0`.
   - `i` is now `n - 3`.
   - `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S'.
   - `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P'.
   - `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.
   - If `p` is not equal to -1, the values of `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` will be updated as described.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. If `p` is equal to -1, no updates are made to `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]`.**
