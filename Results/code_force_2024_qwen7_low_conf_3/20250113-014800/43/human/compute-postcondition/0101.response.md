`dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. The value of `dp1[p]` was previously updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Let's break down the impact:

1. `dp1[p]` is already updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`.
2. Now, `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.

Since `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are both lists of `n + 1` zeros initially, and the only changes are due to the operations performed, we can infer that the values of `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are being updated based on the conditions given.

Given the initial state and the operation, the updated values of `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are:

- `dp1[p]` is now `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`.
- `dp2[p]` is now `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.

All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i - 1` where `i` was either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S'; `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`; `p` is `fa[i] - 1`**
