The code initializes `dp1[i]` to `float('inf')`. Given the initial state where `n` is greater than 0, `i` is currently initialized to `n - 1`, and the current value of `S[i]` is 'S', the variable `dp1[i]` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is currently initialized to `n - 1`, and the current value of `S[i]` is 'S'; `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`**
