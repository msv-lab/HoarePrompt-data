First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: 
  - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
  - `i` is -1
  - `p` is `fa[0] - 2`
  - `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`
  - `dp2[1]` is infinity
  - `dp2[p]` is infinity
  - `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf')`
  - `dp2[-1]` is `float('inf')`
  - `dp1[-1]` remains `float('inf')` if `S[i] == 'S'` does not hold true.

The code snippet updates `dp1[p]` by adding the minimum of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i] + 1`.

Given `i` is -1, let's check the values for `dp1[-1]` and `dp2[-1]`:
- Since `i` is -1, `S[i]` is `S[-1]`.
- From the initial state, `dp1[-1]` remains `float('inf')` if `S[-1] != 'S'`.

Now, let's apply the code snippet:
- The value of `dp1[p]` will be updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[-1], dp2[-1] + 1)`.
- Since `dp1[-1]` and `dp2[-1]` are both `float('inf')`, `min(dp1[-1], dp2[-1] + 1)` simplifies to `min(float('inf'), float('inf') + 1)`, which is `float('inf')`.

Therefore, `dp1[p]` remains unchanged because adding `float('inf')` to itself results in `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `p` is `fa[0] - 2`, `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf')`, `dp2[-1]` is `float('inf')`, `dp1[-1]` remains `float('inf')` if `S[i] == 'S'` does not hold true.**
