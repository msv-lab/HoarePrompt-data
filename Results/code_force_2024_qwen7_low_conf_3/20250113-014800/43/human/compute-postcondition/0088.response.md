Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S', `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros, `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input, `S` is the input string. If `S[i]` is 'S', then `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`. If `S[i]` is not 'S', and specifically 'P', then `dp2[n-1]` is `float('inf')`.***
