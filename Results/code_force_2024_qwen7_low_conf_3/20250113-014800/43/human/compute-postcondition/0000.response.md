Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
  - A list of \(n-1\) integers \(a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i < i\).
  - A string `s` of length \(n\) consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C'.
- The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

### Loop Statement:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The loop will run based on the number of test cases specified by `int(input())`.
2. **Test Case Execution**: For each test case, the loop will process the input values for `n`, the list of integers, and the string `s`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the input handling works correctly. Specifically, we need to confirm that the input is valid and the loop can proceed.

### Required States:

1. **Number of Test Cases**: The loop will run based on the input value for the number of test cases.
2. **Input Validation**: We need to ensure that the input values for `n`, the list of integers, and the string `s` are valid according to the problem constraints.

Given the constraints, the loop will execute as long as the input is valid. Therefore, the key state that needs to be adjusted is the number of test cases.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and `int(input())` must provide a valid number of test cases**.

This ensures that the loop can execute as expected based on the provided constraints.
