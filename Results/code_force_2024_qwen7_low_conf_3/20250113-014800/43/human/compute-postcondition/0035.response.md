Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` retain their initial states (both are `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S' or 'P'), `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` also retain their initial states (both are `float('inf')` if `S[p]` is 'S' or 'P'). Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when `p == -1`.***
