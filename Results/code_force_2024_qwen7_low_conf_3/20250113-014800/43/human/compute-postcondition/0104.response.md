The code `dp1[i] = float('inf')` assigns the value `float('inf')` to `dp1[i]`. Since `i` is defined as `i + 1` in the initial state and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be a non-negative integer starting from 1 up to `n`.

The previous state of `dp1` and `dp2` was such that `dp1[p]` was updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` was updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` for `p` being `fa[i] - 1`. However, now `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`, which means the value of `dp1[i]` is no longer influenced by its previous update logic.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`
- `dp2` remains unchanged from its previous state
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2` remains unchanged from its previous state, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`**
