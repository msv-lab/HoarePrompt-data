Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `p` is `fa[0] - 2`, `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf')`, `dp2[-1]` is `float('inf')`, and `dp1[-1]` remains `float('inf')` if `S[i] == 'S'` does not hold true. The condition `p != -1` is checked, and since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition holds true.***
