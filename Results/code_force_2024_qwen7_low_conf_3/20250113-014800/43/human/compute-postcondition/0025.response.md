Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, if `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])**
