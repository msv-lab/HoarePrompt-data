`dp2[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. Given that `i` is `-1`, this means `dp2[-1]` is now `float('inf')`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is -1; `p` is `fa[0] - 1`; if `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, and `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf'); `dp2[-1]` is `float('inf')**
