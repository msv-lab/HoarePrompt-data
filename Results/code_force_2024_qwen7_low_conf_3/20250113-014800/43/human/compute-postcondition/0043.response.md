Let's analyze the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is initially set to 1.
- `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
- `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
- `min(dp1[0], dp2[0])` is 0.
- `fa` is a list `[-1, a1, a2, ..., an]`.
- `S` is a string.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches -1.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0 (i.e., `n >= 1`).

2. **Variable `dp1` and `dp2`:**
   - Both `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
   - Since the lists are already initialized correctly, no adjustments are needed for these lists.

3. **Expression `min(dp1[0], dp2[0])`:**
   - This expression is already given as 0.
   - No adjustment is needed for this expression.

4. **List `fa`:**
   - The list `fa` is defined as `[-1, a1, a2, ..., an]`.
   - This definition does not affect the loop's execution directly.

5. **String `S`:**
   - The string `S` is not used within the loop itself and does not affect the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once is ensuring that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
