`dp2[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, this means that `dp2[n-1]` is set to infinity. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is now `n-1`; `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros; `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input; `S` is the input string; `S[i]` is not equal to 'S'; the current value of `S[i]` is 'P'; `dp2[n-1]` is `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is now `n-1`; `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros; `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input; `S` is the input string; `S[i]` is not equal to 'S'; the current value of `S[i]` is 'P'; `dp2[n-1]` is `float('inf')`**
