Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the given state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - The statement `print(min(dp1[0], dp2[0]))` was executed, which means the minimum value between `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` was printed.

2. **Analyze the for loop:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This indicates that the number of iterations is determined by the user input, which is converted to an integer.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by the user input, we need to ensure that the input provided allows for another iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have consumed one of the inputs specified by the user. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more input remaining.

4. **Formulate the new state:**
   - The variable `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` will be updated during each iteration, but the key factor here is the number of iterations left, which is controlled by the input.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that there is at least one more input remaining to allow the loop to execute one more time.

**State: **`print(min(dp1[0], dp2[0]))` is executed, and there must be at least one more input remaining for the loop to execute one more time.**
