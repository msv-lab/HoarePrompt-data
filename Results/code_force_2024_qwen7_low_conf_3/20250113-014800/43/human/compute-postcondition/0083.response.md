`dp1[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. This changes the value of `dp1` at index `i` to infinity. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` starts at `n-1`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros, `fa` is a list where the first element is -1 and the next `n` elements are integers from the input, `S` is the input string, and the current value of `i` is such that the character at index `i` in `S` is 'S', `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`**
