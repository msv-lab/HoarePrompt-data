Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i - 1` where `i` was either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S'. `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros. If `S[i]` is 'S', `dp1[p]` remains 0 and `dp2[p]` is updated to be the minimum of 1 and `dp2[i]` if `p` is not -1. If `p` is -1, no changes are made to `dp1` and `dp2`. If `S[i]` is 'P', `dp2[i]` is updated to be the minimum of 1 and `dp2[i]`. If `S[i]` is neither 'S' nor 'P', no changes are made to `dp1` and `dp2`.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts and their respective postconditions.
