The code `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. Given the initial state, we know that `fa[i]` is `fa[0] - 1`, which means `p` will be `fa[0] - 1 - 1 = fa[0] - 2`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `p` is `fa[0] - 2`, `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf')`, `dp2[-1]` is `float('inf')`, and `dp1[-1]` remains `float('inf')` if `S[i] == 'S'` does not hold true.**
