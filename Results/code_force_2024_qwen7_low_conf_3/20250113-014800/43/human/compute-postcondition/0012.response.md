Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is initialized to `n - 1`. If `S[i]` is 'S', then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`. If `S[i]` is not 'S' and instead is 'P', then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`. No other changes are made to the state of the program if the condition does not match either case.**
