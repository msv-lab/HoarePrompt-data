The code `p = fa[i] - 1` updates the value of `p` by subtracting 1 from the value of `fa[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `fa[i]` is `fa[1]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `p` is `fa[1]` - 1, `dp1[1]` is set to some value (if `S[1]` is 'S'), `dp2[1]` is set to infinity (if `S[1]` is 'P'), otherwise `S[1]` remains as not 'S' and `dp2[1]` is set to infinity.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `p` is `fa[1]` - 1, `dp1[1]` is set to some value (if `S[1]` is 'S'), `dp2[1]` is set to infinity (if `S[1]` is 'P'), otherwise `S[1]` remains as not 'S' and `dp2[1]` is set to infinity.**
