The code `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. The previous state of `p` is not relevant because it is being redefined. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `dp1`, `dp2`, and `S`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i - 1` where `i` was either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S', `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` zeros, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.**
