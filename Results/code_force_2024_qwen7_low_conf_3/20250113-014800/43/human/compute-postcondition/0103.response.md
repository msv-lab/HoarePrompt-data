Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `i - 1` where `i` was either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S'.
   - `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.
   - `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `-1` in reverse order.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented back to its original value and then decremented by 1.
   - Since `i` was either `n-1` or has been decremented until `S[i]` is not 'S', we need to ensure that the condition for the next decrement is met.

5. **New States:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (since it needs to be incremented before decrementing again).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `dp1` and `dp2` remain the same because they are not updated inside the loop but only read during each iteration.
   - `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, which does not change unless `i` changes.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`**.
