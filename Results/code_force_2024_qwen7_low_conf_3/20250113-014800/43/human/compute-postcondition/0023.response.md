The code `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S'
- `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P'
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`
- If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are both set to `float('inf')`
- If `S[i] == 'S'`, `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`
- If `S[i] == 'P'`, `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`

The value of `p` is updated to `fa[i] - 1`, and the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, if `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are both set to `float('inf')`**
