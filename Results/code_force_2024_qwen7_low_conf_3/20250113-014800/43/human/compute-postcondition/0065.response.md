Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `p` is `fa[0] - 1`.
   - If `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`.
   - `dp2[1]` is infinity.
   - `dp2[p]` is infinity.
   - `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf')`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `i = n - 1` to `i = -1` in reverse order.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`, which means `i` will become `-1`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - When `i` becomes `-1`, the loop condition `i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)` will be false because `-1` is not in the range from `n-1` down to `-1` (excluding `-1`).

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop will stop when `i` becomes `-1`, we don't need to change any values for `i` anymore.
   - However, we need to ensure the loop termination condition is correctly stated in the state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `p` is `fa[0] - 1`, if `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, and `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf')`.**
