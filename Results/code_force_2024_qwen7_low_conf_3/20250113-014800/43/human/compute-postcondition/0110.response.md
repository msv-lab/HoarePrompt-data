Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of `n + 1` where `p` is `fa[i] - 1`; `dp1[p]` is updated by adding `min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` to its current value; if `S[i] == 'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')` and `dp2[i]` remains unchanged; if `S[i] == 'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')` and `dp1[i]` remains unchanged; `dp2[p]` is updated by adding `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` to its current value**
