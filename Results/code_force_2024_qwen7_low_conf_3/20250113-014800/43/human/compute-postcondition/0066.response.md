The code `dp1[i] = float('inf')` assigns the value `float('inf')` to `dp1[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `-1`, so this line specifically updates `dp1[-1]` to `float('inf')`. 

- `n` is still greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is updated to `-1` because `dp1[i]` was assigned a new value.
- `p` remains `fa[0] - 1`.
- If `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, and `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf')`.

Since `i` is now `-1`, the condition `p != -1` does not affect `p` because `p` is not directly modified by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `p` is `fa[0] - 1`, if `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` remains `2 * dp1_value`, `dp2[1]` is infinity, `dp2[p]` is infinity, and `dp1[0]` remains `float('inf'); `dp1[-1]` is `float('inf')`**.
