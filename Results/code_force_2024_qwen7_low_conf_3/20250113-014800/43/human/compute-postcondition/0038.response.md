Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `dp1[0]` is `0` if `S[0]` is 'P'.
   - `dp2[0]` is `0` if `S[0]` is 'S'.
   - The value of `min(dp1[0], dp2[0])` is printed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by the user input, converted to an integer.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` with each iteration, `i` will increment by 1 each time the loop runs.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the user input.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0.
- To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1 (since `i` starts at 0).

Since the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the user input, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `dp1[0]` is `0` if `S[0]` is 'P', `dp2[0]` is `0` if `S[0]` is 'S', the value of `min(dp1[0], dp2[0])` is printed.**
