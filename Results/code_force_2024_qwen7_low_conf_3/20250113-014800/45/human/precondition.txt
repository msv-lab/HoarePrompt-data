t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each a_j is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^{31}; the sum of all n across all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; the function are_complementary(x, y) returns True if the i-th bit of x and y are different for all 1 ≤ i < 32, and False otherwise.
