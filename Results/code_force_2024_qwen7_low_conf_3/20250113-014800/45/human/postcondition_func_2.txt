The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then reads an integer `n` representing the length of the list `integers`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calls the function `func_2(n, integers)` to process the list and prints the result of each test case. After executing the function for all test cases, the final state of the program includes the output of `func_2(n, integers)` for each test case.
