def func_1(x, y):
    for i in range(1, 32):
        if x >> i - 1 & 1 == y >> i - 1 & 1:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{31}\), `y` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{31}\), the function returns True.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers less than \(2^{31}\). It checks whether the binary representation of `x` is identical to the binary representation of `y`. If all corresponding bits of `x` and `y` match, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through all 31 bits (from 0 to 30) of the integers `x` and `y`, comparing each bit. If any bit differs, the function immediately returns `False`. If all bits match, the function returns `True`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and integers is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_2(n, integers):
    groups = []
    for num in integers:
        placed = False
        
        for group in groups:
            if func_1(num, group[0]):
                group.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        
        if not placed:
            groups.append([num])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `groups` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers from the original `integers` list that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` when `num` is added to the group. `num` is the last integer from the `integers` list that was processed, `placed` is `True` if `num` was added to an existing group, otherwise it is `False`, and `index` is the position in the `integers` list after all integers have been processed.
    return len(groups)
    #The program returns the number of groups in the list 'groups'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer) and `integers` (a list of non-negative integers). It processes the `integers` list to form groups based on a specific condition defined by the function `func_1`. For each integer in the `integers` list, it checks whether the integer can be added to an existing group using `func_1`. If the integer can be added to an existing group, it is appended to that group; otherwise, a new group is created. After processing all integers, the function returns the total number of groups formed. Potential edge cases include empty input lists or `n` being zero, in which case no groups would be formed and the function would return 0. There is no missing functionality as per the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and integers is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^{31} for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        integers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(func_2(n, integers))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer with a value at least 1, `n` is an integer with a value at most 10^4, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the output state after each iteration of the loop is the result of `func_2(n, integers)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then reads an integer `n` representing the length of the list `integers`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calls the function `func_2(n, integers)` to process the list and prints the result of each test case. After executing the function for all test cases, the final state of the program includes the output of `func_2(n, integers)` for each test case.
