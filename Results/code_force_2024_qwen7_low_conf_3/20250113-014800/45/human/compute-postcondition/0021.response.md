The code `groups.append([num])` appends a new list containing the value of `num` to the `groups` list. This operation changes the `groups` list by adding a new inner list with `num` as its only element. The other variables (`num`, `placed`, and `index`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is now a list of lists where the last element of each inner list is an integer from the original `integers` list, `num` is an integer from the original `integers` list and it is now placed in a new group, `placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list after the last processed integer.**
