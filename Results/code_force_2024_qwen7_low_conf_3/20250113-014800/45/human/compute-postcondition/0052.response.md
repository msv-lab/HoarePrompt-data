Postcondition: ***`groups` is a list of lists, `num` is the next integer in the `integers` list, `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list after processing the next integer, `placed` is `True`, and either `group` is `[group[0], num]` (if the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` is true) or `group` remains unchanged (if the condition is false).***
