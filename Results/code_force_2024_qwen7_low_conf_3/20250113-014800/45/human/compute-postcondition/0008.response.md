The code `print(func_2(n, integers))` calls a function `func_2` with parameters `n` and `integers`. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided. Since the function `func_2` is not defined, we cannot determine what specific operations it performs on its arguments. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `integers` remain unchanged. The only change is the call to `func_2` and its result being printed.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, a value from `func_2(n, integers)` is printed.**
