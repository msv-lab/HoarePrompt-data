Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then reads an integer `n` representing the length of the list `integers`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calls the function `func_2(n, integers)` to process the list and prints the result of each test case. After executing the function for all test cases, the final state of the program includes the output of `func_2(n, integers)` for each test case.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `t` is 0, no test cases are processed, and the program terminates without printing anything.
- If the input format does not match the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of inputs or invalid integers), the program may raise an exception. However, the provided code does not handle these cases explicitly, so it assumes valid input.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not include any error handling for invalid input formats or values outside the specified ranges. If `n` exceeds \(2 \cdot 10^5\) or if the integers are out of the range \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\), the program will not enforce these constraints.
