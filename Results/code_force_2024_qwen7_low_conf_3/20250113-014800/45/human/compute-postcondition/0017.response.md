The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `groups`, `num`, `group`, and `placed`. It only breaks out of the current loop or nested structure, but no changes are made to the variables themselves.

Output State: **`groups` must have at least one element, `num` is an integer, `group` is a list containing at least three elements with the last two elements being the same (both equal to `num`), and `placed` is `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
