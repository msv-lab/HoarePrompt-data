The provided code snippet calls a function `func_2(n, integers)` and prints its return value. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the given code. Without knowing the implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact values of the variables after the code execution. Therefore, we can only state that `func_2(n, integers)` returns a value, which is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value at least 1, `n` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\) inclusive, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the output of `func_2(n, integers)` is printed**
