The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. According to the initial state, `t` is an integer with a new value after `int(input())` being at least 1, and `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` now holds the value entered via `int(input())`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value at least 1, `n` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\) inclusive**
