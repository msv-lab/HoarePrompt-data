Postcondition: ***`groups` must have at least one element, `num` is an integer, `group` is a list containing at least three elements with the last two elements being the same (both equal to `num`), and `placed` is `True`. This is ensured whether `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True` or not, as the else part does not change the conditions and we always break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
