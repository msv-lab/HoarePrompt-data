Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `groups` is a list of lists with at least one group processed.
   - `num` is the next integer in the `integers` list.
   - `not placed` is `False`.
   - `index` is the position in the `integers` list after processing the next integer.
   - `placed` is `True`.
   - The next `group` in `groups` is now `[group[0], num]` if the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` is true, otherwise `group` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for group in groups:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one group in `groups` to iterate over.
   - If `groups` is empty, the loop does not execute.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since we are starting a new iteration of the loop, we need to consider the initial state before the loop body executes.
   - The state of `num`, `not placed`, `index`, and `placed` are not relevant to the loop condition, as they are updated inside the loop body.
   - The key state to adjust is `groups`, which must contain at least one group for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `groups` is a list of lists with at least one group (this ensures the loop can execute).

Since no other specific variables need to be adjusted for the loop condition itself, we can keep the rest of the variables as they are since they will be updated within the loop body.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`groups` is a list of lists with at least one group**
