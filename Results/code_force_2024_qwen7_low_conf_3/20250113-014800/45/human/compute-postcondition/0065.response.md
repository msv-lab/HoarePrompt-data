`groups.append([num])` appends a new list containing the value of `num` to the `groups` list. The value of `num` is the next integer in the `integers` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `groups` now includes a new sublist with the value of `num`.

Output State: **`groups` is a list of lists, with the new sublist `[num]` appended; `num` is the next integer in the `integers` list; `not placed` is `False`; `index` is the position in the `integers` list after processing the next integer; `placed` is `False`.**
