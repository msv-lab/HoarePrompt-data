`placed` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The value of `groups` and `num` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `groups` is a list of lists with at least one group, `num` is appended to the list `group`, and `placed` is `True`.

Output State: **`groups` is a list of lists with at least one group, `num` is appended to the list `group`, and `placed` is `True`**
