The function `func_3` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, it appears that the function might internally use or manipulate variables `t`, `n`, and `integers` (a list of integers). 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\),
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\),
- `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq n\), and
- The sum of `n` over all test cases in a test does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\),

the function likely processes these inputs to produce an output.

Since the output is not specified directly in the given information, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints as follows:

The functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept and process the parameters `t`, `n`, and `integers` (even though they are not explicitly passed as function arguments).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `integers`, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq n\).**
