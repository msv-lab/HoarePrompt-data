Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer) and `integers` (a list of non-negative integers). It processes the `integers` list to form groups based on a specific condition defined by the function `func_1`. For each integer in the `integers` list, it checks whether the integer can be added to an existing group using `func_1`. If the integer can be added to an existing group, it is appended to that group; otherwise, a new group is created. After processing all integers, the function returns the total number of groups formed. Potential edge cases include empty input lists or `n` being zero, in which case no groups would be formed and the function would return 0. There is no missing functionality as per the provided code.**
