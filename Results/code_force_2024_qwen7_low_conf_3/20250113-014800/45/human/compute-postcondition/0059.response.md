The code snippet `group.append(num)` adds the value of `num` to the list `group`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `group` or the value of `num`, we can only say that `num` is appended to the existing list `group`.

Output State: **`groups` is a list of lists with at least one group, and `num` is appended to the list `group`.**
