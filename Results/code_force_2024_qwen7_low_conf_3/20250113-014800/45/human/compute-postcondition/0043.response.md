The code `groups.append([num])` appends a new list containing only the value of `num` to the `groups` list. This means that a new inner list is created with `num` as its only element and this new list is added to `groups`.

- `num` is an integer from the original `integers` list.
- `groups` was initially a list of lists where the last element of each inner list was an integer from the original `integers` list.
- After appending `[num]` to `groups`, `groups` now contains an additional inner list with `num` as its only element.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `not placed` is `False`.
- `index` is the position in the `integers` list after all integers have been processed.
- `placed` remains `False` because `num` is not placed in any group.
- `group` remains unchanged because no group satisfied the condition `func_1(num, group[0])`.

Output State: **`groups` is now a list of lists where the last element of each inner list is an integer from the original `integers` list, and it includes a new inner list `[num]`; `num` is an integer from the original `integers` list; `not placed` is `False`; `index` is the position in the `integers` list after all integers have been processed; `placed` remains `False`; `group` remains unchanged.**
