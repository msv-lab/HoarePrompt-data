Postcondition: **`groups` is a list of lists, `num` is the next integer from the `integers` list starting from the `index` position, `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the new position in the `integers` list before the next processed integer, `placed` is `True`, `group` is now the next group in the list `groups` containing its original elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or control structure.**
