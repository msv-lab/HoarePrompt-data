Postcondition: ***`groups` is a list of lists where the last element of each inner list is an integer from the original `integers` list, `num` is an integer from the original `integers` list and it is placed in either the first group in `groups` or remains unplaced, depending on the result of `func_1(num, group[0])`. `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list before the next processed integer, `placed` is `True` if `num` is added to the first group, otherwise it remains `False`, `group` is now the first group in the list `groups` containing its original elements plus `num` if `num` is added to this group.***
