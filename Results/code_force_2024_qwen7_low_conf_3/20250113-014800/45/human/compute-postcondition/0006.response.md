`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input. The list `integers` is not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
