The code `integers = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in the list `integers`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer with a value at least 1, `n` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\) inclusive, and `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value at least 1, `n` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\) inclusive, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
