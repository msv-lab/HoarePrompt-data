Postcondition: **`groups` is a list of lists where the last element of each inner list is an integer from the original `integers` list, `num` is an integer from the original `integers` list and it is added to one of the groups in `groups` or remains unplaced if no group satisfies the condition of `func_1(num, group[0])`. `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list after all integers have been processed, `placed` is `True` if `num` is added to a group, otherwise it remains `False`, `group` is the group to which `num` is added if the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` is satisfied, otherwise `group` remains unchanged. Since `(not placed)` is true, `num` is not placed in any group, and `placed` remains `False`.**
