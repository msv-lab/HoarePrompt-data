The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `integers`, which is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). After executing the function body, the function returns the number of groups in the list 'groups'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `integers`, and return the number of groups in the list 'groups'.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (a positive integer) and a parameter `integers` (a list of non-negative integers), and returns the number of groups in the list 'groups'.**
