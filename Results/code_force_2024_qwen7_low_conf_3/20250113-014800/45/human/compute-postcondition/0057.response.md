Postcondition: ***`groups` is a list of lists with at least one group processed, `num` is the next integer in the `integers` list, `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list after processing the next integer, `placed` is `True`, and the next `group` in `groups` is now `[group[0], num]` if the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` is true, otherwise `group` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
