The code `integers = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `integers`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.

Given that `t` is an integer with a value of 1 and `n` is an input integer, the specific value of `t` is retained, and `n` remains as an input integer. After executing the code, the `integers` variable now holds a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
