Postcondition: ***`groups` is a list of lists with at least one group. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`, then `num` is appended to the list `group`, and `placed` is set to `True`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
