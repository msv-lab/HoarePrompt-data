The function `func_2(n, integers)` is called and its result is printed, but the definition of `func_2` is not provided. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact values of the variables after the function call. However, we can list the impact of the code on the program.

- `n` remains an input integer.
- `integers` remains a list of input integers.
- `t` remains 0 because it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Since `func_2(n, integers)` is called and its result is printed, the output state includes the result of this function call. However, since the function's implementation is not specified, we cannot specify the exact value of the output.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of input integers, the output is the result of `func_2(n, integers)`**
