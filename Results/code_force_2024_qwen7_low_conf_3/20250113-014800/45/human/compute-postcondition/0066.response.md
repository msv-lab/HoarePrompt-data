Postcondition: ***`groups` is a list of lists. If `num` is placed in any group (i.e., `placed` is `True`), then `placed` remains `True` and either the new sublist `[num]` is appended to `groups` if no group already contains `num`, or a group is updated such that `group[1]` is replaced by `num` if `func_1(num, group[0])` is true. If `num` is not placed in any group (i.e., `placed` remains `False`), then the new sublist `[num]` is appended to `groups`. In both cases, the rest of the `groups` remain unchanged.***
