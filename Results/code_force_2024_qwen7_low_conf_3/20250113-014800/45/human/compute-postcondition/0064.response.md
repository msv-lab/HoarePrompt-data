Postcondition: **`groups` is a list of lists, `num` is the next integer in the `integers` list, `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list after processing the next integer, `placed` is `False`, and for each group `group` in `groups`: if `placed` is `False` for that group, then `group` remains unchanged.**
