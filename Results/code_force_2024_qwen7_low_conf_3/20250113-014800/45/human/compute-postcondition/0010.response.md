The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list `integers` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
