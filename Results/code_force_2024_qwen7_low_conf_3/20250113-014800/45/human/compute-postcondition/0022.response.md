Postcondition: ***`groups` is a list of lists where the last element of each inner list is an integer from the original `integers` list. `num` is an integer from the original `integers` list and it is now placed in a new group if the condition `not placed` is met. If `not placed`, `placed` is `True`, indicating that `num` has been successfully placed in a group. If `placed` remains `False`, `num` is not yet placed in any group. `index` is the position in the `integers` list after the last processed integer.***
