Postcondition: ***`groups` is a list of lists where the last element of each inner list is an integer from the original `integers` list, `num` is an integer from the original `integers` list, `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list after all integers have been processed, `placed` is `False` if no group satisfies the condition of `func_1(num, group[0])`, otherwise it is `True` and `num` is added to a new inner list `[num]` in the corresponding group, `group` is the group to which `num` is added if the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` is satisfied, otherwise `group` remains unchanged.***
