The code snippet takes a list of integers from user input and converts it into a list using `map` and `int`. The original values of `t` and `n` are not used in this process, so they remain unchanged. However, the value of `integers` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.

Let's assume the input is a space-separated list of integers, e.g., "4 5 6". The code will convert this into a list of integers: `[4, 5, 6]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is [input integers]**
