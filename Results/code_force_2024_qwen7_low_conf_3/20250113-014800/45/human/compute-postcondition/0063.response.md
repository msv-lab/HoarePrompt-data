Output State: **`groups` is a list of lists, `num` is the next integer in the `integers` list, `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list after processing the next integer, `placed` is `True` if any `num` was placed in a group, and for each group `group` in `groups`: if `placed` is `True` for that group, then `group` is `[group[0], num]` (if the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` is true) or `group` remains unchanged (if the condition is false). If no `num` was placed in any group, then `placed` is still `False`.**
