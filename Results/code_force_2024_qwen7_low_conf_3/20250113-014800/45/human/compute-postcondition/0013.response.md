Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value at least 1, `n` is an integer with a value at most 10^4, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the output state after each iteration of the loop is the result of `func_2(n, integers)`.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq n\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - In each iteration, `n` is updated to an integer input.
   - `integers` is updated to a list of integers based on the input.
   - `func_2(n, integers)` is called and its output is printed.

3. **Final Iteration Analysis**:
   - After the loop completes, the final value of `t` will be 0 (since `t` decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0).
   - Each time `t` is non-zero, `n` and `integers` will be updated based on user input.
   - Therefore, the final state will be determined by the last valid iteration of the loop where `t > 0`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - `t` will be 0.
   - `n` will be the value of `n` from the last iteration of the loop.
   - `integers` will be the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop.

5. **Output State**:
   - Since the loop will stop when `t` becomes 0, the final output state is characterized by the state right before `t` becomes 0.
   - The output state after all iterations is the result of `func_2(n, integers)` for the last valid iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value at least 1, `n` is an integer with a value at most 10^4, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the output state after each iteration of the loop is the result of `func_2(n, integers)`.**
