Postcondition: ***`groups` is a list of lists where the second element of each inner list is an integer from the original `integers` list, `num` is an integer from the original `integers` list and it is added to the second group in `groups`. `not placed` is `False`, `index` is the position in the `integers` list before the next processed integer, `placed` is `True`, `group` is now the second group in the list `groups` containing its original elements plus `num`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
