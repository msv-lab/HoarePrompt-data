### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to group numbers such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits. The solution uses two functions to achieve this.
   
2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function checks if two numbers `x` and `y` differ in all their bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. It iterates through each bit position from 1 to 31 and checks if the corresponding bits are the same. If any two bits are the same, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function groups the numbers into the minimum number of groups required. It initializes an empty list `groups`. For each number in the input list, it tries to add the number to an existing group where the number's bits do not match the bits of the group's representative number. If no such group exists, it creates a new group with the current number.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function reads the input, which consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_2` to determine the minimum number of groups needed and prints the result.

### Verification:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: The logic correctly checks each bit from 1 to 31. If any two bits are the same, it immediately returns `False`. If all bits are different, it returns `True`. This ensures that the function accurately checks the condition for grouping.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The function correctly iterates through each number and attempts to place it in an existing group where the bits do not match. If no such group exists, it creates a new group. The logic ensures that the groups are formed according to the problem's requirements.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_2` and printing the result. The logic is sound and handles the input format as specified.

Given that the functions are logically correct and meet the problem's requirements, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
