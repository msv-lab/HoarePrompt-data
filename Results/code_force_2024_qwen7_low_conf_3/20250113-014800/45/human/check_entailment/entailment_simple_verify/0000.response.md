### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks whether two numbers `x` and `y` have the same bit at any position from 1 to 31. If they do, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - The function correctly implements the bit comparison logic. It uses bitwise operations (`>>` and `&`) to extract the i-th bit of both numbers and compare them.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function groups the integers such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit in any of the 31 least significant bits.
   - The function iterates through each number and attempts to add it to an existing group where the bit condition is satisfied. If no such group is found, it creates a new group.
   - The logic ensures that the bit condition is maintained across all groups, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_3` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input for multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_2`, and prints the result for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the input reading and processing logic as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The program correctly groups the integers based on the bit condition and outputs the minimum number of groups required.
   - The annotated code aligns with the programâ€™s intended behavior, validating that the logic is implemented correctly.

5. **Test Cases Verification**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified the test cases and verified that the program handles them accurately. The provided examples show that the program correctly groups the integers based on the bit condition.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification of the code, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The annotated code confirms the intended behavior of the functions, and the test cases provided support the correctness of the solution.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
