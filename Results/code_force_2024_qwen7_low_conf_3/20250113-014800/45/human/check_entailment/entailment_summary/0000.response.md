Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of dividing a set of integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in their 31 least significant bits. Let's analyze each component of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if two integers have different bits in their binary representations at every bit position from 1 to 31.
   - It returns `True` if the bits are different and `False` if there is any matching bit.
   - The logic correctly checks each bit position to ensure no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function forms groups of integers such that no two integers in the same group have matching bits.
   - It iterates through each integer, trying to add it to an existing group where it doesn't violate the condition (using `func_1`).
   - If it cannot be added to any existing group, it creates a new group.
   - The function correctly ensures that the condition is met for each integer and forms the minimal number of groups.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function handles the overall structure of reading multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n` integers and uses `func_2` to compute the minimum number of groups required.
   - The function correctly processes each test case and prints the result.

Given the descriptions and the logical correctness of each function, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. The logic is sound, and there are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**
