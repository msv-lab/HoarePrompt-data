Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks whether two numbers differ in all their corresponding bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. It returns `False` if there exists any bit position where the bits of `x` and `y` are the same, otherwise it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function takes a list of integers and groups them such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits. It iterates through each number and tries to place it in an existing group where the bit condition is satisfied. If no such group is found, it creates a new group for the number.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input for multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_2`, and prints the result for each test case.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness of the program, consider various test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `[1, 4, 3, 4]`
  - The program correctly groups these numbers into 4 separate groups since no two numbers can share the same bit in all positions.
  
- **Test Case 2**: `[0, 2147483647]`
  - These numbers will be in the same group because their 31st bit is different.

- **Test Case 3**: `[476319172, 261956880, 2136179468, 1671164475, 1885526767]`
  - The program will create 3 groups because these numbers cannot all be paired without violating the bit condition.

- **Test Case 4**: `[1335890506, 811593141, 1128223362]`
  - These numbers will form 2 groups because the third number can be placed in the same group as the first two.

- **Test Case 5**: `[688873446, 627404104, 1520079543, 1458610201]`
  - These numbers will form 2 groups because the fourth number can be placed in the same group as the first three.

- **Test Case 6**: `[61545621, 2085938026, 1269342732, 1430258575]`
  - These numbers will form 3 groups because none of the numbers can be placed together without violating the bit condition.

- **Test Case 7**: `[0, 0, 2147483647, 2147483647]`
  - The program correctly places these numbers into 3 groups.

- **Test Case 8**: `[1858058912, 289424735, 1858058912, 2024818580, 1858058912, 289424735, 122665067, 289424735]`
  - These numbers will form 4 groups.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to handle all the edge cases and conditions described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
