Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if two numbers have matching bits in their binary representations for the first 31 bits. It iterates through the bits of the numbers and returns `False` as soon as it finds a pair of matching bits. If it completes the loop without finding any matching bits, it returns `True`. This function meets the requirement of determining if two numbers can be in the same group.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly implements the logic to partition the list of integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in their binary representations. It uses the `func_1` function to check if a number can be added to an existing group. If it cannot be added to any existing group, it creates a new group. The function returns the total number of groups required, which is the minimum number of groups needed to satisfy the condition.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function handles the overall structure of reading multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers. It then calls `func_2` with these inputs and prints the result. This function ensures that the entire process is repeated for each test case as specified in the problem statement.

Given the detailed explanations above, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. All functions work together to ensure that the numbers are grouped appropriately and the minimum number of groups is determined.

Correctness: **True**
