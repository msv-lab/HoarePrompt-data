### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: The function correctly checks if two numbers `x` and `y` differ in all their bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. The logic iterates through each bit position from 1 to 31 and checks if the corresponding bits are the same. If any two bits are the same, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This logic is accurate and ensures that the function accurately checks the condition for grouping.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The function correctly groups the numbers into the minimum number of groups required. It initializes an empty list `groups`. For each number in the input list, it tries to add the number to an existing group where the number's bits do not match the bits of the group's representative number. If no such group exists, it creates a new group with the current number. However, there is a potential issue here: the function only checks the first bit of the group's representative number (`group[0]`) when deciding if a number should be added to a group. This means that if two numbers differ in more than one bit, they might end up in the same group, which violates the problem's requirement.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: The function correctly reads the input, which consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_2` to determine the minimum number of groups needed and prints the result. The logic is sound and handles the input format as specified.

### Verification:

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The core issue lies in the fact that `func_2` only checks the first bit of the group's representative number when deciding if a number should be added to a group. This is insufficient because the problem requires checking all 31 bits. To ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits, we need to check the entire 31-bit representation. Therefore, the function is not correctly implemented and will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

### Example Counter-Example:

Consider the following test case:
```
2
2
1 2
```

- `func_2` will create a single group containing both `1` and `2` because `func_1(1, 2)` returns `True` (since they differ in the first bit).
- However, the correct answer should be `2` because `1` and `2` should be in separate groups since they have matching bits in the second bit (both have a `1` in the second bit).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to group numbers such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
