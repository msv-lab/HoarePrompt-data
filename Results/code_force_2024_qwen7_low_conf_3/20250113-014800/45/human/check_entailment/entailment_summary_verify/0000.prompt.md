You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    for i in range(1, 32):
        if x >> i - 1 & 1 == y >> i - 1 & 1:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, integers):
    groups = []
    for num in integers:
        placed = False
        for group in groups:
            if func_1(num, group[0]):
                group.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            groups.append([num])
    return len(groups)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        integers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(func_2(n, integers))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then reads an integer `n` representing the length of the list `integers`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calls the function `func_2(n, integers)` to process the list and prints the result of each test case. After executing the function for all test cases, the final state of the program includes the output of `func_2(n, integers)` for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks whether two numbers differ in all their corresponding bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. It returns `False` if there exists any bit position where the bits of `x` and `y` are the same, otherwise it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function takes a list of integers and groups them such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits. It iterates through each number and tries to place it in an existing group where the bit condition is satisfied. If no such group is found, it creates a new group for the number.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input for multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_2`, and prints the result for each test case.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness of the program, consider various test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `[1, 4, 3, 4]`
  - The program correctly groups these numbers into 4 separate groups since no two numbers can share the same bit in all positions.
  
- **Test Case 2**: `[0, 2147483647]`
  - These numbers will be in the same group because their 31st bit is different.

- **Test Case 3**: `[476319172, 261956880, 2136179468, 1671164475, 1885526767]`
  - The program will create 3 groups because these numbers cannot all be paired without violating the bit condition.

- **Test Case 4**: `[1335890506, 811593141, 1128223362]`
  - These numbers will form 2 groups because the third number can be placed in the same group as the first two.

- **Test Case 5**: `[688873446, 627404104, 1520079543, 1458610201]`
  - These numbers will form 2 groups because the fourth number can be placed in the same group as the first three.

- **Test Case 6**: `[61545621, 2085938026, 1269342732, 1430258575]`
  - These numbers will form 3 groups because none of the numbers can be placed together without violating the bit condition.

- **Test Case 7**: `[0, 0, 2147483647, 2147483647]`
  - The program correctly places these numbers into 3 groups.

- **Test Case 8**: `[1858058912, 289424735, 1858058912, 2024818580, 1858058912, 289424735, 122665067, 289424735]`
  - These numbers will form 4 groups.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to handle all the edge cases and conditions described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
