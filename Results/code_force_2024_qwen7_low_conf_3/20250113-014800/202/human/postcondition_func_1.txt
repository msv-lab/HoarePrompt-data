The function `func_2` accepts a binary string `s` as input and computes the length of `s` minus the last element of its KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) table. The KMP table is generated by the `func_1` function, which preprocesses the string `s`. After executing, the function returns the integer value `n - pi[-1]`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `pi` is the KMP table of `s`. The function handles the case where the length of the string `s` is within the range `[1, 2 * 10^5]`. No edge cases are explicitly mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes valid input and does not handle cases where `s` might be empty or contain characters other than '0' and '1'.
