Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Processing**: For each binary string \(s\), the program iterates through each character and maintains a running count `cur`. This count is adjusted based on whether the current character matches the expected parity (even or odd index):
   - If the character matches the expected parity, `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1.
3. **Tracking Min and Max Values**: The program keeps track of the minimum (`mn`) and maximum (`mx`) values of the running count `cur` during the iteration. These values help determine the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding.
4. **Output Calculation**: After processing the entire string, the program calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the running count, which corresponds to the minimum length of the folded strip.

Given the logic and the execution summary, the program should produce the correct output for each test case based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
