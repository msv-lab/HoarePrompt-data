You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a strip of paper with a binary string s of length n . You can fold
the paper in between any pair of adjacent digits.

A set of folds is considered valid if after the folds, all characters that are
on top of or below each other match. Note that all folds are made at the same
time, so the characters don't have to match in between folds.

For example, these are valid foldings of s = \mathtt{110110110011} and s =
\mathtt{01110} :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a961dc7cc221603a7d5a488247ba5439ce7444da.png)

The length of the folded strip is the length seen from above after all folds
are made. So for the two above examples, after the folds shown above, the
lengths would be 7 and 3 , respectively.

Notice that for the above folding of s = \mathtt{01110} , if we made either of
the two folds on their own, that would not be a valid folding. However,
because we don't check for validity until all folds are made, this folding is
valid.

After performing a set of valid folds, what is the minimum length strip you
can form?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the size of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters '0' and
'1' — a description of the digits on the strip.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible length of
the strip after a valid folding.

    01110
    
    4
    
    1111
    
    2
    
    01

Output

    3
    1
    3
    3
    1
    2
    
Note

For the first example case, one optimal folding is to fold the strip in the
middle, which produces a strip of length 3.

The third and fourth example cases correspond to the images above. Note that
the folding shown above for s = \mathtt{110110110011} is not of minimal
length.

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and s is a binary string of length n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        mn = 0
        
        mx = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for c in s:
            if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
                cur = cur + 1
            else:
                cur = cur - 1
            mn = min(mn, cur)
            mx = max(mx, cur)
        
        print(mx - mn)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer read from input, `s` is a binary string of length `n` read from input, `cur` is an integer that is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and the printed value is `mx - mn`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(t\) representing the number of binary strings to process, followed by \(t\) pairs of integers \(n\) and a binary string \(s\) of length \(n\). For each binary string, the function calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a running count `cur`. The running count `cur` increments by 1 if the current character in the binary string matches the parity of its index, otherwise it decrements by 1. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, with each binary string having a length between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and ensures that the total length of all strings does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
