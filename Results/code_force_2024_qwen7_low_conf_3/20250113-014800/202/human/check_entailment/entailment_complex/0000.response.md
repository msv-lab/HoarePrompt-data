Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of the strip after valid folding. A valid folding means that after folding, all characters on top of or below each other must match.
2. The annotated program describes a function `func_1()` that processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer \(n\) and a binary string \(s\) of length \(n\).
3. The function maintains a running count `cur` initialized to 0. For each character in the binary string:
   - If the current character matches the expected parity (even/odd index), `cur` is incremented.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is decremented.
4. `mn` keeps track of the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the iteration, while `mx` keeps track of the maximum value of `cur`.
5. After processing all characters in the string, the length of the folded strip is calculated as `mx - mn`.

To validate correctness:
- The approach correctly tracks the parity differences across the string.
- The minimum and maximum values of the running count help in determining the minimum possible length of the folded strip.
- The logic accounts for valid folds where all matching characters end up on top of each other.

Given the problem requirements and the implementation details, the provided function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
