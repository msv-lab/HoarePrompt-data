You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a strip of paper with a binary string s of length n . You can fold
the paper in between any pair of adjacent digits.

A set of folds is considered valid if after the folds, all characters that are
on top of or below each other match. Note that all folds are made at the same
time, so the characters don't have to match in between folds.

For example, these are valid foldings of s = \mathtt{110110110011} and s =
\mathtt{01110} :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a961dc7cc221603a7d5a488247ba5439ce7444da.png)

The length of the folded strip is the length seen from above after all folds
are made. So for the two above examples, after the folds shown above, the
lengths would be 7 and 3 , respectively.

Notice that for the above folding of s = \mathtt{01110} , if we made either of
the two folds on their own, that would not be a valid folding. However,
because we don't check for validity until all folds are made, this folding is
valid.

After performing a set of valid folds, what is the minimum length strip you
can form?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the size of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters '0' and
'1' — a description of the digits on the strip.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible length of
the strip after a valid folding.

Example

Input

    6
    
    6
    
    101101
    
    1
    
    0
    
    12
    
    110110110011
    
    5
    
    01110
    
    4
    
    1111
    
    2
    
    01

Output

    3
    1
    3
    3
    1
    2
    
Note

For the first example case, one optimal folding is to fold the strip in the
middle, which produces a strip of length 3.

The third and fourth example cases correspond to the images above. Note that
the folding shown above for s = \mathtt{110110110011} is not of minimal
length.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        mn = 0
        mx = 0
        cur = 0
        for c in s:
            if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
                cur = cur + 1
            else:
                cur = cur - 1
            mn = min(mn, cur)
            mx = max(mx, cur)
        print(mx - mn)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
