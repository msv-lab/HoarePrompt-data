Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, let's break down its logic and compare it against the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `mn` (minimum count) and `mx` (maximum count) to 0.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
     - If the current count `cur` is even and the character is '1', or if the current count `cur` is odd and the character is '0', it increments `cur` by 1.
     - Otherwise, it decrements `cur` by 1.
     - It updates `mn` to the minimum value between `mn` and `cur`.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum value between `mx` and `cur`.
   - Finally, it prints `mx - mn`, which represents the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding.

2. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The idea behind the logic is to simulate the folding process by maintaining a running count (`cur`) of the difference between the number of '1's and '0's encountered so far.
   - When `cur` changes sign, it means that there is a valid folding point where the sequence of '1's and '0's matches above and below the fold.
   - The minimum possible length of the strip is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur` because these represent the points where the strip could potentially be folded to minimize its length.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same ('0' or '1'), the minimum length will be 1, which is correctly handled by the logic.
   - If the string is alternating ('0101...'), the minimum length will also be 1, which is correctly handled by the logic.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the example `s = "101101"`, the program calculates the counts and outputs `3` as the minimum length, which is correct.
   - For `s = "01110"`, the program calculates the counts and outputs `1` as the minimum length, which is correct.
   - For `s = "110110110011"`, the program calculates the counts and outputs `3` as the minimum length, which is correct.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding.

Correctness: **True**
