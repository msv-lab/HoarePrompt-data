You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a strip of paper with a binary string s of length n . You can fold
the paper in between any pair of adjacent digits.

A set of folds is considered valid if after the folds, all characters that are
on top of or below each other match. Note that all folds are made at the same
time, so the characters don't have to match in between folds.

For example, these are valid foldings of s = \mathtt{110110110011} and s =
\mathtt{01110} :

The length of the folded strip is the length seen from above after all folds
are made. So for the two above examples, after the folds shown above, the
lengths would be 7 and 3 , respectively.

Notice that for the above folding of s = \mathtt{01110} , if we made either of
the two folds on their own, that would not be a valid folding. However,
because we don't check for validity until all folds are made, this folding is
valid.

After performing a set of valid folds, what is the minimum length strip you
can form?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the size of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters '0' and
'1' — a description of the digits on the strip.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible length of
the strip after a valid folding.

Output

    3
    1

Note

For the first example case, one optimal folding is to fold the strip in the
middle, which produces a strip of length 3.

The third and fourth example cases correspond to the images above. Note that
the folding shown above for s = \mathtt{110110110011} is not of minimal
length.

- Program:

    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        mn = 0
        mx = 0
        cur = 0
        for c in s:
            if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
                cur = cur + 1
            else:
                cur = cur - 1
            mn = min(mn, cur)
            mx = max(mx, cur)
        print(mx - mn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(t\) representing the number of binary strings to process, followed by \(t\) pairs of integers \(n\) and a binary string \(s\) of length \(n\). For each binary string, the function calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a running count `cur`. The running count `cur` increments by 1 if the current character in the binary string matches the parity of its index, otherwise it decrements by 1. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, with each binary string having a length between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and ensures that the total length of all strings does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, let's break down its logic and compare it against the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `mn` (minimum count) and `mx` (maximum count) to 0.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
     - If the current count `cur` is even and the character is '1', or if the current count `cur` is odd and the character is '0', it increments `cur` by 1.
     - Otherwise, it decrements `cur` by 1.
     - It updates `mn` to the minimum value between `mn` and `cur`.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum value between `mx` and `cur`.
   - Finally, it prints `mx - mn`, which represents the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding.

2. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The idea behind the logic is to simulate the folding process by maintaining a running count (`cur`) of the difference between the number of '1's and '0's encountered so far.
   - When `cur` changes sign, it means that there is a valid folding point where the sequence of '1's and '0's matches above and below the fold.
   - The minimum possible length of the strip is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur` because these represent the points where the strip could potentially be folded to minimize its length.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same ('0' or '1'), the minimum length will be 1, which is correctly handled by the logic.
   - If the string is alternating ('0101...'), the minimum length will also be 1, which is correctly handled by the logic.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the example `s = "101101"`, the program calculates the counts and outputs `3` as the minimum length, which is correct.
   - For `s = "01110"`, the program calculates the counts and outputs `1` as the minimum length, which is correct.
   - For `s = "110110110011"`, the program calculates the counts and outputs `3` as the minimum length, which is correct.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding.
