The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(t\) representing the number of binary strings to process, followed by \(t\) pairs of integers \(n\) and a binary string \(s\) of length \(n\). For each binary string, the function calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a running count `cur`. The running count `cur` increments by 1 if the current character in the binary string matches the parity of its index, otherwise it decrements by 1. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, with each binary string having a length between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and ensures that the total length of all strings does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
