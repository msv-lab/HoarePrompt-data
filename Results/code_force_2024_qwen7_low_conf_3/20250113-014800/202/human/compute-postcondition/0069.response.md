The code snippet updates the variable `mn` to be the minimum between the current value of `mn` and the current value of `cur`. Since no specific values for `mn` and `cur` are given in the initial state, we need to consider the general behavior of this operation.

- `mn` will take the minimum value between its current value and `cur`.
- `cur` remains unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `cur` is updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.

The condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')` implies that `cur` is incremented by 1 if `cur % 2 == 0` and `c == '1'` or if `cur % 2 != 0` and `c != '1'`, and decremented by 1 otherwise. However, since `t` is greater than 0 and no specific value for `t` or `c` is given, `cur` could be either incremented or decremented based on the value of `c`.

Since the exact value of `cur` is not specified, the only thing we can definitively say is that `mn` will be updated to be the minimum between its current value and the new value of `cur`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is greater than 0, `cur` is updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, `mn` is the minimum between its current value and the new value of `cur`.**
