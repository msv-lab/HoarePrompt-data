Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - If `(cur % 2 == c == '1')` is true, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and `c` remains not equal to `'1'`. Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1 and `c` does not satisfy the condition `(cur % 2 == c == '1')`.

2. **Code Snippet**: 
   ```python
   mn = min(mn, cur)
   ```

3. **Impact of the Code**:
   - This line of code assigns the minimum value between `mn` and `cur` to `mn`.
   - The value of `cur` remains unchanged by this line of code.
   - The value of `mn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cur`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only thing that changes is the value of `mn`. The output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`**.
