`cur` is decremented by 1. The value of `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`, and the value of `mx` is the maximum of its original value (if defined) and the new value of `cur`. Since `cur` was originally `mn` or greater and `mx` or less, the new value of `cur` (which is `cur - 1`) will be less than both `mx` and greater than `mn`. Therefore, the new value of `mn` will be the minimum of the original `mn` and `cur - 1`, and the new value of `mx` will be the maximum of the original `mx` and `cur - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is `mn - 1`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur - 1`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1`**
