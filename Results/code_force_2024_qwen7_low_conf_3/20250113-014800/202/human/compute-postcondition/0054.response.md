Let's go through this step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `s` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.
   - `cur` is either 3, -1, 1, or -3, depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.
   - `mn` is either -1 or -2.

2. Code Snippet:
   ```python
   mx = max(mx, cur)
   ```

3. Analysis:
   - `mx` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be considered as `None` initially.
   - The code assigns the maximum value between `mx` (which is `None` initially) and `cur` to `mx`.

4. Calculating the Result:
   - Since `mx` is `None`, the maximum between `None` and `cur` is simply `cur`.
   - Therefore, `mx` will take the value of `cur`.

Given that `cur` can be either 3, -1, 1, or -3, the value of `mx` will be one of these four values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `cur` is either 3, -1, 1, or -3, depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, `mn` is either -1 or -2, `mx` is the same as `cur`.**
