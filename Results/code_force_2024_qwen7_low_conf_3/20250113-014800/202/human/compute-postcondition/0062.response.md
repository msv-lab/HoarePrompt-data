The code initializes `cur` to 0. This means the current value of `cur` is set to 0, and since no other operations are performed on `cur`, its value remains 0. The states of the other variables (`s`, `mx`, `mn`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `cur` is 0, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer.**
