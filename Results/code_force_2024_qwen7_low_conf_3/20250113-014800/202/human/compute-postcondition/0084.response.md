The code `print(mx - mn)` does not change any variables but simply prints the difference between `mx` and `mn`. Given the initial state:

- `s` is an empty string
- `t` is greater than 0
- `cur` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the length of the input string `s` is even or odd
- `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop
- `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop

Since no variables are modified in the code, their values remain unchanged. The output of the program will be the value of `mx - mn`.

To determine `mx - mn`, we need to consider the possible values of `mx` and `mn`. Since `cur` can only be 0 or 1, the possible values for both `mx` and `mn` are also limited to 0 or 1. There are two scenarios:

1. If `mx` is 1 and `mn` is 0, then `mx - mn` is 1.
2. If `mx` and `mn` are both 0 or both 1, then `mx - mn` is 0.

Without additional information about the specific sequence of `cur` values during the loop, we cannot determine a specific value for `mx - mn`. However, we can state the possible outcomes.

Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `t` is greater than 0, `cur` is either 0 or 1, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and the output is either 0 or 1.**
