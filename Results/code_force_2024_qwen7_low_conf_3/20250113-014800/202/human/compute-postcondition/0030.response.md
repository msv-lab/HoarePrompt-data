`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `mx`, `mn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer that is either `mn + k` or `mn - k`, `mx` is `mn + 2 * |k|`, `mn` is `mn - 2 * |k|`, `n` is an input integer**
