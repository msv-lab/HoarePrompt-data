The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Given that `cur` is either 2 or -2, incrementing it by 1 changes its value to 3 or -1 respectively. The values of the other variables (`s`, `mx`, `n`, and `mn`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `cur` is either 3 or -1, `mx` is either 2 or 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, `mn` is either -1 or -2**
