You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the given code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For each character, it updates the `cur` variable based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.

- If `cur % 2 == 0` is true and `c == '1'` is true, or both are false, `cur` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1.

After each iteration, `cur` is updated, and `mn` and `mx` are updated to track the minimum and maximum values of `cur` seen so far.

### Output State After All Iterations

Let's consider the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

1. **String `s`**: The string `s` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `cur`, `mn`, and `mx`.
2. **Variable `cur`**: `cur` will end up being the final value it attains after processing all characters in `s`. Based on the loop logic, `cur` can be any even number if the sequence of characters leads to an even number of flips (from even to odd or vice versa), and it can be any odd number if the sequence leads to an odd number of flips.
3. **Variable `mn`**: `mn` keeps track of the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop. After all iterations, `mn` will be the smallest value `cur` has taken.
4. **Variable `mx`**: `mx` keeps track of the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop. After all iterations, `mx` will be the largest value `cur` has taken.
5. **Variable `n`**: The variable `n` remains unchanged and retains its original value from the initial state.

### Conclusion

Given the loop's behavior and the constraints, we can summarize the final output state as follows:

**Output State:**
`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer representing the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `n` is the input integer from the initial state.

Thus, the output state is:
```
`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `n` is an input integer.
```
```
print(mx - mn)

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
