`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are only defined within the subsequent blocks of code. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2⋅10^5` remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `s` is a binary string of length n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `t` is set to an input integer.**
