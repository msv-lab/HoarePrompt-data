The code snippet `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates the value of `mn` to be the minimum between its current value and `cur`. Given the initial state, `mn` is either -1 (if `c` is not '1') or -1 (if `c` is '1'), and `cur` is either 2 (if `c` is '1') or -2 (if `c` is not '1'). In both cases, `cur` will be less than `mn`, so `mn` will be updated to the value of `cur`.

- If `c` is '1', `cur` is 2 and `mn` is -1. After the operation, `mn` will be -1 (since -1 is less than 2).
- If `c` is not '1', `cur` is -2 and `mn` is -1. After the operation, `mn` will be -2 (since -2 is less than -1).

The states of the other variables (`s`, `cur`, `mx`, `n`) are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either 2 or -2, `mx` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, `mn` is either -1 or -2**
