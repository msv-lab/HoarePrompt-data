The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `cur`. The value of `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 1. Therefore, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 1.
- `mx` is the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.
- `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.

After executing the code, `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 1, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`, and `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.**
