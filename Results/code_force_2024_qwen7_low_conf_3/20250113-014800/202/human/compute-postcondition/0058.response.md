The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer value from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `s`, `cur`, `mx`, `mn`, and `t`. Therefore, the only change is that `n` is now assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer**
