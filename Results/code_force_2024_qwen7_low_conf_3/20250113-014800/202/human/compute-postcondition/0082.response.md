The code snippet updates the variable `mx` by setting it to the maximum of its current value and `cur`. Since the initial values of the variables are given in the precondition, we need to consider these values.

Let's assume the initial values of the variables are as follows (since they are not explicitly provided, we will use the general conditions given):
- `s` is a non-empty substring starting from the second character.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `cur` is updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.
- `mx` is the maximum of its current value and either `cur - 1` or `cur - 2` depending on the condition.
- `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur - 2`, and then it is updated to be the minimum of `mn` and `cur`.

However, the code snippet only updates `mx` without changing `cur` or any other variables directly. Therefore, `mx` is set to the maximum of its current value and `cur`.

Since the exact initial values of `mx` and `cur` are not provided, we can express the updated `mx` as follows:
- `mx` is now the maximum of its previous value and `cur`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty substring starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is updated according to the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cur`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur - 2` updated to be the minimum of `mn` and `cur`.**
