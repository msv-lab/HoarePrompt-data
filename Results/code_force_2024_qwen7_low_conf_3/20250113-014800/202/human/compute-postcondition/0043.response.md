According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either 1 or -1, `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, else `mx` is 0, `mn` is -1 if `cur` is -1, else `mn` is 0, and `n` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still be non-empty. This means that the current character `c` from the loop has not yet reached the end of the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either 1 or -1, `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, else `mx` is 0, `mn` is -1 if `cur` is -1, else `mn` is 0, and `n` is an input integer.**
