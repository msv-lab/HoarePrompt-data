According to the given for loop, the loop will iterate over each character `c` in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the variable `s` must be a non-empty string because the loop needs characters to iterate over.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check the String `s`:** The string `s` must be non-empty for the loop to execute since the loop iterates over each character in `s`.
2. **Variables `cur`, `mx`, and `mn`:** These variables (`cur`, `mx`, and `mn`) are not directly related to the condition for the loop to execute. They might be used within the loop body, but their initial values do not affect the loop's ability to run.
3. **Variable `n`:** The value of `n` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution either, as long as `s` is a non-empty string.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `s` must be a non-empty string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is 0, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `n` is an input integer**
