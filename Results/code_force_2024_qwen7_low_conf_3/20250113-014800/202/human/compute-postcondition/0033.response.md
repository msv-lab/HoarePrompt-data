The line `mx = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mx`. This overwrites the previous value of `mx`, which was `mn + 2 * |k|`.

- The value of `mn` is 0.
- The value of `k` is not directly known, but its effect on `mx` is now eliminated since `mx` is set to 0.
- The value of `cur` remains unchanged because it was defined as `mn + k` or `mn - k`, and the assignment to `mx` does not affect `cur`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged because it was only mentioned in the initial state without any operations performed on it.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `s` is the input string from the user.
- `cur` is an integer that is either `mn + k` or `mn - k`, which simplifies to `0 + k` or `0 - k` or `k` or `-k`.
- `mx` is 0.
- `mn` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`s` is the input string from the user, `cur` is either `k` or `-k`, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `n` is an input integer**
