Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is updated according to the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`: if the condition is true, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 1; if false, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 3. `mx` is the maximum of its current value and either `cur - 1` or `cur - 2` depending on the condition; `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur - 2`.***
