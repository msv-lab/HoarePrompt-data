`cur` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial condition was `cur % 2` being equal to the initial value of `c == '1'`, we know that `c` is `'1'` if `cur % 2` is 1, and `c` is not `'1'` if `cur % 2` is 0. After incrementing `cur` by 1, the new value of `cur % 2` will be the opposite of its initial value. Therefore, if `cur` was initially odd (i.e., `cur % 2` was 1), it will now be even (i.e., `cur % 2` will be 0), and vice versa. Since `c` was initially `'1'` when `cur % 2` was 1, and `c` was not `'1'` when `cur % 2` was 0, after the increment, `c` will no longer be `'1'`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer, `c` is a character, `cur` is increased by 1, and `c` is not `'1'`**
