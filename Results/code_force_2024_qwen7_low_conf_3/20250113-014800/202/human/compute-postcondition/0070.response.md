The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`. However, the values of `mx` and `cur` are not specified in the initial state, and only `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is greater than 0, and `cur` is updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`. Since `mx` is not defined before this line of code, it will default to `None` (or `cur` if `cur` is not `None`). After executing the line, `mx` will be set to the maximum of its current value (which could be `None`) and `cur`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is greater than 0, `cur` is updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur`.**
