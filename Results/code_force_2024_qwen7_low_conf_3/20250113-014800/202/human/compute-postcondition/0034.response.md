`cur` is assigned the value `0`, which replaces its previous value of either `k` or `-k`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string from the user, `cur` is 0, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`s` is the input string from the user, `cur` is 0, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `n` is an input integer**
