The code `cur = cur + 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 2.
- `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur - 2`.
- `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur - 2`.

After executing the code, `cur` will be updated to its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 1, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur - 1`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur - 1`**
