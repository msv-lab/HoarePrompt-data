The code `print(mx - mn)` calculates and prints the difference between `mx` and `mn`. 

- `mx` is the maximum of its original value and any value that `cur` has taken during the loop execution.
- `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`.

Since the exact loop and the sequence of values `cur` takes are not specified, the only thing we know for certain is the difference between `mx` and `mn`. Given that `cur` is either `mn + k` or `mn - k` and `k` is an even number, the difference between `mx` and `mn` will be `2 * |k|` because the maximum and minimum values that `cur` can take differ by `2 * k`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be `2 * |k|`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer that is either `mn + k` or `mn - k` where `k` is an even number, `mx` is `mn + 2 * |k|`, `mn` is `mn - 2 * |k|`, and the printed value is `2 * |k|`.**
