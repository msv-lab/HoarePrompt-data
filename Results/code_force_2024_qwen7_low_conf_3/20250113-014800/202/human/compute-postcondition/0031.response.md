The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the input from the user to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is the input string from the user, `cur` is an integer that is either `mn + k` or `mn - k`, `mx` is `mn + 2 * |k|`, `mn` is `mn - 2 * |k|`, `n` is an input integer**
