To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cur` is an integer equal to the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`.
- `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
- `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
- `n` is an input integer.
- The difference between `mx` and `mn` is printed.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs for `t` iterations.
- Since `_` is used as the loop variable (which is common practice when the loop variable is not needed), we don't need to track its value explicitly.
- Each iteration processes some part of the string `s` or updates the values of `cur`, `mx`, and `mn`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`.
   - `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
   - `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, `t` decreases by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `t > 0`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - The values of `s`, `cur`, `mx`, and `mn` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
