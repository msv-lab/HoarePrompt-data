The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cur` is 0, so after executing `cur = cur + 1`, the new value of `cur` is 1. The states of the other variables (`s`, `mx`, `mn`, `n`, and `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is 1, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the current value of `c` satisfies the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`**
