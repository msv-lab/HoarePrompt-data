`cur` is incremented by 1. The initial state is that `s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')` where `c` is the first character of the original string, and `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur`. The value of `cur` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is the value it was before plus 1, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`**
