The code `cur = cur + 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `cur` can only be 1 or -1.

- If `cur` was initially 1, it becomes 2.
- If `cur` was initially -1, it becomes 0.

We also need to update the values of `mx` and `mn` based on these new values of `cur`.

- If `cur` is now 2 (originally 1), then `mx` remains 1 (since it was already the maximum value).
- If `cur` is now 0 (originally -1), then `mn` remains -1 (since it was already the minimum value).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is 2 if originally 1, else 0, `mx` is 1, `mn` is -1, and `n` is an input integer.**
