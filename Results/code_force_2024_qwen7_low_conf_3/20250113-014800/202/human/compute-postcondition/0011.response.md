`cur` is decremented by 1. The value of `s` remains a non-empty string, and the condition `cur % 2 != (c == '1')` is still valid. Since the value of `cur` is updated but its exact new value is not specified in the initial state, we will denote the updated value of `cur` as `cur - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is `cur - 1`, and `cur % 2 != (c == '1')`**
