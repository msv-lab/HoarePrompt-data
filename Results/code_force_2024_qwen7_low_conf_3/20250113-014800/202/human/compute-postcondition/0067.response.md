`cur` is decremented by 1. The condition `((cur % 2 == 0) != (c == '1'))` remains unchanged, and the value of `t` being greater than 0 also remains unchanged. The value of `s` is not an empty string, but no operation affects `s`. Therefore, the updated value of `cur` is `cur - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is not an empty string, `t` is greater than 0, `cur` is `cur - 1`, and ((cur % 2 == 0) != (c == '1'))**
