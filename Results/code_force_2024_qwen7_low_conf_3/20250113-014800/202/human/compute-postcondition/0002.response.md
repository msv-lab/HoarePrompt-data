`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `s` also remains unchanged. The output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length n, and `t` must be greater than 0.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length n, and `t` must be greater than 0**
