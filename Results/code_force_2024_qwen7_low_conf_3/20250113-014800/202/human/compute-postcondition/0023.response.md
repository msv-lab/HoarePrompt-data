`cur` is decremented by 1. Given that `cur` was either `mn + 1` or `mn - 1`, after decrementing, it will become `mn` if it was `mn + 1` (since `mn + 1 - 1 = mn`) or `mn - 2` if it was `mn - 1` (since `mn - 1 - 1 = mn - 2`). 

- If `cur` was `mn + 1`, then `cur` now equals `mn`.
- If `cur` was `mn - 1`, then `cur` now equals `mn - 2`.

The values of `s`, `mn`, and `mx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either `mn` or `mn - 2`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur + 1` if `cur = mn + 1` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`.**
