The code updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`. However, since `mx` is not defined in the initial state, it will be initialized to `cur` if `cur` is greater than whatever value `mx` might have held before (which is undefined in this context). The initial value of `cur` is also not specified, so we will consider it as an arbitrary integer.

Since `mx` is being set to the maximum of itself and `cur`, and without knowing the exact value of `mx` (if it was previously defined), the only concrete change is that `mx` will be at least `cur`.

The Output State is: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value (if defined) and `cur`.**
