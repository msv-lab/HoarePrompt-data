The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value and `cur`. Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cur` is either 1 or -1
- `mx` is initially 0
- `mn` is -1 if `cur` is -1, else `mn` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

Let's consider the two possible values for `cur`:

1. If `cur` is 1:
   - Initially, `mx` is 0.
   - After executing `mx = max(mx, cur)`, `mx` becomes `max(0, 1)`, which is 1.

2. If `cur` is -1:
   - Initially, `mx` is 0.
   - Since `cur` is -1, `mn` would be 0 (from the initial condition).
   - After executing `mx = max(mx, cur)`, `mx` becomes `max(0, -1)`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either 1 or -1, `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, else `mx` is 0, `mn` is -1 if `cur` is -1, else `mn` is 0, and `n` is an input integer.**
