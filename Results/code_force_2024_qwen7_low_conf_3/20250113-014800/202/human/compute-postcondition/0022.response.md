The code `cur = cur + 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `s` is a non-empty string,
- `cur` is either `mn + 1` or `mn - 1`,
- `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`,
- `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1` if `cur = mn + 1` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`.

If `cur = mn + 1`, then `mx` is currently the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1`. After incrementing `cur`, `cur` becomes `mn + 2`. If `cur = mn - 1`, then `mx` is currently the maximum of its original value and `mn - 1`. After incrementing `cur`, `cur` becomes `mn`.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `cur` is now `mn + 2` if it was originally `mn + 1`, or `mn` if it was originally `mn - 1`.
- `mn` remains the minimum of its original value and `cur`, which means if `cur` was originally `mn + 1`, `mn` remains unchanged (since `cur` is now `mn + 2`), and if `cur` was originally `mn - 1`, `mn` also remains unchanged (since `cur` is now `mn`).

The output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either `mn + 2` or `mn`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1` if `cur = mn + 2` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn` if `cur = mn`.**
