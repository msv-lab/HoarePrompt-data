`input()` function reads a line from input and assigns it to `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` also remains unchanged since no operation was performed on them within this snippet. Therefore, the only variable affected is `s`, which now holds the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string**
