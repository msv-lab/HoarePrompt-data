The code assigns the value 0 to `mx`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `mn`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0**
