To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the given code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For each character, it updates the `cur` variable based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.

- If `cur % 2 == 0` is true and `c == '1'` is true, or both are false, `cur` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1.

After each iteration, `cur` is updated, and `mn` and `mx` are updated to track the minimum and maximum values of `cur` seen so far.

### Output State After All Iterations

Let's consider the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

1. **String `s`**: The string `s` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `cur`, `mn`, and `mx`.
2. **Variable `cur`**: `cur` will end up being the final value it attains after processing all characters in `s`. Based on the loop logic, `cur` can be any even number if the sequence of characters leads to an even number of flips (from even to odd or vice versa), and it can be any odd number if the sequence leads to an odd number of flips.
3. **Variable `mn`**: `mn` keeps track of the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop. After all iterations, `mn` will be the smallest value `cur` has taken.
4. **Variable `mx`**: `mx` keeps track of the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop. After all iterations, `mx` will be the largest value `cur` has taken.
5. **Variable `n`**: The variable `n` remains unchanged and retains its original value from the initial state.

### Conclusion

Given the loop's behavior and the constraints, we can summarize the final output state as follows:

**Output State:**
`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer representing the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `n` is the input integer from the initial state.

Thus, the output state is:
```
`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `n` is an input integer.
