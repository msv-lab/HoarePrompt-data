The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates the variable `mn` to be the minimum value between the current value of `mn` and `cur`. Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cur` is either 1 or -1
- `mx` is 0
- `mn` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

The condition for `cur` being updated is `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, which is irrelevant here since `cur` is explicitly set to either 1 or -1 and does not depend on `c`.

If `cur` is 1, `cur % 2 == 0` is False. For `cur` to be 1, `(False) == (c == '1')` must be True, which implies `c != '1'`. However, this condition is not necessary to solve the problem as `cur` is fixed.

If `cur` is -1, `cur % 2 == 0` is also False. For `cur` to be -1, `(False) == (c == '1')` must be True, which again implies `c != '1'`. This condition is not needed to solve the problem.

Given the above, `mn` will be updated to the minimum of its current value (0) and `cur`. Since `cur` is either 1 or -1, the minimum value between `mn` (which is initially 0) and `cur` will be `-1` if `cur` is -1, and `0` if `cur` is 1.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cur` is either 1 or -1
- `mx` is 0
- `mn` is either 0 or -1
- `n` is an input integer

Since we know `cur` can only be 1 or -1, we can specify the exact value of `mn`:
- If `cur` is 1, `mn` remains 0
- If `cur` is -1, `mn` becomes -1

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either 1 or -1, `mx` is 0, `mn` is -1 if `cur` is -1, else `mn` is 0, and `n` is an input integer.**
