The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum between its current value and `cur`. Given the initial conditions:

- `mx` is either 0 or 1
- `cur` is either 2 or -2

If `cur` is 2, `mx` will be updated to 2 because 2 is greater than both 0 and 1. If `cur` is -2, `mx` will remain unchanged since -2 is less than both 0 and 1.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- If `cur` is 2, `mx` becomes 2.
- If `cur` is -2, `mx` remains either 0 or 1.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `mn`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either 2 or -2, `mx` is either 2 or 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, `mn` is either -1 or -2**
