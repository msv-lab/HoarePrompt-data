The code snippet `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates the variable `mn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`mn`) and the value of `cur`. Given the initial conditions:

- `s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character
- `t` is greater than 1
- `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 1
- `mx` is the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`

Since the code does not affect `s`, `t`, or `mx`, their states remain unchanged. The only change occurs in `cur`, which is updated to its previous value minus 1.

However, the value of `mn` is updated to be the minimum of `mn` and the new value of `cur`. Without knowing the exact values of `mn` and `cur`, we can only say that `mn` is now the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 1, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`, and `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.**
