Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cur` is an integer that is either `mn + k` or `mn - k` where `k` is an even number.
- `mx` is `mn + 2 * |k|`.
- `mn` is `mn - 2 * |k|`.
- The printed value is `2 * |k|`.

### Loop Information
The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `t` times. We need to determine the state at the start of each iteration, specifically the values of `s`, `cur`, `mx`, and `mn`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string (remains unchanged within the loop).
   - `cur` is `mn + k` or `mn - k`.
   - `mx` is `mn + 2 * |k|`.
   - `mn` is `mn - 2 * |k|`.
   - The printed value is `2 * |k|`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Each iteration of the loop does not explicitly change the values of `s`, `mx`, or `mn`. The only potential change is to `cur`, but since `cur` is derived from `mn` and `k`, and `mn` and `k` remain constant within the loop, `cur` will always be the same value based on the initial conditions.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - For the loop to continue, it needs to run `t` times. Since the loop condition is simply `range(t)`, the loop will continue as long as there are iterations left.

5. **State at Start of Next Iteration**:
   - `s` remains a non-empty string.
   - `cur` remains the same value (either `mn + k` or `mn - k`).
   - `mx` remains `mn + 2 * |k|`.
   - `mn` remains `mn - 2 * |k|`.

Since these values do not change within the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the start of the current iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer that is either `mn + k` or `mn - k`, `mx` is `mn + 2 * |k|`, `mn` is `mn - 2 * |k|`**.
