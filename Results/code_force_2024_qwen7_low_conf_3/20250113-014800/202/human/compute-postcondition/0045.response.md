The code changes the value of `cur` by subtracting 1 from its current value. Given the initial conditions, `cur` can only be 1 or -1.

- If `cur` was initially 1, after executing `cur = cur - 1`, `cur` will become 0. However, this contradicts the initial condition that `cur` is either 1 or -1, so this case is not applicable.
- If `cur` was initially -1, after executing `cur = cur - 1`, `cur` will become -2.

Based on the initial conditions and the code execution:

- If `cur` was initially 1, it becomes 0, which violates the initial condition, so we consider the only valid scenario.
- If `cur` was initially -1, it becomes -2.
- The value of `mx` is determined by the value of `cur`. Since `cur` is now -2, `mx` will be 0 (as `mx` is 0 when `cur` is -1).
- The value of `mn` is also determined by the value of `cur`. Since `cur` is now -2, `mn` remains -1 (as `mn` is -1 when `cur` is -1).

The output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is -2, `mx` is 0, `mn` is -1, and `n` is an input integer.**
