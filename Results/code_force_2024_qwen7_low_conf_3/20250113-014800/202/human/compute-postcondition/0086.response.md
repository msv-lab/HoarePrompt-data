The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly. However, it seems to operate within a context where multiple test cases are processed, each with its own `t`, `n`, and `s`. Given the constraints, the function likely processes these inputs internally for each test case. The outputs are described in two cases:

Case_1: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `s` is a binary string of length `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). If the function is processing these inputs correctly, it should return a specific value or perform a certain action based on the given conditions.

Case_2: There is no explicit second case provided in the output description, indicating that the function's behavior is fully described by Case_1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `s`, and return a result based on these inputs according to the specified conditions.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \(t\) such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), an integer \(n\) such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and a binary string \(s\) of length \(n\). The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). Based on these inputs, the function returns a specific value or performs a certain action.**
