The code updates the variable `mn` to be the minimum of its current value and `cur`. Given the initial state, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1` depending on the condition `cur % 2 == c == '1'`.

Since `mn` is already defined as the minimum of its original value and `cur`, updating `mn` to be the minimum of `mn` and `cur` does not change the value of `mn`. The value of `mx` remains unchanged as well, because the assignment to `mn` does not affect the calculation of `mx`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either `mn + 1` or `mn - 1`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1` depending on whether `cur % 2 == c == '1'` holds true or not.**
