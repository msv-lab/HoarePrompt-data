Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `cur` is either `mn + 1` or `mn - 1`.
   - `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`.
   - `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1` if `cur = mn + 1` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.

3. **Variables at the Start of the Loop:**
   - At the start of each iteration, `cur` will be updated based on the current character `c` and the previous values of `mn` and `mx`.

4. **Updating `mn` and `mx`:**
   - `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cur`.
   - `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1` if `cur = mn + 1` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`.

5. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, we need to consider the state after processing one more character.
   - Let's denote the next character in the string as `c_next`.

6. **State at the End of the Current Iteration:**
   - `s` remains the same (unchanged).
   - `cur` will be updated based on `c_next`, `mn`, and `mx`.
   - `mn` will be the minimum of its original value and the new `cur`.
   - `mx` will be the maximum of its original value and the new `mn + 1` if `cur = mn + 1` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`.

7. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `s` remains the same (non-empty).
   - `cur` is updated based on the next character `c_next`.
   - `mn` is updated accordingly.
   - `mx` is updated accordingly.

Given that the exact value of `c_next` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values for `cur`, `mn`, and `mx`. However, we know the conditions under which they are updated.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either `mn + 1` or `mn - 1`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1` if `cur = mn + 1` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`, where the next character `c_next` is yet to be processed.**
