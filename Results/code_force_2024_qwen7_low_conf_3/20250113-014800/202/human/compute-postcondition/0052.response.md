Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `cur` is either 3 or -1 or 1 or -3, `mx` is either 2 or 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, `mn` is either -1 or -2. Depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, if the condition is true, `cur` is set to either 3 or -1. Otherwise, `cur` is set to either 1 or -3.***
