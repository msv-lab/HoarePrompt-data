The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates `mx` to the maximum of its current value and `cur`. Given the possible values of `cur` (`mn + 2`, `mn`, `mn - 2`, or `mn - 1`), we need to determine the new value of `mx` based on these conditions.

Let's consider each case:

1. If `cur = mn + 2` or `cur = mn`, `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `mn + 1`.
2. If `cur = mn - 2` or `cur = mn - 1`, `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cur + 1` if `cur = mn - 2` or `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cur - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`.

Since `mx` is updated to the maximum of itself and `cur`, the value of `mx` will be the larger of its original value and the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either `mn + 2`, `mn`, `mn - 2`, or `mn - 1`, `mn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`.**
