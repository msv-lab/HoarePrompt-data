`cur` is decremented by 1. The original value of `cur` is either 2 or -2. After decrementing, if `cur` was 2, it becomes 1; if it was -2, it becomes -3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `cur` is either 1 or -3, `mx` is either 2 or 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, `mn` is either -1 or -2**
