Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop is iterating over each character `c` in the string `s`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, the condition for the next iteration is simply that there are more characters left in the string `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cur` is either 2 or -2.
- `mx` is either 2 or 0 or 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mn` is either -1 or -2.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- The string `s` still has more characters to iterate over.

Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration:
- `cur` remains the same (either 2 or -2).
- `mx` remains the same (either 2 or 0 or 1).
- `n` remains the same (input integer).
- `mn` remains the same (either -1 or -2).

The only thing that changes is that we move to the next character in the string `s`.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `s` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.
- `cur` is either 2 or -2.
- `mx` is either 2 or 0 or 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mn` is either -1 or -2.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `cur` is either 2 or -2, `mx` is either 2 or 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, `mn` is either -1 or -2**
