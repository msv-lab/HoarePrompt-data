`cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` was 0, so the new value of `cur` is -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is -1, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and (`cur % 2 == 0` is not equal to `c == '1'`).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is -1, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and (`cur % 2 == 0` is not equal to `c == '1'`)**
