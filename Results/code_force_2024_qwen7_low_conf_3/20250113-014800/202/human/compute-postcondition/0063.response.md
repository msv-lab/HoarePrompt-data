Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to consider how the loop will initialize and iterate over `s`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `cur` is initially set to 0.
   - `mx` is initially set to 0.
   - `mn` is initially set to 0.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for c in s:` will execute as long as there are characters left to iterate over in the string `s`. 

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, the string `s` must not be empty. If `s` were empty, the loop would not run even once.
   - The initial values of `cur`, `mx`, and `mn` are placeholders for what might be modified inside the loop. We don't need to adjust these explicitly since they will change based on the loop's execution, but we should ensure that the loop can run at all.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and its value doesn't directly affect the loop's ability to run, but it could influence the loop's behavior if used within the loop body.

5. **Final State After Considering the Loop Execution**:
   - The string `s` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `cur`, `mx`, and `mn` are initialized but their specific values won't affect whether the loop runs or not.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and its value is irrelevant for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`s` is not an empty string, `t` must be greater than 0**
