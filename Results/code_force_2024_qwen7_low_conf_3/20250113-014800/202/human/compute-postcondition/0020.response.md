The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates `mx` to be the maximum value between the current `mx` and `cur`. Given the initial conditions:

- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cur` is either `mn + 1` or `mn - 1`
- `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`
- `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1` depending on whether `cur % 2 == c == '1'` holds true or not

Since `cur` is either `mn + 1` or `mn - 1`, `cur` will be either one more or one less than `mn`.

Let's consider both cases for `cur`:

1. If `cur = mn + 1`:
   - Initially, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1`, which means `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `mn`.
   - After executing `mx = max(mx, cur)`, `mx` will be updated to `max(mx, mn + 1)`.

2. If `cur = mn - 1`:
   - Initially, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1`, which means `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `mn - 2`.
   - After executing `mx = max(mx, cur)`, `mx` will be updated to `max(mx, mn - 1)`.

In both cases, `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either `mn + 1` or `mn - 1`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1` if `cur = mn + 1` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`**
