The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates `mn` to be the minimum of its current value and `cur`. Since `cur` is either `mn + 2`, `mn`, `mn - 2`, or `mn - 1`, we need to consider each case:

1. If `cur = mn + 2` or `cur = mn`, `mn` remains unchanged because `min(mn, mn + 2) = mn` and `min(mn, mn) = mn`.
2. If `cur = mn - 2` or `cur = mn - 1`, `mn` is updated to the minimum of `mn` and `cur`, which would be `cur` in these cases.

Therefore, the value of `mn` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `cur`.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `cur`, and `mx`) are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either `mn + 2`, `mn`, `mn - 2`, or `mn - 1`, `mn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cur`, and `mx` is adjusted according to the value of `cur`: if `cur = mn + 2` or `cur = mn`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1`; if `cur = mn - 2` or `cur = mn - 1`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur + 1` if `cur = mn - 2` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`.**
