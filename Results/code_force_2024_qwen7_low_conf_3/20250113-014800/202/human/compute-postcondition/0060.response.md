`mn` is assigned the value `0`. This initializes `mn` to 0, but does not affect the values of `s`, `cur`, `mx`, `mn`, `t`, or `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer.**
