Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `t` is greater than 0, `cur` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the length of the input string `s` is even or odd, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.** 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `cur` is initially set to 0.
   - `mx` is initially set to 0.
   - `mn` is initially set to 0.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Code Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character `c`:
     - If `cur % 2 == 0` is equal to `c == '1'`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.
     - Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1.
     - `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.
     - `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.

3. **Behavior After Multiple Iterations:**
   - If the loop runs at least once, `s` will become an empty string after processing all characters.
   - `cur` will end up being 0 or 1 depending on the parity (even or odd) of the length of the input string `s`:
     - If the length of `s` is even, `cur` will be 0.
     - If the length of `s` is odd, `cur` will be 1.
   - `mx` will be the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
   - `mn` will be the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.

4. **Case When the Loop Does Not Execute:**
   - If `t` is 0 or `s` is an empty string initially, the loop will not execute at all.
   - In this case:
     - `s` remains an empty string.
     - `t` remains 0.
     - `cur` remains 0.
     - `mx` remains 0.
     - `mn` remains 0.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the final values of the variables are as follows:
- `s` becomes an empty string.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `cur` ends up being 0 or 1 depending on the parity of the length of the input string `s`.
- `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
- `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.

Thus, the output state is:
**Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `t` is greater than 0, `cur` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the length of the input string `s` is even or odd, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.**
