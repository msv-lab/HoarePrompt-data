According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop will continue as long as `s` is non-empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is greater than 0, `cur` is updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, and `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still be non-empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that the first character of `s` is consumed in the loop body, making `s` a non-empty substring starting from the second character.

Let's break it down:

1. `s` must remain non-empty.
2. `t` will be decremented by 1 in the loop body.
3. `cur` will be updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.
4. `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`.

Assuming the loop body updates `s` to be the substring starting from the second character, the new state would be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is updated based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')` where `c` is the first character of the original string, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur`.**
