Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character.

2. **Current States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `mn` is 0.
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `cur` is 0.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - The loop will only execute if the string `s` is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one character).

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, the state of the string `s` must be adjusted to ensure it is non-empty. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `mn`, `mx`, `cur`) are not directly relevant to the loop execution condition.

### Final Answer:

State: **`s` must be a non-empty string**
