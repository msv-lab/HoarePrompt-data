Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 1.
   - `mx` is the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.
   - `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in `s`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the variables change within the loop.

4. **Changes During Loop Execution**:
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is a substring of the original string and the loop only iterates over its characters.
   - `t` remains greater than 1 as the loop condition does not modify `t`.
   - `cur` decreases by 1 with each iteration.
   - `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.
   - `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.

5. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `t` remains greater than 1.
   - `cur` is now `cur - 1`.
   - `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cur - 1`.
   - `mn` is the minimum of its previous value and `cur - 1`.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain greater than 1, and `s` must still be a non-empty substring.
   - `cur` will decrease by 1 again.
   - `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is the maximum of the previous value and `cur - 1`) and `cur - 2`.
   - `mn` will be updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cur - 2`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`s` is a non-empty substring of the original string starting from the second character, `t` is greater than 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` minus 2, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur - 2`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur - 2`**.
