Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `mx` is the maximum of its original value (if defined) and `cur`.
   - `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - Inside the loop, `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`.
   - `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cur`.

4. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `mx` or `cur` from the previous iteration, the only concrete changes are that `mx` will be at least `cur` and `mn` will be at most `cur`.

5. **Current Iteration**:
   - In the current iteration, `c` is the next character in the string `s`.
   - The values of `s`, `cur`, `mx`, and `mn` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition must still be true.
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, the loop will continue as long as there are more characters left in the string `s`.

7. **Updated States**:
   - `s` remains a non-empty string (since we are just iterating through the string).
   - `cur` remains an integer.
   - `mx` remains the maximum of its original value (if defined) and `cur`.
   - `mn` remains the minimum of its original value and `cur`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is an integer, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value (if defined) and `cur`.**
