Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(t\) representing the number of binary strings to process, followed by \(t\) pairs of integers \(n\) and a binary string \(s\) of length \(n\). For each binary string, the function calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a running count `cur`. The running count `cur` increments by 1 if the current character in the binary string matches the parity of its index, otherwise it decrements by 1. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, with each binary string having a length between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and ensures that the total length of all strings does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the binary string \(s\) consists entirely of '0's or '1's, the running count `cur` will either always be 0 (for '0's) or will oscillate between positive and negative values (for '1's).
- If the binary string \(s\) alternates between '0' and '1', the running count `cur` will start at 1 and decrease to -1, resulting in a difference of 2.
- If the binary string \(s\) contains only one type of character ('0' or '1'), the difference `mx - mn` will be the absolute value of the length of the string.
- The function correctly handles the case where the string length \(n\) can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), but since there are at most \(10^4\) test cases, the total length constraint is respected.
