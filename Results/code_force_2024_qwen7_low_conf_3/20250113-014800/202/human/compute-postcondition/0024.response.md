Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is either `mn + 2`, `mn`, `mn - 2`, or `mn - 1`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, and `mx` is adjusted according to the value of `cur`: if `cur = mn + 2` or `cur = mn`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `mn + 1`; if `cur = mn - 2` or `cur = mn - 1`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur + 1` if `cur = mn - 2` or `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur - 1` if `cur = mn - 1`.***
