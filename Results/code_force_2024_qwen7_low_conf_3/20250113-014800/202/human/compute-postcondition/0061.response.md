The line `mx = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mx`. The initial value of `mx` was the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, but now it is explicitly set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is 0, `mn` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer.**
