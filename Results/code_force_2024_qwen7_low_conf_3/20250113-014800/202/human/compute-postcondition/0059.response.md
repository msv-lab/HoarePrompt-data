`s` is updated to the value of the input string, which overwrites the original string. The values of `cur`, `mx`, `mn`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `n` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer**
