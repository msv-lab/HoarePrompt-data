`cur` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `cur` is `mn + 1`. The values of `s`, `mn`, and `mx` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is `mn + 1`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value (if defined) and `cur`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is `mn + 1`, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and `cur`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value (if defined) and `cur`.**
