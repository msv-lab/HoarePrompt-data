The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each valid test case, it calls `func_2(s)` to compute a value \( k \), which is then added to the results list. If \( n \) is 0, it appends 0 to the results list without further processing. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the results list. The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into a list of strings, and uses indices to extract \( t \), \( n \), and \( s \) for each test case.
