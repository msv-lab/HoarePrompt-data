The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, the value of `n` remains unchanged. However, the list `a` is now populated with the integers from the input.

Given the initial conditions and the code execution, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `a` is populated with integers from the input.**
