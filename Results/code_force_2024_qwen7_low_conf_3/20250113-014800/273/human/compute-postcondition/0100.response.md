Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is the index of the last student checked (or `n` if no match was found), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `False` since no matching `dist` was found for `a[i]`, and `visit[i]` remains `-1`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**
