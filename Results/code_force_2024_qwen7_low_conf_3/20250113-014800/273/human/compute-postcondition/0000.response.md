`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n` still holds. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.**
