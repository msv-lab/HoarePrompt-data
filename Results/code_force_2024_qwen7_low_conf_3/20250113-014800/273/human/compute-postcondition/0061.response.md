The code assigns the value of `j + 1` to `visit[i]`. Since `j` is 0, `visit[i]` becomes 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[0][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[0][1])`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `True` if `dist == a[i]`, otherwise `found` is `False`; `visit[i]` is 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[0][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[0][1])`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `True` if `dist == a[i]`, otherwise `found` is `False`; `visit[i]` is 1.**
