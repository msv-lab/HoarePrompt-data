The given code snippet does not modify any variables. It prints the positions by joining them with a space using `map(str, visit)` and `print`. The `visit` variable is assumed to be a list of tuples representing the positions, which are derived from the `positions` list. However, since no new values are assigned to any variables and only a print statement is used, the values of `positions` and `visit` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`positions` is a list of positions, each position is a tuple containing two elements, the output is all pairs (pos[0], pos[1]) for each position in `positions`.**
