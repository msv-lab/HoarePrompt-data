Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\), `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\), `i` is 0, `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`, `found` is `False`, `dist` is `abs(0 - j) + abs(1 - 1)` for some `j` where \(0 \leq j < n\)**

Explanation: The code calculates the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`. Given that `positions[i]` is `(i+1, i+1)` and `positions[j]` is `(j+1, j+1)`, the distance `dist` is calculated as `abs((i+1) - (j+1)) + abs((i+1) - (j+1))`, which simplifies to `2 * abs(i - j)`. Since `i` is 0, this becomes `2 * abs(0 - j)`, or simply `2 * abs(j)`. However, since the exact value of `j` is not specified, the most precise representation of `dist` is `abs(0 - j) + abs(1 - 1)`, which is `abs(j)`.
