Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` is the last valid value before the loop broke
   - `dist` is the new Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`
   - `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`
   - `found` is `True`
   - `visit[i]` is `j + 1`
   - `positions` remains unchanged
   - `n` remains unchanged

2. **Understand the loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition:**
   - Since `i` is `n` and the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`, the loop can only continue if `j` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last valid value before the loop broke. For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`.

5. **Update the states accordingly:**
   - `total` remains `0` because the loop body does not affect `total`.
   - `i` remains `n` because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` needs to be updated to `j + 1`.
   - `dist` remains the same unless the loop body changes it.
   - `a_i` remains the same because `i` is not modified within the loop.
   - `found` remains `True` if `dist` equals `a_i`, otherwise it remains `True`.
   - `visit[i]` is set to `j + 1` in the loop body, so for the next iteration, `visit[i]` will be `j + 2`.
   - `positions` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `dist` is the new Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is `j + 2`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `dist` is the new Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is `j + 2`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**
