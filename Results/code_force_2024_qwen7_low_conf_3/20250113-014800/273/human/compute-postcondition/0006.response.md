The code appends a new tuple \((i + 1, i + 1)\) to the `positions` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the new tuple appended will be \((1 + 1, 1 + 1) = (2, 2)\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\)
- `positions` is now \([(1, 1), (2, 2)]\)
- `i` is 2 (since `i` was incremented by 1 in the code)

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\); `positions` is \([(1, 1), (2, 2)]\); `i` is 2**
