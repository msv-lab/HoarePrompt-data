The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes a list `a` of integers where the length of the list `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Based on the given cases, the function does not return any specific value in all scenarios.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `a` of integers and process it without returning any value.
