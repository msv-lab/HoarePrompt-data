The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect any variable values or states. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is the index of the last student checked (or `n` if no match was found), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `False` since the condition `(not found)` is true, and `visit[i]` remains `-1` if no match was found, otherwise `visit[i]` remains `j + 1`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**
