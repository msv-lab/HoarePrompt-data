`positions` is a list of tuples, and its current value is `[(1, 1), (2, 2)]`. The code appends a new tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)` to `positions`, where `i` is currently 3. So, the new tuple to be appended is `(3 + 1, 3 + 1)`, which is `(4, 4)`. After appending this tuple, the `positions` list becomes `[(1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\); `positions` is `[(1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)]`; `i` is 3**
