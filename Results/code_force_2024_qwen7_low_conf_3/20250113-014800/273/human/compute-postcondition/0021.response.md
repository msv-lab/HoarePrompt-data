Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\), `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\), `i` is 0, `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1` except `visit[0]` which is `a[0] + 1`, `found` is `True` if the distance `dist` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `found` remains `False`.***

Explanation:
- The if condition `i != j` is not directly used in the postcondition since the provided postconditions for both if and else parts do not depend on this condition.
- The if part states that if `dist == a[i]`, then `total` remains 0 and `found` is set to `True`. If `dist != a[i]`, no changes are made to the variables.
- Since there is no else part, the postcondition from the if part is the overall postcondition for the entire if-else block.
