Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\), `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\), `i` is \(n\), `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1` except potentially one or more elements updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `found` is `False` since the condition `(not found)` is true.***
