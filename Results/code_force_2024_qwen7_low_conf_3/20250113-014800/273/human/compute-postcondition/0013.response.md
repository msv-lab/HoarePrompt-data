Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial Variables and Conditions**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `i` is 0 (this is already given as part of the loop initialization).
   - `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`.
   - `found` is `False`.

2. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` should be in the range from 0 to \(n-1\). This means the loop will run if `j` is incremented from 0 to \(n-1\).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 0` and goes up to `n-1`, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 0 and increments until `j < n` becomes false.
   - We need to make sure that `n` is within the given bounds (\(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)).

5. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` remains as a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `positions` remains a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `i` is 0 (already provided).
   - `visit` remains a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`.
   - `found` remains `False`.

Based on the above analysis, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\), `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\), `i` is 0, `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`, `found` is `False`.**
