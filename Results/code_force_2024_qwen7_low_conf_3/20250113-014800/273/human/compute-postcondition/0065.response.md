Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `dist` is updated to `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])` if `i != j`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `True` if `dist == a[i]`, otherwise `found` is `False`, and `visit[i]` is 1. All other variables remain unaffected.***
