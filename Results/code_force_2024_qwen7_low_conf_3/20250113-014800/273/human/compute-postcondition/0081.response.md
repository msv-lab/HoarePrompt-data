Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is a value between 0 and `n-1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is now `j + 1`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or switch case.***
