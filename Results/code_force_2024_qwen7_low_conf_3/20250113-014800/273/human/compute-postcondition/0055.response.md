`found` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is 0; `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[1][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[1][1])`; `i` and `j` are different; `j` is 1; `n` is unchanged; `found` is `True`; `visit[i]` is 2.
