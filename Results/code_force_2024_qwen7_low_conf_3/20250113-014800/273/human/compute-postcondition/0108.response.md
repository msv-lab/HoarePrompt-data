The code prints the values of `pos[0]` and `pos[1]`. However, since `print` does not assign the printed values to any variable, the values of `pos[0]` and `pos[1]` themselves do not change. The output of the print statement will be the values of `pos[0]` and `pos[1]`, but these values remain unchanged in the state of the variables.

Output State: **`positions` must have at least two elements remaining, pos[0] is its first element, pos[1] is its second element, the output is pos[0] and pos[1]**
