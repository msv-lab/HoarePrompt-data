`visit[i]` is updated to `j + 1`. The value of `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**
