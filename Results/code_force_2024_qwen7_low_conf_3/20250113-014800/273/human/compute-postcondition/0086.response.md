The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only breaks out of the current loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no loop or switch-case structure in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is the last valid value before the loop broke, `dist` is the new Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**
