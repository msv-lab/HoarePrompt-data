The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)` to the list `positions`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the tuple added is `(0 + 1, 0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `(1, 1)`. This tuple is appended to `positions`, which was initially an empty list. The variables `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated state includes the addition of the tuple `(1, 1)` to `positions`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `positions` is `[ (1, 1) ]`, `i` is 0**
