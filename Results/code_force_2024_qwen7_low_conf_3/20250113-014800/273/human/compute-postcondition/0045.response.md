`dist` is assigned the value of the Manhattan distance between the points `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`. The coordinates of these points are `positions[i][0]` and `positions[i][1]` for the first point, and `positions[j][0]` and `positions[j][1]` for the second point. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and their values are not specified, but they are known to be different. The value of `total` remains 0.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1]); i` and `j` are different.**
