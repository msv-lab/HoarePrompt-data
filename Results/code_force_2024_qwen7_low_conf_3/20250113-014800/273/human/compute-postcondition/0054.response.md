`visit[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `visit[i]` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[1][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[1][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `j` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `False`, `visit[i]` is 2**
