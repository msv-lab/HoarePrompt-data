Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\), `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\), `i` is 3, `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1` except `visit[1]` which is `a[1] + 1`, `found` is `True`, `dist` is 0, `j` is 2, `visit[3]` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.*** 

Explanation:
- If `dist == a[i]` (where `i` is 3), then `found` becomes `True` and `visit[3]` is set to 3. Additionally, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- Since there is no else part, no alternative actions are taken when the condition `dist == a[i]` is not met. Therefore, the other variables remain unchanged, and the postcondition focuses on the changes made within the if condition.
