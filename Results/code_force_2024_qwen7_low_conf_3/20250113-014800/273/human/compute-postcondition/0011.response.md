Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables and their current states:**
   - `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a`: A list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `positions`: A list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `i`: The variable `i` is currently \(n-1\).
   - `visit`: A list of length `n` where every element is `-1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current value of `i`:**
   - `i` is currently set to `n-1`.

4. **Loop condition:**
   - The loop will start executing when `i` is `0` (the first iteration).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be updated to `0` at some point during the loop.

5. **Adjusting the states:**
   - Since `i` is initially `n-1`, the loop will not execute on the first iteration because the condition `i < n` is not met.
   - To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `i` must be set to `0` or any value less than `n` before the loop starts.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state so that the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should be set to `0` or any value less than `n` before the loop starts.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0 (though not used in this context), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\), `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\), `i` is 0, `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`**.
