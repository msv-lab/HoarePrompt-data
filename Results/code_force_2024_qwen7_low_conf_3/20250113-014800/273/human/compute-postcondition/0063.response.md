The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement present in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[0][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[0][1])`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is 1**
