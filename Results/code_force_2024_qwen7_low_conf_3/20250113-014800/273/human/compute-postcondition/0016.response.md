Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\), `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\), `i` is 0, `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`, `found` is `False`, `dist` is `abs(0 - j) + abs(1 - 1)` for some `j` where \(0 \leq j < n\). The condition `dist == a[i]` is true.***
