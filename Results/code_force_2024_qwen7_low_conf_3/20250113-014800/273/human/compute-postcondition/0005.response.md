Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `positions` is \([ (1, 1) ]\).
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` in the range `range(n)`.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since `i` is currently 0, the loop condition `i < n` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` starts at 0 and will be incremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true. Therefore, `n` remains unchanged as long as it satisfies the initial condition \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

5. **List and Positions**: The list `a` and the `positions` list do not change within the loop body based on the given information. Hence, they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `positions` is \([ (1, 1) ]\), `i` is 1**
