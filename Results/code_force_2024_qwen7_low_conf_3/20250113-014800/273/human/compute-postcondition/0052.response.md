Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])`
   - `i` and `j` are different
   - If `dist` is equal to `a[i]`, then `visit[i]` is `j + 1` and `found` is `True`. Otherwise, no changes occur.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the value of `j` changes, starting from the current value of `j`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop starts from the current value of `j` and iterates over `range(n)`, the initial value of `j` remains unchanged until the first iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (assuming `j` was initially set to 0).

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The value of `j` will change to `1` after the first iteration (assuming it started from `0`).
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify it.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - The value of `total` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - The value of `dist` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - The value of `found` remains unchanged unless a match is found, but since we are adjusting for the next iteration, we assume no match was found yet.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `j` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `False`**.

To simplify and align with the required format:

State: **`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `j` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `False`**

Since the specific value of `n` is not given, we keep it as "unchanged" or simply state it as `n` without a specific number.

Final State: **`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `j` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `False`**
