The code snippet does not perform any operations that change the variables. It simply recalculates the value of `dist` using the same formula provided in the initial state. Since `i` and `j` are different and `j` is 1, the value of `dist` remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[1][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[1][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `j` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `False`**
