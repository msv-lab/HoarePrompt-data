Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is the last valid value before the loop broke, `dist` is the new Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `found` remains `True`; otherwise, `found` is still `True`.***
