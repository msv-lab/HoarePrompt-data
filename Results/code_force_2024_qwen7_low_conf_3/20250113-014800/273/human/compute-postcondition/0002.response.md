The code initializes an empty list named `positions`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `positions` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`; `positions` is an empty list**
