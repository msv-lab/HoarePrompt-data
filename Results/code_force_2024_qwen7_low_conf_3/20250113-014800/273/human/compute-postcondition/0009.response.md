Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\); `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\); `i` is \(n-1\)**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from \(i = 0\) to \(i = n-1\).
- For each iteration, the tuple \((i + 1, i + 1)\) is appended to the `positions` list.
- After \(n\) iterations, the `positions` list will contain \(n\) tuples, each of the form \((i + 1, i + 1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\).
- Therefore, `positions` will be a list of length \(n\) with each element being \((i+1, i+1)\).
- The final value of `i` will be \(n - 1\).
