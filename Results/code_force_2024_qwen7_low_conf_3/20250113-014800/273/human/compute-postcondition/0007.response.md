According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `a` and the list of positions `positions` remain as they were at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\); `positions` is \([(1, 1), (2, 2)]\); `i` is 3**
