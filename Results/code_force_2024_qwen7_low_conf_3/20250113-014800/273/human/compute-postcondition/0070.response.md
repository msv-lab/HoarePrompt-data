Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is a value between 0 and `n-1`, `dist` is the absolute difference between the coordinates of `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `visit[i]` is either `-1` or `j + 1` depending on whether `dist == a_i`, `found` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `dist == a_i`, otherwise `found` is `False`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `visit` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, and `found` is `True`.
