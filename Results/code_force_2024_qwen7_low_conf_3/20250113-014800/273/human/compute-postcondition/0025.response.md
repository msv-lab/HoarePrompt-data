The variable `found` is set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\); `positions` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is of the form \((i+1, i+1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\); `i` is 1; `visit` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1` except `visit[1]` which is `a[1] + 1`; `found` is `True`; `dist` is 0.**
