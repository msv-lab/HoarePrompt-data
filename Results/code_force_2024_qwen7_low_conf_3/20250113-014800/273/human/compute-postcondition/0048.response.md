The variable `found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of the other variables (`total`, `dist`, `i`, `j`, `a[i]`, and `visit[i]`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `dist` is equal to `a[i]`, and `visit[i]` is `j + 1`; `found` is `True`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `dist` is equal to `a[i]`, and `visit[i]` is `j + 1`; `found` is `True`**
