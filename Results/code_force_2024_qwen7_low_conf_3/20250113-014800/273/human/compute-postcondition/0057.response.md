Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[1][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[1][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `j` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `found` is `True`, and `visit[i]` is 2. This is the case if `dist == a[i]`. If `dist != a[i]`, the postcondition remains as `total` is 0, `dist` is `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[1][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[1][1])`, `i` and `j` are different, `j` is 1, `n` is unchanged, and `found` is still `False`.***
