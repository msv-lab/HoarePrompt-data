Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `dist` is the new Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is either `j + 1` or `j + 2` depending on whether the condition `dist == a[i]` is met, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, `found` is set to `True` and the loop or statement is broken; otherwise, `visit[i]` is set to `j + 2`.***
