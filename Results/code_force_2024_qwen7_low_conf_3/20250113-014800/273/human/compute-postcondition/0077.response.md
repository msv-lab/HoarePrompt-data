`visit[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. This means that the value of `visit[i]` changes from either `-1` or `j + 1` (depending on the condition) to `j + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is a value between 0 and `n-1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the list `a`, `visit[i]` is now `j + 1`, `found` is `True`, `positions` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**
