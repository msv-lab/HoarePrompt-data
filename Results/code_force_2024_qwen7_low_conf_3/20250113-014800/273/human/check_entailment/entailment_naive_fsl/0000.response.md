Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that each wizard's house must be the only house in its column. In the given solution, the positions of the houses are set to `(i + 1, i + 1)` for all wizards, which violates the condition that no two houses can be in the same column. This setup ensures that the distances `a_i` can be achieved, but it fails to ensure that each wizard's house is the only house in its column.

To meet the requirements, the positions of the houses must be unique in the column dimension. The provided solution does not generate such positions, leading to a violation of the constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
