You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
After some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of
the Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses
will be situated on a picturesque n\times n square field. Each wizard will
have their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house
will take up the space of one square.

However, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the
weekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0
\leq a_{i} \leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are
built horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},
y_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -
y_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit
another wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built
will be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.

Apart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle
in the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other
wizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each
column of the n\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i
-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \neq x_{j} for all i
\neq j .

The Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses
in such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n
wizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.

If it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard
there is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard
is the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each
wizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the
weekends.

If it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.

Input

The first line contains n (2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses
to be built.

The second line contains n integers a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} (0 \leq a_{i} \leq n)

Output

If there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,
output NO.

If the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.

The next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \leq x_{i},
y_{i} \leq n for each wizard.

The i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the
house of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If
there are multiple such wizards, you can output any.

If there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.

Examples

Input

    4
    0 4 2 4
    
Output

    YES
    4 4
    1 3
    2 4
    3 1
    1 1 1 3

Input

    4
    1 3 0 1
    
Output

    YES
    2 1
    4 1
    1 1
    3 1
    3 3 3 1

Note

For the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd
at (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .

The distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .

The distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .

The distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .

The distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard
is |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .

The view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the
placement is correct.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and processes a list `a` of integers where the length of the list `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\). The function attempts to find a permutation of indices for the list `a` such that the Manhattan distance between each pair of consecutive indices in the permutation matches the corresponding value in `a`. If such a permutation can be found, the function prints "YES" followed by the positions of the indices in the permutation and the indices themselves. If no valid permutation can be found, the function prints "NO" and returns. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that each wizard's house must be the only house in its column. In the given solution, the positions of the houses are set to `(i + 1, i + 1)` for all wizards, which violates the condition that no two houses can be in the same column. This setup ensures that the distances `a_i` can be achieved, but it fails to ensure that each wizard's house is the only house in its column.

To meet the requirements, the positions of the houses must be unique in the column dimension. The provided solution does not generate such positions, leading to a violation of the constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
