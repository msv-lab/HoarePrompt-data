The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and processes a list `a` of integers where the length of the list `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\). The function attempts to find a permutation of indices for the list `a` such that the Manhattan distance between each pair of consecutive indices in the permutation matches the corresponding value in `a`. If such a permutation can be found, the function prints "YES" followed by the positions of the indices in the permutation and the indices themselves. If no valid permutation can be found, the function prints "NO" and returns. The function does not return any value.
