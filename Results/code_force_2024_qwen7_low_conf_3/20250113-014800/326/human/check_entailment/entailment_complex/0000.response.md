Reasoning:
- The program iterates over each test case using a loop controlled by `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
- The list of integers is then split into individual string elements.
- The program attempts to find and add the minimum of each pair of integers in the list until the list has fewer than two elements.
- However, the logic for selecting and processing pairs is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes the list will always have at least two elements and removes elements in a manner that doesn't guarantee optimal pairing.

Given the problem's nature, the correct approach is to sort the list of integers and then sum the first `n` elements. This way, you ensure that in each step, the smallest available integers are paired, which maximizes the score.

The current implementation does not correctly implement this strategy and fails to process the list optimally.

Correctness: **False**
