You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50) and a list of \( 2n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( 10^7 \)). For each test case, the function calculates the sum of the minimum values of all valid pairs of integers from the list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the result of each test case. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If the list length is less than 2, the function processes whatever elements are available.
2. The function ensures that the list is processed completely or partially based on the available elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, the variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will hold the score for that specific test case.
3. **Reading Test Case Data**: The program reads the value of `n` and then reads a string of space-separated integers, splitting them into a list `lst`.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - The loop runs `n * 2` times, but this logic is flawed because it assumes the list has at least two elements to remove, even when there are fewer than two elements left. This could lead to an error if the list is exhausted prematurely.
   - The logic for picking the minimum of the first two elements and adding it to the score is correct, but the way it handles the removal of these elements from the list is problematic. It attempts to remove every other element starting from the first index, which may leave non-minimal elements in the list.
   - If the list has fewer than two elements left, the program incorrectly breaks out of the loop without properly processing the remaining elements.
5. **Output**: The program collects the scores for all test cases in `ans_f` and prints them afterward.

The main issue lies in how the program attempts to remove elements from the list. The current logic may leave non-optimal pairs for later comparisons, potentially resulting in a suboptimal score.

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the optimal solution for each test case due to the flawed logic for selecting and removing elements from the list. The optimal strategy involves always pairing the smallest available numbers to maximize the score.
