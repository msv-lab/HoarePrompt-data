Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the list contains more than two elements. According to the problem description, the input list will always contain 2n integers, and the program should process all of them in pairs. However, the current implementation assumes that the list will always have exactly two elements to remove in each iteration, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1
1 2
2
1 1 2 1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The program will produce the following output:
```
1
2
3
```

However, the correct outputs should be:
```
1
2
3
```

But the program fails to correctly process the second test case where the input is `1 1 2 1`. It only adds the minimum of the first two elements and stops, instead of continuing to process the remaining elements. This is because the loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect and should be removed or replaced with proper logic to ensure all elements are processed in pairs.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the list and then iteratively taking the minimum of each pair. Here's an example of how the correct implementation could look:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

This corrected version ensures that all elements are processed in pairs, resulting in the correct scores for all cases.
