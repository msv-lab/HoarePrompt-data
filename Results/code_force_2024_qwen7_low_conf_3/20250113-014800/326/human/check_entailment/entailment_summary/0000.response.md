Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum score by pairing and summing the minimum of each pair from a list of \(2n\) integers. The provided solution aims to do this by iterating through the list and summing the minimum values of pairs until the list is empty.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The solution correctly handles cases where the list might be shorter than expected due to early termination or partial processing.
3. **Algorithm Validity**: The core logic of the solution is to repeatedly find the minimum of the first two elements in the list, add this value to the score, and remove these elements from the list. This approach ensures that the minimum elements are always paired, leading to the optimal score.
4. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution correctly reads multiple test cases, processes each case independently, and outputs the results as required.

Given the above points, the provided program appears to be correct in terms of both logic and handling of edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
