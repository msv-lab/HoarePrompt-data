The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `2` (since `1 * 2` equals `2`) from the list `lst`. The initial state includes that `lst` is a list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed, and its length is not equal to 2.

After removing the element at index `2`, the list `lst` will lose one of its elements. However, since the exact values in `lst` are not specified, we can only say that the list has lost one element at index `2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2 * n`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the modified `lst` plus the current value of `ans`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, the length of `lst` is reduced by one, and `lst` is the list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed.**
