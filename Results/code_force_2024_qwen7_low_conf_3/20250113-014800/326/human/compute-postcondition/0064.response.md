`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input operation. The values of `i`, `ans_f`, `ans`, and `lst` are not updated by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` plus the current value of `ans`, `ans` is 0, and `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed.**
