Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of all valid pairs of integers extracted from the input strings `l`, where each `l` corresponds to an input integer `n` and is processed as described in the loop. `n` is a positive integer for each iteration, and `i` is always `n * 2`. `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed for the last iteration.**
