The code removes the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. Since the list operation `remove` does not return a value but instead modifies the list in place, the value of `lst` changes.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `ans_f` is an empty list
- `lst` has the first word removed
- `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`

After executing `lst.remove(lst[2])`:
- `lst` will no longer contain the element at index 2.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `ans_f` is an empty list
- `lst` has the element at index 2 removed
- `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `lst` has the element at index 2 removed, `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`**
