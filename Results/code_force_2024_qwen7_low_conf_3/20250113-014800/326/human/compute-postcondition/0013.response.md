The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` impacts the following:
- `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value of the integers converted from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.
- `lst` remains unchanged.

Given that `lst` is a list of two words from the input string `l`, let's denote these words as `word1` and `word2`. We need to convert these words to integers and find their minimum value, which will be added to `ans`.

Since the exact words in `lst` are not specified, we'll consider the general case where `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are converted to integers `a` and `b` respectively. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(a, b)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2.**
