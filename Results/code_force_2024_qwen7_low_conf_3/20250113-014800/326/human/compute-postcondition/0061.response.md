The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. This means that the current value of `ans` is added to the list `ans_f`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` plus the current value of `ans`, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of all valid pairs formed, and `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed.**
