`l` is assigned the value of `input()`. This means `l` will hold the string input by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `ans_f`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is 0, `l` is a string input by the user**
