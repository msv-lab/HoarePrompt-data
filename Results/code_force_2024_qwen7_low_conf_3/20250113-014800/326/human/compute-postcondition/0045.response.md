Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` does not contain its first two elements. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.**
