`lst` is a list containing one element `[b]`. The code removes the element at index `2` (which is the second element in the list since indexing starts from 0). However, since `lst` only contains one element, removing the element at index `2` does not affect the list because there is no element at that index.

Therefore, the list `lst` remains unchanged as `[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `lst` is `[b]`, `ans` is `ans + min(a, b)`**
