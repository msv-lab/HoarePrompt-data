The code snippet `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` impacts the variable `ans` by adding the minimum of the first two elements of the list `lst` (converted to integers) to `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.
- The length of `lst` is not equal to 2.

After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to include the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces, the length of `lst` is not equal to 2**
