Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `lst` is modified according to the if condition, and `ans` is updated. Specifically, if the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is set to the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` minus one, and the first element of `lst` is removed. `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the modified `lst` plus the current value of `ans`.***
