`lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is the same as `lst.remove(lst[0])`. Since `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l` and its length is not equal to 2, the first word in the list is removed. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `ans_f`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `lst` has the first word removed, `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`**
