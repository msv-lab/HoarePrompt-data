Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and `lst` is either a list with the element at index 2 removed or a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2 (where we break out of the most internal loop or if statement).***
