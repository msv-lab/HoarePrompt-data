The code removes the second element from the list `lst`. Given the initial conditions, `lst` contains a single element, which means removing the second element (index 1) would leave `lst` empty.

- Initially, `lst` contains one element.
- Removing the second element from a list containing only one element leaves the list empty.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `ans_f`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of its current value and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is an empty list.**
