Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50) and a list of \( 2n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( 10^7 \)). For each test case, the function calculates the sum of the minimum values of all valid pairs of integers from the list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the result of each test case. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If the list length is less than 2, the function processes whatever elements are available.
2. The function ensures that the list is processed completely or partially based on the available elements.**

The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing explicitly, but its primary action is to read input, process the data, and print the results. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program has printed the sum of the minimum values of all valid pairs for each test case.
