Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the list `lst`, `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l`.**

Explanation:
1. The loop runs for `n * 2` times.
2. During each iteration, the loop extracts the first two elements from `lst` and adds the minimum of these two elements to `ans`.
3. After `n * 2` iterations, the loop will have processed `2 * n` pairs of elements.
4. Since the loop breaks if `len(lst)` is not 2, it ensures that only pairs of elements are processed, and any remaining elements in `lst` are ignored.
5. Therefore, `i` will be `n * 2` after the loop completes.
6. `ans` will be the sum of the minimums of all pairs of elements processed during the loop.
7. `ans_f` remains an empty list since there is no indication that it should be modified within the loop.
8. `lst` remains a list of words from the input string `l`, although it may have been modified by the removal of elements during the loop iterations.
