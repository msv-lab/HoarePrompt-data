`ans` is updated by adding `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` to its current value. The current value of `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. After this operation, `ans` will be twice the value of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, the new value of `ans` will be `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` does not contain its first two elements. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.**
