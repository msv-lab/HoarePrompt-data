The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is mentioned in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces, and the length of `lst` is 2.**
