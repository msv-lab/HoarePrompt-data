The code `print(i)` prints the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n * 2` (as per the initial state), the print statement will output `i` which is `n * 2`. The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `n`, and `lst`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list that must contain the value `n * 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n * 2`, and `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed for the last iteration; `i` is printed.**
