The code removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is `0`) from the list `lst`. This means the first element of `lst` is removed.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n * 2`.
- `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`.

After executing `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])`, the list `lst` will have one less element, specifically the first element is removed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, and the first element of `lst` is removed.**
