`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `i` is still 0, `ans_f` is still an empty list, and `ans` is still 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0**
