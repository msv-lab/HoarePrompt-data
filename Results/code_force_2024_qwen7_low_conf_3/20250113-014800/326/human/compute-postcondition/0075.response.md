Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2 * n`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the modified `lst` plus the current value of `ans`, and `ans` is updated according to the following rules: if the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is set to the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`; otherwise, `lst` is updated accordingly and `ans` is updated to the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` minus one, with `lst` having its first element removed.***
