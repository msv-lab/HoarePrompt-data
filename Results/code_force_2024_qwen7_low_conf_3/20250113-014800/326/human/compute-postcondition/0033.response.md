The code `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `ans`, which was the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l`**
