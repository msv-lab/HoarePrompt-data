Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2 * `n`, `lst` is modified according to the following rules: if the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is updated to include the new first element of `lst` and the third element is removed; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `min(lst[0], lst[1]) - 1` and the first element is removed. `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the modified `lst` plus the current value of `ans`.***
