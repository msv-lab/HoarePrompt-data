The code initializes an empty list named `ans_f`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `ans_f` is now defined and empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `n` is not yet defined, and `ans_f` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `n` is not yet defined, and `ans_f` is an empty list**
