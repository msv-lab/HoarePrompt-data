Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `ans_f` is an empty list.
- `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.
- `lst` is either a list with the element at index 2 removed or a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2 (where we break out of the most internal loop or if statement).

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n * 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n * 2`.
2. **Increment**: `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
3. **End Condition**: The loop will stop when `i` reaches `n * 2`.

### Current State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- Therefore, the loop condition `i < n * 2` is satisfied since `0 < n * 2`.

### Next Iteration:
- After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- Hence, `i` will become 1.

### States to Adjust:
- `i` will be 1.
- Since `i` is now 1, the loop condition `i < n * 2` will still be true as long as `n > 0`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is either a list with the element at index 2 removed or a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2 (where we break out of the most internal loop or if statement)**.
