Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans_f` is an empty list.
   - `ans` is the sum of `ans` and either the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` or twice this minimum, depending on the length of `lst`.
   - `lst` is either a list with the element at index 2 removed or a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n * 2`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 (since it started from 0 and incremented by 1).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The loop will continue if `i < n * 2`.

5. **Variables to Adjust**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - The loop condition needs to ensure that `i` is still within the range `[0, n * 2)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
- `ans_f` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `ans` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `lst` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and either the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` or twice this minimum, depending on the length of `lst`. `lst` is either a list with the element at index 2 removed or a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2.**
