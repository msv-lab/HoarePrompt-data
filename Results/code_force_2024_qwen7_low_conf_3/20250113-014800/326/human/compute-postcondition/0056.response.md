The code removes the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. The value of `i` is `n * 2`, so `i` is the index of the element being removed. Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` is a positive integer. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, only its relationship to `n`. After removing the element, the states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `lst` does not contain the element at index 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` excluding the first element, `ans` is the updated sum of minimums based on the given rules and `ans` is decreased by the minimum of the remaining first two elements of `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `lst` does not contain the element at index 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` excluding the first element, `ans` is the updated sum of minimums based on the given rules and `ans` is decreased by the minimum of the remaining first two elements of `lst`.**
