To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues and how the variables change with each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n * 2`
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`
- `ans` is the updated sum of minimums based on the given rules

The loop condition is `i < n * 2`.

Let's analyze the steps:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i = n * 2`
   
2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n * 2`.

3. **Effect of Each Iteration:**
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue until `i` becomes equal to `n * 2`.

4. **At the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n * 2 - 1`

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - To enter the next iteration, `i` must be incremented to `n * 2`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n * 2` (the loop will check `i < n * 2` and it will fail since `n * 2` is exactly `n * 2`).

Since no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `lst` within the loop body, these values remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is the updated sum of minimums based on the given rules**.
