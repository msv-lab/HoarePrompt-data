The code removes the element at index `2 * 1 = 2` from the list `lst`. Given the initial state where `lst` is a list that was modified by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to `ans`, and the removal of the element at index 2, the output state will be:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (unchanged)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (unchanged)
- `ans_f` is an empty list (unchanged)
- `ans` remains the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` (unchanged)
- `lst` has its second element removed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` has its second element removed**
