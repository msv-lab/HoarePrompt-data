State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `n` is not yet defined, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `t` must be greater than 0**.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Variable `t`:** The variable `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 5000. For the loop `for i in range(t):` to execute, `t` must be a positive number (greater than 0) because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
2. **Variable `i`:** In the initial state before the loop, `i` should be set to 0 since the loop starts with `i=0` and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. **Variable `n`:** The variable `n` is not yet defined, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. **Variable `ans_f`:** The list `ans_f` is already stated to be empty, which is fine for the loop to start.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are ensuring `t` is greater than 0 and setting `i` to 0.
