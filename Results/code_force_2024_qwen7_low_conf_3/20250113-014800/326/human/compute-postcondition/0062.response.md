Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n * 2`.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` plus the current value of `ans`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the minimums of all valid pairs formed.
   - `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed.

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` would be `n * 2 - 1` (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `n * 2`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is reset to `n * 2` at the start of each iteration, we only need to ensure that `i` is within the required range for the next iteration.
   - The state of `ans`, `ans_f`, and `lst` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no modifications are specified in the loop body, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be set to `n * 2`.
- `n` and `t` remain the same as they did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `ans`, `ans_f`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` plus the current value of `ans`, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of all valid pairs formed, and `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed.**
