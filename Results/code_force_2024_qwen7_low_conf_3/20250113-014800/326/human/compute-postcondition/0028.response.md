The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no loop or if statement is specified in the initial code snippet, the only effect is breaking out of an implied loop or if statement.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
