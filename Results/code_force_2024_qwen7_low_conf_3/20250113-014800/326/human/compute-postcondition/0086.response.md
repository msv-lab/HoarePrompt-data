The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the third element from the list `lst`. Since the first element of `lst` was already removed before this line of code, the third element is now at index 2. 

Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer and `i` is set to `2 * n`, the value of `i` will remain unchanged because the code does not affect `n` or `i`. The `lst` list has its third element removed, and `ans` is updated to include the new first element of `lst`, but since only the removal is mentioned, we'll focus on the updated elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is 2 * `n`; lst is unchanged except the third element is removed; `ans` is updated to include the new first element of `lst`; `ans_f` is unchanged.**
