Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of its current value and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. If `len(lst)` is not 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
