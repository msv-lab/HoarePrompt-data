The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to `ans`. The initial state provides that `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, which implies `ans` already includes this value. Thus, the operation `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` will simply add the same value again, meaning `ans` remains unchanged.

The variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `ans_f`, and `lst` are not directly affected by the given code snippet. The value of `i` is not mentioned to be changed in the provided code, and `ans_f` remains an empty list since no operation was performed on it. The value of `lst` might change if there was a previous operation that modified it, but based solely on the provided code, `lst` remains as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` remains the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is either a list with the element at index 2 removed or a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2 (where we break out of the most internal loop or if statement)**
