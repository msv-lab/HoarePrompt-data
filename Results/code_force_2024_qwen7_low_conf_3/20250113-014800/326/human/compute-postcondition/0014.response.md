The `break` statement does not modify any variable's value; it only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the only thing that happens is that the program exits the implicit loop or if statement it was in. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
