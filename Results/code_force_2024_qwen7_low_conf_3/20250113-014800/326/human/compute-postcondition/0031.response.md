The code `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. The value of `ans` is the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the list `lst`. The variable `ans` is not modified by this line of code; it simply gets added to `ans_f`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` (which is equal to `ans`), `ans` is the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l`.**
