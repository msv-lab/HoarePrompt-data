Let's break down the given state and determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is `n * 2`.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` plus the current value of `ans`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed.
- `l` is the input value from the user.
- `lst` is the list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop runs for `i` values from 0 to `n * 2 - 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < n * 2`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - Since `i` is set to `n * 2`, `n` should be a positive integer (at least 1) for the loop to run.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is 0, and `lst` is already defined based on `l`.
   - The state of `ans_f` and `lst` does not affect the loop condition directly but might affect the loop body.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, the key state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being a positive integer (at least 1).

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` must be a positive integer (at least 1), `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` plus the current value of `ans`, `ans` is 0, and `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed; `l` is the input value from the user, `lst` is the list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.**
