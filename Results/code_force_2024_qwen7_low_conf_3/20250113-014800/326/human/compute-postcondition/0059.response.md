Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`. If `lst` does not contain the element at index 2, `ans` is decreased by the minimum of the remaining first two elements of `lst`. Otherwise, `ans` includes the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or structure.**
