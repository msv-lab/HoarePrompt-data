The code snippet `print(i)` prints the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `n * 2` in the initial state, and `n` is a positive integer for each iteration, `i` remains as `n * 2`. The value of `i` is printed, but it does not change the value of `i` itself. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list, `n` is a positive integer for each iteration, `i` is `n * 2`, `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed for the last iteration. The value of `i` is printed.**
