The code removes the element at index `lst[2]` (since `1 * 2` equals `2`) from the list `lst`. The previous state had `i` defined as `n * 2 + 1`, which means `i` was updated based on the value of `n`, but this value itself is not affected by the removal operation.

Let's break it down:

1. `lst.remove(lst[2])`: This removes the third element (index 2) from the list `lst`.

2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n * 2 + 1`
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`
- `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`
- The list `lst` does not contain its first element, and the second element has been removed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, the list `lst` does not contain its first two elements.**
