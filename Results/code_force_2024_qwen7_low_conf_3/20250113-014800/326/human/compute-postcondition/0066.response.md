The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` into a list of substrings based on spaces. The original values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `ans_f`, `ans`, and `lst` remain unchanged, but now `lst` is updated to be the split result of `l`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` plus the current value of `ans`, `ans` is 0, and `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed; `l` is the input value from the user, `lst` is the list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.**
