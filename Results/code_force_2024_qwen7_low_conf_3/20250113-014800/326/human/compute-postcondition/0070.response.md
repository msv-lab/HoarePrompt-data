`lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is `0`) from the list `lst`. Given that `i` is `n * 2`, the value of `i` is `2 * n`. The removal of the first element in `lst` will affect the list but not the other variables. The length of `lst` is not equal to 2, and `l` is the input value from the user.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2 * n`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst` plus the current value of `ans`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is the list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `l` is the input value from the user.**
