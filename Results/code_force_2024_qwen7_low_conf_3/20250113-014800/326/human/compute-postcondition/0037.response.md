Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `n` is the new input integer (greater than 0).
   - `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The `for` loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n * 2`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n * 2` is greater than 0, which implies that `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `n > 0` because if `n` is not greater than 0, the loop will not execute at all.
   - The value of `i` should match the initialization given in the loop (`i = n * 2 + 1`).

4. **Output State:**
   - The initial state of `ans_f`, `ans`, and `lst` is already defined in the output state, so no changes are needed for these variables.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be initialized as `n * 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop execution is:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.**
