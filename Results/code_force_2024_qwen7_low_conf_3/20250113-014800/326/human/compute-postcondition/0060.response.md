To determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop runs `n * 2` times, and within each iteration:
- If the length of `lst` is not 2, it removes the first and third elements of `lst` and updates `ans` to `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
- If the length of `lst` is 2, it updates `ans` to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

### Initial State
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n * 2`.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.

### Loop Execution
Let's consider the behavior of the loop when `lst` has different lengths:
1. **When `len(lst)` is not 2**:
   - The first and third elements are removed.
   - `ans` is updated to `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
2. **When `len(lst)` is 2**:
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

Given the loop runs `n * 2` times, we need to consider how many valid pairs can be formed from `lst`.

### Final State Analysis
- **Case 1: Length of `lst` is less than 2**:
  - If `len(lst) < 2` after all iterations, no valid pairs can be formed, so `ans` will remain 0.
  - `lst` will be empty since all elements will be removed.

- **Case 2: Length of `lst` is 2 or more**:
  - The loop will keep removing elements until `lst` cannot form valid pairs anymore.
  - `ans` will be the sum of the minimums of all valid pairs formed.

### Conclusion
After the loop finishes executing all `n * 2` iterations, the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` will be `n * 2` unless `lst` is exhausted, in which case it will be adjusted.
- `ans_f` remains a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`.
- `ans` will be the sum of the minimums of all valid pairs formed.
- `lst` will be empty if all elements are removed, otherwise, it will contain the remaining elements.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of all valid pairs formed, and `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed.**
