The code splits the string `l` into a list of substrings using space as the delimiter. This means that `lst` will contain all the words from the string `l` as separate elements in a list.

- `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `i` remains 0.
- `ans_f` remains an empty list.
- `ans` remains 0.
- `l` is split into a list `lst` where each element is a word from the original string `l`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l`.**
