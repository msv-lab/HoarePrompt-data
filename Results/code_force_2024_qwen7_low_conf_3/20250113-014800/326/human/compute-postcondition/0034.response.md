The code assigns the value of the input to `n`, which overwrites the previous value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state was that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, and `ans` is 0. After executing the code, `n` is updated to the new input value, while `t`, `i`, `ans_f`, and `ans` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is 0**
