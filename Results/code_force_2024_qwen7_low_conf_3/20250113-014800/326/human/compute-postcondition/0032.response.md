According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `i` is `n * 2`
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`
- `ans` is the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`
- `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Given that `i` is initially `n * 2`, and `n` is greater than 0, we need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration.

Since `i` is increased by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `n * 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same
- `n` remains the same
- `i` becomes `n * 2 + 1`
- `ans_f` remains the same
- `ans` remains the same
- `lst` remains the same

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `lst` is a list of words from the input string `l`**
