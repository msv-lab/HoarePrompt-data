Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, and `ans` is the updated sum of minimums based on the following rules:
- If `len(lst) != 2`, the first and third elements of `lst` are removed, and `ans` is set to `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
- If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. Additionally, if the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` does not contain its first two elements. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.**
