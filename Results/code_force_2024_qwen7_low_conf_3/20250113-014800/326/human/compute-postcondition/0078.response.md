`lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is `0`, from the list `lst`. Since `lst` is initially `[a, b]`, removing the element at index `0` (which is `a`) results in `lst` becoming `[b]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `lst` is `[b]`, and `ans` is `ans + min(a, b)`**
