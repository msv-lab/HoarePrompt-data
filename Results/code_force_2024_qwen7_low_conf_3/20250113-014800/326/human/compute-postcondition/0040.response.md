The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is index 0) from the list `lst`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n * 2 + 1`
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`
- `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2

After the code executes:
- The first element of `lst` (index 0) is removed.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` does not contain its first element**
