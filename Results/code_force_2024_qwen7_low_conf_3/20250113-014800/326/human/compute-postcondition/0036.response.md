The code splits the string `l` into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. This affects the variable `lst`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `ans_f`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

The output state is: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.**
