Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over the list `ans_f`. For the loop to execute, `ans_f` must contain at least one element.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of all valid pairs of integers extracted from the input strings `l`.
   - `n` is a positive integer for each iteration.
   - `i` is always `n * 2`.
   - `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed for the last iteration.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `ans_f` is not empty.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `ans_f` is non-empty for the loop to execute. Since `ans_f` is derived from processing the input strings `l` and `t`, we need to ensure that the process of forming `ans_f` has completed and resulted in at least one element.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `ans_f` is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list, `n` is a positive integer for each iteration, `i` is always `n * 2`, `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed for the last iteration.**
