Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`.
   - `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
   - If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` does not contain its first two elements. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `n * 2`.

3. **Current State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `i` needs to be `n * 2 + 2`.
   - The condition `i in range(n * 2)` needs to be true, which means `i` should be less than `n * 2`.

Given the current state where `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, the loop cannot execute because `n * 2 + 1` is not within the range `range(n * 2)`. However, if we want to adjust the state to allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `n * 2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is `n * 2`.

**Adjusted State**:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n * 2`.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`.
- `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
- If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` does not contain its first two elements. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.

**State**: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` does not contain its first two elements. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.**
