The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables but indicates the end of the current loop or the deepest nested if-else statement. Since no loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and twice the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is either a list with the element at index 2 removed or a list of words from the input string `l` with length 2**
