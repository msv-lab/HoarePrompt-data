The code `print(i)` simply prints the value of `i`, which is already defined as `n * 2`. The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `n`, `lst`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list that contains the value `n * 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n * 2`, `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed for the current iteration, the value of `i` is printed.**
