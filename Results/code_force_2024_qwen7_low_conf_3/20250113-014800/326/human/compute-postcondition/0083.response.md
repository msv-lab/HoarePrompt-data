Let's break down the problem step by step to understand the changes needed for the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
- `lst` is modified according to the if condition.
- `ans` is updated based on the condition of `lst`.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the modified `lst` plus the current value of `ans`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `range(n * 2)`, meaning it runs `2 * n` times.

### Current State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2 * n - 1`.

### Next Iteration:
For the next iteration of the loop, `i` will increment by 1, making `i` equal to `2 * n`.

### Adjusted States:
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n * 2`. Since `i` was `2 * n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `2 * n` for the next iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's summarize the states needed for the next iteration:

- `t` remains between 1 and 5000.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` is now `2 * n`.
- `lst` is still modified according to the if condition.
- `ans` is still updated based on the condition of `lst`.
- `ans_f` is still a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the modified `lst` plus the current value of `ans`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2 * n, `lst` is modified according to the if condition, and `ans` is updated. Specifically, if the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is set to the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` minus one, and the first element of `lst` is removed. `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from the modified `lst` plus the current value of `ans`.**
