The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `2` (since `1 * 2` equals `2`) from the list `lst`. This operation directly modifies the list `lst` by removing its third element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n * 2`.
- `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, and the first element of `lst` is removed.

After executing the code, the value of `lst` will have its third element removed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, and the first element of `lst` is removed; the third element of `lst` is removed.**
