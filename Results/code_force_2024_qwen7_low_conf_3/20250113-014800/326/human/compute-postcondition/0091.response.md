The code `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. This does not change the value of `ans`, but adds it to `ans_f`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `lst` is either empty or contains the remaining elements after all valid pairs are formed, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of pairs of integers extracted from `lst`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`.**
