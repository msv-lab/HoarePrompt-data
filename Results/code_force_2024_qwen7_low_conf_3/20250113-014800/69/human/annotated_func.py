    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ### Analysis and Determination of the Output State
    #
    #Given the initial state and the loop code, let's break down the loop's behavior and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.
    #
    ##### Initial State:
    #- `m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months.
    #- `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary.
    #- `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.
    #- `earnings` is 0.
    #- `happiness` is an empty list.
    #
    ##### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for i in range(1, m + 1):
    #    earnings += x
    #    while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
    #        earnings -= costs[-1]
    #        happiness.append(1)
    #        costs.pop()
    #```
    #
    ##### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
    #   - In each iteration, `earnings` is increased by `x`.
    #   - A `while` loop checks if the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.
    #     - If true, `earnings` is reduced by the last element of `costs`.
    #     - `happiness` appends a `1`.
    #     - The last element of `costs` is popped.
    #   - This process continues until the `while` loop condition is false.
    #
    #2. **Final State**:
    #   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `m`.
    #   - `earnings` will be the final value after adding `x` for each month and subtracting elements from `costs` as long as they are less than or equal to `earnings`.
    #   - `costs` will be an empty list because all elements will have been popped.
    #   - `happiness` will be a list containing `m` ones, as the `while` loop runs `m` times.
    #
    #3. **Edge Case: No Elements in `costs`**:
    #   - If `costs` is initially empty, the `while` loop will never run, and `earnings` will simply increase by `x*m`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #
    #- `i` is `m`.
    #- `earnings` is the sum of `x` added for each month minus the sum of all elements in `costs` that were less than or equal to `earnings`.
    #- `costs` is an empty list.
    #- `m` remains the same.
    #- `x` remains the same.
    #- `happiness` is a list containing `m` ones.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #```
    #Output State: i` is `m`, `earnings` is the final value after adding `x` for each month and subtracting elements from `costs` that are less than or equal to `earnings`, `costs` is an empty list, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is a list containing `m` ones.
    #```
    return len(happiness)
    #The program returns `m`, which is the number of months, and `happiness` is a list containing `m` ones.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m` (the total number of months), `x` (the monthly salary), and `costs` (a list of positive integers representing the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in each month). The function first sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates over each month, incrementing the `earnings` by the monthly salary `x`. During each iteration, it checks if the last element of the `costs` list is less than or equal to the current `earnings`. If true, it reduces `earnings` by the cost, appends a `1` to the `happiness` list, and removes the cost from the `costs` list. After processing all months, the function returns the length of the `happiness` list, which is always equal to `m`, and the `happiness` list itself, which contains `m` ones.
