The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m` (the total number of months), `x` (the monthly salary), and `costs` (a list of positive integers representing the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in each month). The function first sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates over each month, incrementing the `earnings` by the monthly salary `x`. During each iteration, it checks if the last element of the `costs` list is less than or equal to the current `earnings`. If true, it reduces `earnings` by the cost, appends a `1` to the `happiness` list, and removes the cost from the `costs` list. After processing all months, the function returns the length of the `happiness` list, which is always equal to `m`, and the `happiness` list itself, which contains `m` ones.
