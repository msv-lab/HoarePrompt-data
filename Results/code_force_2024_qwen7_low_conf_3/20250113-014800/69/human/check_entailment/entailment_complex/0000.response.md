### Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months.
   - `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary.
   - `costs` is a list of positive integers where `costs[i]` represents the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in the `i`-th month.
   - `earnings` is initialized to 0.
   - `happiness` is an empty list.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function sorts the `costs` list in descending order.
   - For each month (`i` from 1 to `m`):
     - Increment `earnings` by `x`.
     - While the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, pop the last element of `costs`, reduce `earnings` by the popped element, and append 1 to `happiness`.

3. **Post-Loop State**:
   - After processing all months, `earnings` will be the total salary earned minus the sum of all costs that could be purchased.
   - `costs` will be empty since all elements will have been processed.
   - `happiness` will contain `m` ones because the loop runs `m` times and appends 1 each time.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the length of the `happiness` list, which is `m`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly ensures that Charlie buys the happiness units using his monthly earnings.
   - The sorting of `costs` in descending order allows buying the cheapest possible happiness units first, maximizing the total units bought within the constraints.
   - The loop ensures that only affordable happiness units are bought each month, respecting the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly calculates and returns the maximum number of happiness units Charlie can purchase given the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
