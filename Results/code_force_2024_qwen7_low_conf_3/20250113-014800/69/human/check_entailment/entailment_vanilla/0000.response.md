Reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the maximum units of happiness Charlie can achieve within `m` months, given his monthly salary `x` and the costs `c_i` for each month to buy one unit of happiness.
2. The provided solution sorts the costs in descending order, which helps in making optimal decisions by trying to buy happiness as early as possible when the cost is lower.
3. The logic inside `func_1`:
   - Sorts the costs in reverse order to start from the highest cost.
   - Iterates through each month, adding the monthly salary to the `earnings`.
   - While there are still costs available and the current earnings are sufficient to buy happiness (i.e., `costs[-1] <= earnings`), it subtracts the cost from the earnings and increments the happiness count.
   - This ensures that Charlie spends his earnings strategically to maximize the units of happiness he can accumulate.
4. The solution correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
