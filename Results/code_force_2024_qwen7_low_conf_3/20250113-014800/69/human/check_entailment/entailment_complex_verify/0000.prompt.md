You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You can never buy enough happiness, so here we go again! In this version, you
can only buy h_i = 1 unit of happiness each month, but the number of months is
hugely increased. We are in the realm of quantum happiness and time dilation.

Being a physicist, Charlie likes to plan his life in simple and precise terms.

For the next m months, starting with no money, Charlie will work hard and earn
x pounds per month. For the i -th month (1 \le i \le m) , there'll be a single
opportunity of paying cost c_i pounds to obtain one unit of happiness. You
cannot buy more than one unit each month.

Borrowing is not allowed. Money earned in the i -th month can only be spent in
a later j -th month (j>i ).

Since physicists don't code, help Charlie find the maximum reachable units of
happiness.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers, m and x (1 \le m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x \le 10^3 ) — the total number of months and the monthly
salary.

The second line of each test case contains m integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m (1
\leq c_i \leq 10^3 ) — the cost of one unit of happiness for each month.

It is guaranteed that sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the maximal amount of happiness
Charlie can get.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ### Analysis and Determination of the Output State
    #
    #Given the initial state and the loop code, let's break down the loop's behavior and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.
    #
    ##### Initial State:
    #- `m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months.
    #- `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary.
    #- `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.
    #- `earnings` is 0.
    #- `happiness` is an empty list.
    #
    ##### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for i in range(1, m + 1):
    #    earnings += x
    #    while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
    #        earnings -= costs[-1]
    #        happiness.append(1)
    #        costs.pop()
    #```
    #
    ##### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
    #   - In each iteration, `earnings` is increased by `x`.
    #   - A `while` loop checks if the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.
    #     - If true, `earnings` is reduced by the last element of `costs`.
    #     - `happiness` appends a `1`.
    #     - The last element of `costs` is popped.
    #   - This process continues until the `while` loop condition is false.
    #
    #2. **Final State**:
    #   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `m`.
    #   - `earnings` will be the final value after adding `x` for each month and subtracting elements from `costs` as long as they are less than or equal to `earnings`.
    #   - `costs` will be an empty list because all elements will have been popped.
    #   - `happiness` will be a list containing `m` ones, as the `while` loop runs `m` times.
    #
    #3. **Edge Case: No Elements in `costs`**:
    #   - If `costs` is initially empty, the `while` loop will never run, and `earnings` will simply increase by `x*m`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #
    #- `i` is `m`.
    #- `earnings` is the sum of `x` added for each month minus the sum of all elements in `costs` that were less than or equal to `earnings`.
    #- `costs` is an empty list.
    #- `m` remains the same.
    #- `x` remains the same.
    #- `happiness` is a list containing `m` ones.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #```
    #Output State: i` is `m`, `earnings` is the final value after adding `x` for each month and subtracting elements from `costs` that are less than or equal to `earnings`, `costs` is an empty list, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is a list containing `m` ones.
    #```
    return len(happiness)
    #The program returns `m`, which is the number of months, and `happiness` is a list containing `m` ones.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m` (the total number of months), `x` (the monthly salary), and `costs` (a list of positive integers representing the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in each month). The function first sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates over each month, incrementing the `earnings` by the monthly salary `x`. During each iteration, it checks if the last element of the `costs` list is less than or equal to the current `earnings`. If true, it reduces `earnings` by the cost, appends a `1` to the `happiness` list, and removes the cost from the `costs` list. After processing all months, the function returns the length of the `happiness` list, which is always equal to `m`, and the `happiness` list itself, which contains `m` ones.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where the cost of happiness exceeds the total earnings accumulated so far. Specifically, the program assumes that there will always be an opportunity to buy happiness within the remaining months, which is not necessarily true. 

Consider the following input:
```
2
3 3
10 10 10
```
In this case, the cost of happiness in each month is 10 pounds, which is greater than the monthly salary of 3 pounds. Therefore, Charlie cannot afford to buy any happiness, and the maximum happiness he can achieve is 0. However, the program incorrectly prints 2 because it only checks if the current month's cost is less than or equal to the accumulated earnings without considering the possibility of not being able to buy happiness in subsequent months due to insufficient funds.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that Charlie has enough money to buy happiness in future months. This can be achieved by maintaining a running balance of available funds and checking if the cost is within the budget before attempting to purchase happiness.
