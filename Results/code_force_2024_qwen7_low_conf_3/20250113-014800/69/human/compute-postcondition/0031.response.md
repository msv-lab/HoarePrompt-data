`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since `costs` initially has at least one element, this operation reduces the length of `costs` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `earnings`, `m`, `x`, `happiness`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `earnings` is `earnings - 2 * costs[-1]`, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1, 1, 1]`, `costs` length is reduced by 1.**
