Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is either equal to `s + m - l[i]` if `s >= l[i]` or equal to `s + m` if `s < l[i]`, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + 1 + (k + 1)` if `s >= l[i]` or `cnt_initial + (k + 1)` if `s < l[i]`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`**.
