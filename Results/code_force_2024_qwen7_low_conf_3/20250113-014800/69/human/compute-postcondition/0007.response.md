The code appends the value `1` to the `happiness` list. The previous value of `happiness` was an empty list, so after appending `1`, `happiness` becomes `[1]`. The other variables (`m`, `x`, `costs`, `earnings`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is `x - costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1]`, `i` is 1.**
