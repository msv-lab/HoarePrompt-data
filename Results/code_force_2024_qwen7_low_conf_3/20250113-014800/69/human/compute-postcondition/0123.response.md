`s` is decremented by `l[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `s` is decremented by `l[2]`. The value of `l[2]` is part of the initial state, but since it is not specified, we will keep it as `l[2]`.

All other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `h`, `cnt`, and `mx`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n > 0`, `i` is 2, `s` is `s - l[2]`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1**
