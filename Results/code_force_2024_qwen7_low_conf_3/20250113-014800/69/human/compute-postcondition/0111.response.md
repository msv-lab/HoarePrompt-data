The code `mx = max(mx, cnt)` updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `mx`. We only know that `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, which means `cnt` is now 1 (since it was initially set to 0 in the given context).

Therefore, `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value (unknown) and 1. Since `mx` is not specified initially, it could be less than, equal to, or greater than 1. But after this operation, `mx` will be at least 1.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 0; `h` contains `-l[2]`; `cnt` is 1; `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1.**
