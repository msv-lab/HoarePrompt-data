The `pop()` method removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since `costs` originally had a length that was one more than the number of elements in `happiness` (which had 3 elements), the `costs` list now has a length one less than before. The value of `i` is not affected, `earnings` is not directly modified by this operation, `m` remains the same, and `x` remains the same. The `happiness` list is updated to `[happiness[0], 1, 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`; `costs` length is one less than before; `m` remains the same; `x` remains the same; `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1, 1]`.**
