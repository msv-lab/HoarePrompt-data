The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` updates the `earnings` by subtracting the last element of `costs` from it. Given the initial conditions:

- `i` is 2.
- `earnings` is reduced by `costs[-1]` from the previous iteration.
- `costs` length is one less than before.
- `m` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1]`.
- `earnings` must be greater than or equal to 4.

Since `costs` has lost one element in each iteration and must still have elements, and `earnings` must be greater than or equal to 4, the updated state will be:

- `earnings` is now `earnings - costs[-1]`.
- `costs` length is one less than before, meaning it still has at least one element.
- `m` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`; `costs` length is one less than before; `m` remains the same; `x` remains the same; `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1]`.**
