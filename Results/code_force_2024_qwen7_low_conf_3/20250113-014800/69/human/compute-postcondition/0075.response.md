The code `heapq.heappush(h, -l[i])` pushes the value `-l[i]` onto the heap `h`. This operation does not change the value of `s`, `n`, `h`, `cnt`, or `mx`. However, it does affect the contents of the heap `h`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is equal to `s + m - l[i]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the smallest of `-l[i]` and the previous elements
- The current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`
- `cnt` is `cnt_initial + (k + 1)`
- `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`

After pushing `-l[i]` onto the heap `h`, the smallest element in `h` will be updated to be the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is equal to `s + m - l[i]`, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`, the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + (k + 1)`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`**
