Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is less than `l[i]` and equal to `s + m`, `h` is a heap with `-l[i]` as one of its elements, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + (k + 1)`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the if condition evaluation.***
