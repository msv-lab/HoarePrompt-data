The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since the initial value of `cnt` is either 1 or 2, incrementing it by 1 will result in `cnt` being either 2 or 3.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `h`, `mx`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 3
- `s` is its original value minus `l[3]`
- `h` contains `-l[2]` and `-l[3]`
- `cnt` is now either 2 or 3 (depending on its initial value)
- `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `s` is its original value minus `l[3]`; `h` contains `-l[2]` and `-l[3]`; `cnt` is either 2 or 3; `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1**
