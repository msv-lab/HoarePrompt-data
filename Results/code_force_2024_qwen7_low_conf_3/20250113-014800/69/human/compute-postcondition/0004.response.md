`earnings` is incremented by the value of `x`. The initial value of `x` is a positive integer, so the new value of `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` (which is 0) plus `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is `x`, `happiness` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 0.**
