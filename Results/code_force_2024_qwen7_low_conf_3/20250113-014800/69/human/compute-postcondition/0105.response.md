The code initializes an empty list `h`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state will keep the values of the other variables as they are in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `s` is 0, `h` is an empty list, `cnt` is 0, `mx` is 0, `rs` is a list containing the value of `cnt`, and `k` is decremented by 1; `l` is updated with the new list of integers from the input.**
