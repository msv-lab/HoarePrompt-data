The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it implies that the function might internally use or accept parameters through other means (such as global variables or input from outside). Given the constraints:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `m` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\).
- The list `c` contains `m` integers where \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq m\).

Since the function definition itself does not include these parameters, the return value directly follows the provided cases.

Output Cases:
- Case_1: The function returns an integer `t`.
- Case_2: For each of the `t` test cases, the function returns a result based on `m`, `x`, and `c`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept and process `t` test cases, each involving `m`, `x`, and a list `c`, and return results accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts and processes `t` test cases, each involving `m`, `x`, and a list `c`, and returns results accordingly.**
