Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. It then calculates the maximum number of consecutive indices `i` where the sum `s` (initialized to `m`) is greater than or equal to `l[i]`. During this process, it maintains a min-heap `h` to keep track of previously seen values that did not satisfy the condition `s >= l[i]`. If the current value `l[i]` is smaller than the smallest value in the heap, it replaces the smallest value in the heap with `l[i]` to maximize the number of consecutive valid indices. The function keeps track of the maximum count of such consecutive valid indices `mx` and stores these counts in a list `rs`. After processing all test cases, it prints the contents of `rs` one by one, separated by newlines. The function handles edge cases such as when the heap is empty or when `s` is less than `l[i]`.**
