`cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is equal to `s - l[i]`; `h` is a heap with an additional element `-l[i]`; `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `s` is equal to `s - l[i]`; `h` is a heap with an additional element `-l[i]`; `cnt` is increased by 1**
