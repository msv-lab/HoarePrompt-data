Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n > 0`
   - `i` is either 1 or 2
   - If `s` ≥ `l[i]`:
     - `i` is 2
     - `s` ≥ `l[2]`
     - `h` contains `-l[2]`
     - `cnt` is 1
     - `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1
   - If `s` < `l[1]`:
     - `i` is 1
     - `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`
     - `s` < `l[1] + 1`
   - Otherwise, `i` is 1, `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`, and `s` ≤ `l[1]`

2. Code Execution:
   - `s += m`

3. Analysis:
   - `s` is incremented by `m`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `h` remains unchanged (it does not get updated in this line).
   - The value of `cnt` remains unchanged (it does not get updated in this line).
   - The value of `mx` remains unchanged (it does not get updated in this line).

Since `s` is incremented by `m`, the condition checks related to `s` need to be re-evaluated.

4. Updated States:
   - `n > 0`
   - `i` is either 1 or 2
   - If `s` ≥ `l[i]`:
     - `i` is 2
     - `s` ≥ `l[2] + m`
     - `h` contains `-l[2]`
     - `cnt` is 1
     - `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1
   - If `s` < `l[1]`:
     - `i` is 1
     - `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`
     - `s` < `l[1] + 1 + m`
   - Otherwise, `i` is 1, `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`, and `s` ≤ `l[1] + m`

Output State: **`n > 0`, `i` is either 1 or 2, if `s` ≥ `l[i]`, then `i` is 2, `s` ≥ `l[2] + m`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1, if `s` < `l[1]`, then `i` is 1, `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`, and `s` < `l[1] + 1 + m`, otherwise, `i` is 1, `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`, and `s` ≤ `l[1] + m`**
