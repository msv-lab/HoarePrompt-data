Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n > 0 \)
   - \( i = 2 \)
   - \( s \) is its original value plus \( m \)
   - \( h \) contains \(-l[2]\)
   - \( cnt \) is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false
   - \( mx \) is the maximum of its initial value and 1

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   The loop will execute as long as \( i < n \). Given that \( i = 2 \) at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) must be incremented to 3, and the condition \( i < n \) must still hold true.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since \( i \) must be incremented by 1, the new value of \( i \) will be 3.
   - The condition \( n > 0 \) remains unchanged because it only depends on \( n \), and there's no information suggesting \( n \) changes within the loop.
   - The value of \( s \) being its original value plus \( m \) remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting \( s \) are specified.
   - The value of \( h \) containing \(-l[2]\) remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting \( h \) are specified.
   - The value of \( cnt \) (either 1 or 2) remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting \( cnt \) are specified.
   - The value of \( mx \) (the maximum of its initial value and 1) remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting \( mx \) are specified.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - \( n > 0 \)
   - \( i = 3 \)
   - \( s \) is its original value plus \( m \)
   - \( h \) contains \(-l[2]\)
   - \( cnt \) is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false
   - \( mx \) is the maximum of its initial value and 1

**State: **`n > 0, i is 3, s is its original value plus m, h contains -l[2], cnt is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false, mx is the maximum of its initial value and 1`**.
