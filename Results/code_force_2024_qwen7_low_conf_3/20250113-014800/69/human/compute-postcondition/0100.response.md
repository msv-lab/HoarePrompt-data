The code snippet reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `m` are now assigned specific integer values, but the values themselves are not known from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `m` is assigned the value of the second integer input, `s` is the sum of `m` added to itself `n` times minus the elements of `l` added to the heap `h` according to the conditions, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements of `l` that were added to it, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive additions of elements to the heap `h`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, `rs` is a list containing the value of `cnt`, and `k` is decremented by 1.**
