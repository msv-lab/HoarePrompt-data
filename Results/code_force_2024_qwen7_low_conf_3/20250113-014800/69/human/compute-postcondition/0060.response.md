The code `heapq.heappush(h, -l[i])` pushes the value `-l[i]` onto the heap `h`. Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is equal to `s - l[i]`.

- The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- The list `l` is used in the code, but its contents are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `l[i]`.
- The heap `h` is modified by pushing `-l[i]` onto it.

Thus, the updated states are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is equal to `s - l[i]`.
- `h` is now a heap with the additional element `-l[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `s` is equal to `s - l[i]`; `h` is a heap with an additional element `-l[i]`**
