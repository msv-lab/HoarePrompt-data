`s` is updated by adding `m` to its current value. The value of `m` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `s`. However, we know that `s` will be its original value plus `m`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `h`, `cnt`, and `mx`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` > 0, `i` is 2, `s` is its original value plus `m`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1.**
