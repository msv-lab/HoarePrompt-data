`earnings` is initially defined as `earnings - last_cost - costs[-1]`. The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` subtracts the last element of `costs` from `earnings`. Since `costs[-1]` is already part of the initial definition of `earnings`, subtracting it again will adjust `earnings` accordingly. The updated `earnings` will be `earnings - last_cost - costs[-1] - costs[-1]`, which simplifies to `earnings - last_cost - 2 * costs[-1]`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `m`, `x`, and the `happiness` list) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost - 2 * costs[-1]`, `costs` must have at least one element left, the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is two more than before**
