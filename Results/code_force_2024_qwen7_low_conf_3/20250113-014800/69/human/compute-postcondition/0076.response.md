`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `n`, `s`, `h`, `cnt_initial`, `k`, `mx_initial`, and the list `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is equal to `s + m - l[i]`, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`, the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + 1 + (k + 1)`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is equal to `s + m - l[i]`, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`, the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + 1 + (k + 1)`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`**
