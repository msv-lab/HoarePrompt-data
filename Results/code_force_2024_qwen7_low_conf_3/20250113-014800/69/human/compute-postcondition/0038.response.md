The `costs` list has its last element removed by the `pop()` method. Since `costs` originally contained all elements except the last one, after executing `costs.pop()`, `costs` will contain even fewer elements, specifically, it will now contain all elements except the last two.

The other variables (`i`, `earnings`, `m`, `x`, and `happiness`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost`, `costs` contains all elements except the last two, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is now a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is one more than before.
