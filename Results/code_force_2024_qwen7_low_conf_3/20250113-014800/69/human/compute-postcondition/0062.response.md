The code `mx = max(mx, cnt)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. Given the initial state, the only variables affected are `mx` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is increased by 1 in the initial state, `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`. The value of `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its original value (`mx`) and `cnt + 1`.

Since the initial value of `mx` is not specified, we denote it as `mx_initial`. Therefore, `mx` will be `max(mx_initial, cnt + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `s` is equal to `s - l[i]`; `h` is a heap with an additional element `-l[i]`; `cnt` is `cnt + 1`; `mx` is `max(mx_initial, cnt + 1)`**
