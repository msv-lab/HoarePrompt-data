The code `happiness.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Initially, `happiness` is given as `[happiness[0], 1, 1]`. After appending `1` to this list, the new state of `happiness` becomes `[happiness[0], 1, 1, 1]`.

The other variables (`i`, `earnings`, `costs`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `earnings` is `earnings - 2 * costs[-1]`, costs length must be at least 1, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1, 1, 1]`**
