The code `mx = max(mx, cnt)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is either 2 or 3, and `mx` is initially the maximum of its initial value and 1, `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of `mx` and `cnt`.

Since `cnt` is either 2 or 3, and both values are greater than 1, `mx` will be updated to be 3 if `cnt` is 3, and 2 if `cnt` is 2.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 3
- `s` is its original value minus `l[3]`
- `h` contains `-l[2]` and `-l[3]`
- `cnt` is either 2 or 3
- `mx` is 3 if `cnt` is 3, otherwise `mx` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `s` is its original value minus `l[3]`; `h` contains `-l[2]` and `-l[3]`; `cnt` is either 2 or 3; `mx` is 3 if `cnt` is 3, otherwise `mx` is 2.**
