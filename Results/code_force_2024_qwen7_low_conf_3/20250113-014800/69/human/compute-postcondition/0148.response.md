Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `rs` is a list containing the maximum count of consecutive valid indices where `s >= l[i]` for each iteration of the loop, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input strings, `mx` is the overall maximum count of such consecutive valid indices encountered during all iterations, `s` is the final value of `s` after processing all inputs, `cnt` is the count of valid indices where `s >= l[i]` during the entire execution of the loop, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements that satisfy `s >= l[i]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `i` is `n` since the loop iterates over all elements in `l`.**
