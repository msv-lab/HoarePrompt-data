`cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `h`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`, `s` is `s - l[i]`, `cnt` is increased by 1.
