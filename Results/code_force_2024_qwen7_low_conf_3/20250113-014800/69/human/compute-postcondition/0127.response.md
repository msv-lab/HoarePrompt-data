First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `n > 0`, `i` is 2, `s` â‰¥ `l[2] + m`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1.
- Code: `s += abs(h[0]) - l[i]`

Since `h` contains `-l[2]`, `h[0]` would be `-l[2]`. Also, since `i` is 2, `l[i]` would be `l[2]`.

Let's substitute these values into the code:

```python
s += abs(-l[2]) - l[2]
```

Given that `abs(-l[2])` is simply `abs(l[2])`, the code simplifies to:

```python
s += abs(l[2]) - l[2]
```

This means `s` is updated by adding `abs(l[2]) - l[2]` to its current value. 

The value of `abs(l[2]) - l[2]` depends on whether `l[2]` is positive or negative:
- If `l[2]` is positive, `abs(l[2])` is `l[2]`, so `abs(l[2]) - l[2]` is 0.
- If `l[2]` is negative, `abs(l[2])` is `-l[2]`, so `abs(l[2]) - l[2]` is `-l[2] - l[2]` which is `-2 * l[2]`.

Since `l[2]` is not specified as positive or negative in the initial state, we can't simplify further without this detail. However, the value of `s` will be adjusted accordingly.

Now, let's summarize the output state:

- `n > 0` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `s` is updated by adding `abs(l[2]) - l[2]` to its current value.
- `h` remains `-l[2]`.
- `cnt` is 1 (unchanged).
- `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1 (unchanged).

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n > 0`, `i` is 2, `s` is updated by adding `abs(l[2]) - l[2]` to its current value, `h` is `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1.**
