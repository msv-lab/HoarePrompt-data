According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The initial values of other variables (`m`, `s`, `h`, `cnt`, `mx`, `rs`, `k`, and `l`) do not affect whether the loop can execute. However, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Given the state before the loop:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- `s` is 0
- `h` is an empty list
- `cnt` is 0
- `mx` is 0
- `rs` is a list containing the value of `cnt`
- `k` is decremented by 1
- `l` is updated with the new list of integers from the input

The key variable for the loop to execute is `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
