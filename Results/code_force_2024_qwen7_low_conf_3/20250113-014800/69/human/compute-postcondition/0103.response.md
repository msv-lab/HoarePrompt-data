`s` is assigned the value 0. The value of `s` is now explicitly set to 0, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `s` is 0, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements of `l` that were added to it, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive additions of elements to the heap `h`, `mx` is 0, `rs` is a list containing the value of `cnt`, and `k` is decremented by 1; `l` is updated with the new list of integers from the input.**
