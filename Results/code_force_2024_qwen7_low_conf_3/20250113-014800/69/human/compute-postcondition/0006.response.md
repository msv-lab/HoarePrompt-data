`earnings` is initially equal to `x`. The code subtracts `costs[-1]` from `earnings`. Since `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `costs[-1]` is the largest element in the list. Therefore, `earnings` becomes `x - costs[-1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is `x - costs[-1]`, `happiness` is an empty list, `i` is 1.**
