`rs.append(cnt)` appends the current value of `cnt` to the list `rs`. The value of `rs` was not previously defined, so it is created as an empty list initially. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged after this operation. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `h`, and `mx`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `l`, `s` is the sum of `m` added to itself `n` times minus the elements of `l` added to the heap `h` according to the conditions, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements of `l` that were added to it, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive additions of elements to the heap `h`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, and `rs` is a list containing the value of `cnt`.**
