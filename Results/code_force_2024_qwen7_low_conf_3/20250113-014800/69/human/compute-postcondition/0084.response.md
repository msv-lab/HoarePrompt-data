`s` is updated by adding `m` to its current value. Based on the initial conditions, the value of `s` depends on whether `s >= l[i]` or `s < l[i]`. However, since `m` is added to `s`, the new value of `s` will be `s + m`. The other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is equal to `s + m`, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + 1 + (k + 1)` if `s >= l[i]` or `cnt_initial + (k + 1)` if `s < l[i]`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`**
