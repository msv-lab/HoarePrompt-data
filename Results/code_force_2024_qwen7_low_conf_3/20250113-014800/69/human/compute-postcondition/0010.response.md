The code subtracts the last element of the `costs` list from `earnings`. Initially, `earnings` is defined as `x - costs[-1]`. After the subtraction, `earnings` becomes `x - costs[-1] - costs[-1]`, which simplifies to `x - 2 * costs[-1]`.

The states of the other variables (`m`, `x`, `costs`, `happiness`, and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order with the last element removed, `earnings` is `x - 2 * costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1]`, `i` is 1**
