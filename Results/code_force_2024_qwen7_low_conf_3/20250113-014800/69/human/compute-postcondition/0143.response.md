Postcondition: ***`n > 0`, `i` is 3, `s` is its original value plus `m` plus `abs(l[2]) - l[3]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is true, otherwise `s` remains as its original value plus `m`. `h` is a heap with an additional element `-l[3]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is true, otherwise `h` remains as it was. `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false. `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1.***
