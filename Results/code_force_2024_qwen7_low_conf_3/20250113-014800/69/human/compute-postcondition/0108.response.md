`s` is decremented by `l[i]`. The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to `l[i]`. Since `s` is greater than or equal to `l[1]`, subtracting `l[1]` from `s` will still keep `s` greater than or equal to 0 (as `n` must be greater than 0).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 0**
