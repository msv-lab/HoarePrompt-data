Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `s` is the sum of its original value and either `-l[3]` or `m + abs(l[2]) - l[3]` based on the condition `s >= l[i]`. `h` is a heap containing elements `-l[2]` and `-l[3]` if the condition is false, or `-l[2]` and possibly `-l[3]` if the condition is true. `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false. `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1, which remains 2 or 3 based on the value of `cnt` after the condition evaluation.***
