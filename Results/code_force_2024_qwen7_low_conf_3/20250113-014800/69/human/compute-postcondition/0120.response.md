Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2. If `s` is greater than or equal to `l[i]`, then `i` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to `l[2]`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1. If `s` is less than `l[1]`, then `i` is 1, `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`, and `s` is less than `l[1] + 1`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`, and `s` is less than or equal to `l[1]` with the same postcondition as the precondition.**
