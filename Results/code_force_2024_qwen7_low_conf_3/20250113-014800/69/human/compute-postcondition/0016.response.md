`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the list `costs`. Since `costs` was unchanged in the initial state, it means `costs` originally contained at least one element. After executing `costs.pop()`, the last element of `costs` is removed. 

The initial state also mentions that `earnings` is now `earnings - costs[-1]`, which means `earnings` was updated using the last element of `costs`. However, since `costs.pop()` has removed this element, `costs[-1]` no longer exists.

Therefore, the output state is: `earnings` is now `earnings - costs[-1]` (the value of `earnings` has been updated but the specific value is not known), `costs` remains unchanged except that its last element has been removed, and `happiness` is `[1]`.

Output State: **`earnings` is now `earnings - costs[-1]`, `costs` remains unchanged except that its last element has been removed, `happiness` is `[1]`**
