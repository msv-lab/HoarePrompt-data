`s` is decremented by `l[i]`. Since `s` was initially equal to `s + m`, the new value of `s` is now `s + m - l[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `s` is equal to `s + m - l[i]`, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the smallest of `-l[i]` and the previous elements, the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + (k + 1)`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`**
