The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` subtracts the last element of the `costs` list from `earnings`. Since `costs` must contain at least one element, let's denote the last element of `costs` as `last_cost`.

- Before the operation, `earnings` is the final value after subtracting all elements in `costs` that are less than or equal to `earnings` plus `x`.
- After the operation, `earnings` will be updated to `earnings - last_cost`.

The other variables (`i`, `m`, `x`, `happiness`) remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is initially 3 and does not get modified by this code, and the other variables (`m`, `x`, `happiness`) remain the same, the output state will be:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost`, `costs` contains all elements except the last one, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1]` where the number of `1`s is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `earnings` must be greater than or equal to the last element popped from `costs` during the last iteration of the loop (if any elements were popped).**
