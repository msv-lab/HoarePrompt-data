The code `happiness.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Given the initial state where `happiness` is a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1]` where the number of `1`s is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and assuming no elements were popped from `costs` during the last iteration (since no specific action was taken in the code snippet provided), the number of `1`s in `happiness` increases by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost`, `costs` contains all elements except the last one, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is now a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is one more than before.**
