Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m` (the total number of months), `x` (the monthly salary), and `costs` (a list of positive integers representing the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in each month). The function first sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates over each month, incrementing the `earnings` by the monthly salary `x`. During each iteration, it checks if the last element of the `costs` list is less than or equal to the current `earnings`. If true, it reduces `earnings` by the cost, appends a `1` to the `happiness` list, and removes the cost from the `costs` list. After processing all months, the function returns the length of the `happiness` list, which is always equal to `m`, and the `happiness` list itself, which contains `m` ones.**

This functionality covers the following aspects:
- The function sorts the `costs` list in descending order.
- It iterates over each month, updating `earnings` by adding `x` and reducing it by costs up to the point where `earnings` are insufficient.
- It populates the `happiness` list with `1`s, indicating successful acquisition of happiness units within the budget constraints.
- The final state of the program after the function concludes is such that `i` is `m`, `earnings` is the final value after adjustments, `costs` is an empty list, `m` and `x` remain unchanged, and `happiness` is a list containing `m` ones.

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If the `costs` list is initially empty, no elements will be processed, and `earnings` will simply increase by `x * m`.
- The function always returns `m` and a list of `m` ones, regardless of the `costs` values or their effect on `earnings`.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not modify the original `costs` list outside of the sorting operation. However, since the problem statement does not specify any requirement to preserve the original `costs` order, this is acceptable.
