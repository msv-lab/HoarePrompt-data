`s` is updated by adding `m` to its current value. The initial value of `s` depends on the condition `s >= l[i]`, where `i` is 3, and the condition is evaluated using either `-l[3]` or `m + abs(l[2]) - l[3]`. Since the exact values of `l[2]` and `l[3]` are not given, we keep them in their symbolic form. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `s` is the sum of its original value and `m`, `h` is a heap containing elements `-l[2]` and `-l[3]` if the condition is false, or `-l[2]` and possibly `-l[3]` if the condition is true, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false, `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1, which remains 2 or 3 based on the value of `cnt` after the condition evaluation.**
