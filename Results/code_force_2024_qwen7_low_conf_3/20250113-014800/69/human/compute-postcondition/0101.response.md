The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a space-separated string of integers as input and converts each element into an integer, storing them in the list `l`. This directly affects the variable `l`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input,
- `m` is assigned the value of the second integer input,
- `s` is the sum of `m` added to itself `n` times minus the elements of `l` added to the heap `h` according to the conditions,
- `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements of `l` that were added to it,
- `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive additions of elements to the heap `h`,
- `mx` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution,
- `rs` is a list containing the value of `cnt`,
- `k` is decremented by 1.

After executing the line `l = list(map(int, input().split()))`:
- `l` is updated with the new list of integers from the input,
- All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `m` is assigned the value of the second integer input, `s` is the sum of `m` added to itself `n` times minus the elements of `l` added to the heap `h` according to the conditions, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements of `l` that were added to it, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive additions of elements to the heap `h`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, `rs` is a list containing the value of `cnt`, and `k` is decremented by 1; `l` is updated with the new list of integers from the input.**
