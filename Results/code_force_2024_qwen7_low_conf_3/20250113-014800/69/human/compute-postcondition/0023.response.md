`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since `costs` remains non-empty, the length of `costs` decreases by 1, and the last element is removed. The other variables (`i`, `earnings`, `m`, `x`, and `happiness`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `earnings` is reduced by `costs[-1]`; `costs` length is one less than before; `m` remains the same; `x` remains the same; `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1]`; `earnings` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
