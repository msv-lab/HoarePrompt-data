Step-by-step analysis:

1. Initial State:
   - `n > 0`
   - `i` is 3
   - `s` is its original value plus `m`
   - `h` contains `-l[2]`
   - `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false
   - `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1

2. Code: `s += abs(h[0]) - l[i]`

   - The value of `s` is updated by adding `abs(h[0]) - l[i]` to its current value.
   - Since `i` is 3, `l[i]` refers to `l[3]`.
   - The value of `h` is `-l[2]`, so `h[0]` is the same as `-l[2]`.

3. Calculate the new value of `s`:
   - The expression `abs(h[0])` becomes `abs(-l[2])`, which simplifies to `abs(-l[2]) = abs(l[2])`.
   - So, `s` becomes `s + abs(l[2]) - l[3]`.

4. Variables unchanged:
   - `n > 0`
   - `i` remains 3
   - `h` remains `-l[2]`
   - `cnt` remains either 1 or 2
   - `mx` remains the maximum of its initial value and 1

Output State: **`n > 0`, `i` is 3, `s` is its original value plus `m` plus `abs(l[2]) - l[3]`, `h` is `-l[2]`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false, `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1**
