The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` subtracts the last element of the list `costs` from the variable `earnings`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `earnings` and `costs`, let's denote the last element of `costs` as `costs[-1]`.

The impact of this operation is that `earnings` is updated by subtracting `costs[-1]` from its current value.

Output State: **`earnings` is now `earnings - costs[-1]`, `costs` remains unchanged**
