The `costs.pop()` function removes the last element from the `costs` list. The initial state tells us that `costs` must have at least one element left, and the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`. After popping the last element, the length of the `costs` list decreases by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` is still 3.
- `earnings` is still defined as `earnings - last_cost - 2 * costs[-1]`.
- `m` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `happiness` is updated to be a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is three more than before.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost - 2 * costs[-1]`, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `costs` has one less element than before.**
