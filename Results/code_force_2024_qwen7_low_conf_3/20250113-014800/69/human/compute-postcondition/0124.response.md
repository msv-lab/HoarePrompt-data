The code `heapq.heappush(h, -l[i])` impacts the heap `h`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `l[i]` is `l[2]`. Since `h` contains `-l[2]`, and now we push `-l[i]` (which is `-l[2]`) into the heap, the heap remains unchanged because the same value is being added.

The initial state includes `n > 0`, `i` is 2, `s` is `s - l[2]`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1. After the code execution, the heap `h` will still contain `-l[2]`.

Output State: **`n > 0`, `i` is 2, `s` is `s - l[2]`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 1, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1**
