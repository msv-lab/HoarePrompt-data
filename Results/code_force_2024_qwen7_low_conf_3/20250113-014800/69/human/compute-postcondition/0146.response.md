Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `h` is a heap containing negative values of selected elements from `l`, `cnt` is the maximum count of valid selections (elements added to the heap), and `mx` is the maximum value of `cnt` during the iterations, `rs` is a list of values of `cnt` at each iteration, `k` is decremented by the number of iterations, `l` is the updated list of integers from the input.**
