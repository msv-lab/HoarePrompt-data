Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s` is less than `l[i]` and equal to `s + m`.
- `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the smallest of `-l[i]` and the previous elements.
- The current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `cnt + 1`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is an index that starts from 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Heap `h`:**
   - The heap `h` contains elements such that the smallest element is the minimum of `-l[i]` and the previous elements.
   - The heap properties must hold true for the next iteration.

4. **Variable `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, `cnt` will be `cnt_initial + (k + 1)` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Variable `mx`:**
   - `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `cnt + 1`.
   - Since `cnt` is incremented by 1, `mx` will be the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`.

### Adjusted States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- The condition `i < n` must still hold true.
- `s` will remain the same since it depends on `l[i]` which changes with `i`.
- The heap `h` must still satisfy its properties.
- `cnt` will be `cnt_initial + (k + 1)`.
- `mx` will be the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is less than `l[i]` and equal to `s + m`, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the smallest of `-l[i]` and the previous elements, the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + (k + 1)`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`**.
