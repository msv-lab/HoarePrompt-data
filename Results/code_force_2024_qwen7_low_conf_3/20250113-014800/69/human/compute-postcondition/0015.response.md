The code `happiness.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `happiness`, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `1`, the list `happiness` will contain `[1]`.

The initial state also mentions that `earnings` is equal to `earnings - costs[-1]`. This value is unchanged by the code since no further operations on `earnings` are specified, and `costs` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`earnings` is now `earnings - costs[-1]`, `costs` remains unchanged, `happiness` is `[1]`**
