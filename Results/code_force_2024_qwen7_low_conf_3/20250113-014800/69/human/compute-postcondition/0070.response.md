Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is less than `l[i]`. After the execution of the if-else block, `n` is still greater than 0, `s` remains less than `l[i]`, and `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the smallest of `-l[i]` and the previous elements, and the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`.***
