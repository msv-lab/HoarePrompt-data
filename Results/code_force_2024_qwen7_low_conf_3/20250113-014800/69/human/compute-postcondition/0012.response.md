The code `costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since the `costs` list is initially a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, removing the last element will update the `costs` list. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order with the last element removed, `earnings` is `x - 2 * costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 1**
