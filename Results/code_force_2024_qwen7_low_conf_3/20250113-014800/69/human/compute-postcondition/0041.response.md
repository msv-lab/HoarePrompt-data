The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Given the initial state where `happiness` is a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1]` with the number of `1`s being one more than before, appending another `1` increases the number of `1`s by one. Therefore, the updated `happiness` list will have two more `1`s than `happiness[0]`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `earnings`, `costs`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost - costs[-1]`, `costs` must contain at least one element, the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is now a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is two more than before**
