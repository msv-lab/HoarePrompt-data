The code `happiness.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the `happiness` list. Initially, `happiness` is a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1]` with two more `1`s than before. After appending another `1`, the number of `1`s in the list increases by one, making it three more `1`s than `happiness[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost - 2 * costs[-1]`, costs must have at least one element left, the last element of costs must be less than or equal to earnings, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is three more than before**
