The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` means that `earnings` is decreased by the last element of the `costs` list. Given the initial state, `earnings` is defined as `earnings - last_cost`, and the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`. This means that `earnings` is reduced by the last element of `costs`.

The initial state is:
- `i` is 3
- `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost`
- `costs` must contain at least one element, and the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`
- `m` remains the same
- `x` remains the same
- `happiness` is now a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is one more than before

After executing the code `earnings -= costs[-1]`, the value of `earnings` will be updated to `earnings - costs[-1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost - costs[-1]`, `costs` must contain at least one element, the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is now a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is one more than before**
