Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is either equal to `s - l[i]` if `s >= l[i]` or less than `l[i]` if `s < l[i]`. After the execution of the if-else block, `n` is still greater than 0, `s` is less than `l[i]`, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the smallest of `-l[i]` and the previous elements, and the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`. `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `cnt + 1`.***
