The code snippet updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. Given the initial state, the value of `cnt` is increased by 1, but the exact value of `mx` before this line is not specified. Since `cnt` is increased by 1, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`, `s` is `s - l[i]`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt + 1**
