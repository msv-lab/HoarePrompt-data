`earnings` is decreased by the last element of the list `costs`. Since `costs` is non-empty, it has at least one element. However, the specific value of `costs[-1]` is not given, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `earnings`. But we know that `earnings` must still be greater than or equal to its initial value plus 2, which is 4.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `earnings` is reduced by `costs[-1]`; `costs` remains non-empty; `m` remains the same; `x` remains the same; `happiness` remains the same; `earnings` must be greater than or equal to 4.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `earnings` is reduced by `costs[-1]`; `costs` remains non-empty; `m` remains the same; `x` remains the same; `happiness` remains the same; `earnings` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
