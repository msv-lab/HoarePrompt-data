Postcondition: ***`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is `s + abs(h[0]) - l[i]`, `h` is a heap with the smallest element `-l[i]` removed, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + 1 + (k + 1)` if `s >= l[i]` or `cnt_initial + (k + 1)` if `s < l[i]`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`. Since the else part does not change these variables' states, the overall postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
