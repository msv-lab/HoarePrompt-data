The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` updates the `earnings` by subtracting the last element of the `costs` list from it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2
- `earnings` is initially defined as `earnings - costs[-1]`, which means `earnings` is already reduced by the last element of `costs`.
- `costs` length must be at least 1
- `m` remains the same
- `x` remains the same
- `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1, 1]`

Since `earnings` was already adjusted in the initial state, the only change is that `earnings` is further reduced by the last element of `costs`. The output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `earnings` is `earnings - 2 * costs[-1]`, `costs` length must be at least 1, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1, 1]`**
