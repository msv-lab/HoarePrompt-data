Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is less than `l[i]` and equal to `s + m`, `h` is a heap with `-l[i]` as one of its elements, `cnt` is `cnt_initial + (k + 1)`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part in the if-else block, the postcondition directly follows from the if part. The if condition ensures that if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` holds true, then `h` will contain `-l[i]` in addition to its previous elements, which is already captured in the if part's postcondition. Thus, the overall postcondition remains the same as the if part's postcondition.
