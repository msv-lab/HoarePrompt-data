The code sets `mx` to 0. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `mx`. The output state includes the updated value of `mx` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `m` is assigned the value of the second integer input, `s` is the sum of `m` added to itself `n` times minus the elements of `l` added to the heap `h` according to the conditions, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements of `l` that were added to it, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive additions of elements to the heap `h`, `mx` is 0, `rs` is a list containing the value of `cnt`, and `k` is decremented by 1; `l` is updated with the new list of integers from the input.**
