The code snippet `rs.append(cnt)` appends the current value of `cnt` to the list `rs`. This does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `s`, `h`, `mx`, `k`, or `l`. The value of `cnt` is added to `rs`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `h` is a heap containing negative values of selected elements from `l`, `cnt` is the current count of valid selections, `mx` is the maximum value of `cnt` during the iterations, `rs` is a list of values of `cnt` at each iteration with the latest value being appended, `k` is decremented by the number of iterations, and `l` is the updated list of integers from the input.**
