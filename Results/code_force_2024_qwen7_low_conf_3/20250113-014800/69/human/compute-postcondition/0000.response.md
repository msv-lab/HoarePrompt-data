The code `costs.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the `costs` list in descending order. This means that the highest costs will be at the beginning of the list, and the lowest costs will be at the end.

- The `m` and `x` variables are not affected by this operation.
- The `costs` list is sorted in reverse (descending) order.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, and `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.**
