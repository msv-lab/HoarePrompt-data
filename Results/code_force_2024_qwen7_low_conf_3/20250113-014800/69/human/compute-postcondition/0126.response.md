The code updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. Given the initial state, `cnt` is 2. Since `mx` is initially the maximum of its initial value and 1, it means `mx` is at least 1. However, since `cnt` is 2, which is greater than 1, `mx` will be updated to 2.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `h`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` > 0, `i` is 2, `s` is `s - l[2]`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 2, and `mx` is 2**
