`happiness` is appended with the value `1`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `earnings` is reduced by `costs[-1]`; `costs` remains non-empty; `m` remains the same; `x` remains the same; `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1]`; `earnings` must be greater than or equal to 4.
