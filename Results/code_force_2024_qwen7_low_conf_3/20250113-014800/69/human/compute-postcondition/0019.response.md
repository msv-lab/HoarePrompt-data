`earnings` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since `x` remains the same and was initially 2, `earnings` is increased by 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `m`, `x`, `costs`, `earnings`, `happiness`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `costs` remains the same, `earnings` is `earnings + 2`, `happiness` remains the same.**
