The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The output state will include the updated value of `l`, which is a list of integers derived from the new input string. The other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is a new input integer, `x` is 1, `rs` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `mx` is 0, `s` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `h` is an empty heap, `n` is the length of the new list `l`, and `i` is 0, `m` is a new input integer**
