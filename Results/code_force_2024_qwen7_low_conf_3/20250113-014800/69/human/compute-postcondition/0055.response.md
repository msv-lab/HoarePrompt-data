`cnt` is assigned the value 0, which was its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is a new input integer, `x` is 1, `rs` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `mx` is 0, `s` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `h` is an empty heap, `n` is the length of the new list `l`, and `i` is 0.
