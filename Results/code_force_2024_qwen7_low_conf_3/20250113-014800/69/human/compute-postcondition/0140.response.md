The `heapq.heappop(h)` function removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `h`, we cannot determine the exact value of the element popped. However, we know that `h` is now one element smaller.

The output state will be:
- `n > 0` (since this is a precondition and not affected by the operation)
- `i` is 3 (since this is a precondition and not affected by the operation)
- `s` is its original value plus `m` plus `abs(l[2]) - l[3]` (since this is a precondition and not affected by the operation)
- `h` is now a heap without its smallest element (the exact smallest element is not specified)
- `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false (since this is a precondition and not affected by the operation)
- `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1 (since this is a precondition and not affected by the operation)

Output State: **`n > 0`, `i` is 3, `s` is its original value plus `m` plus `abs(l[2]) - l[3]`, `h` is now a heap without its smallest element, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false, `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1**
