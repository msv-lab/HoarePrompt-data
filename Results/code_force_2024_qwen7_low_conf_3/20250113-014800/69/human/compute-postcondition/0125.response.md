`cnt` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 1, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `h`, and `mx`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n > 0`, `i` is 2, `s` is `s - l[2]`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is 2, and `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1**
