`s` is assigned the value of `s - l[i]`. Since `i` is 3, this means `s` is updated to `s - l[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n > 0`, `i` is 3, `s` is its original value minus `l[3]`, `h` contains `-l[2]`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false, `mx` is the maximum of its initial value and 1.
