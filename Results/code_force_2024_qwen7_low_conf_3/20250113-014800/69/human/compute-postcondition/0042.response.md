`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since the last element is removed, the updated `costs` list will have one less element. The `earnings` variable is not affected by this operation, and the other variables (`i`, `m`, `x`, and `happiness`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `earnings` is `earnings - last_cost - costs[-1]`, `costs` has at least one element less than before, the last element of `costs` was less than or equal to `earnings`, `m` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `happiness` is a list containing `[happiness[0], 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1]` where the number of `1`s is two more than before**
