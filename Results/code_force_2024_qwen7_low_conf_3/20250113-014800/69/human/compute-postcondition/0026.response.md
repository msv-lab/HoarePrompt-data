The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Initially, `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1]`, which means it starts with two elements: the first element is `happiness[0]` and the second element is `1`. After appending `1`, the list `happiness` will have three elements: the first element is `happiness[0]`, the second element is `1`, and the third element is `1`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `earnings`, `costs`, `m`, and `x`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`; `costs` length is one less than before; `m` remains the same; `x` remains the same; `happiness` is `[happiness[0], 1, 1]`.**
