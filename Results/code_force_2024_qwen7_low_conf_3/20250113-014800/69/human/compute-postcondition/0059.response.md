`s` is decremented by `l[i]`. The initial state is that `n` must be greater than 0 and `s` is greater than or equal to the current value of `l[i]`. After executing `s -= l[i]`, the value of `s` will be `s - l[i]`, which is still greater than or equal to 0 since `s` was initially greater than or equal to `l[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `s` is equal to `s - l[i]`**
