Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months.
   - `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary.
   - `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order with all elements that were less than or equal to `earnings` removed.
   - `earnings` is the original `x` minus the sum of those removed elements.
   - `happiness` is a list containing 1 for each iteration the loop executed.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` was 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be less than `m + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `m + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is now 2, we need to ensure that `i < m + 1`.
   - All other states (`m`, `x`, `costs`, `earnings`, `happiness`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting these variables are mentioned.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `costs` remains the same.
   - `earnings` remains the same.
   - `happiness` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `m` is the same, `x` is the same, `costs` is the same, `earnings` is the same, `happiness` is the same**
