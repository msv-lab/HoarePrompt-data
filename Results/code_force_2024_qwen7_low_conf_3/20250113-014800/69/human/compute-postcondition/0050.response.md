The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m`, `x`, and `costs`. `m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, and `costs` is a list of positive integers where `costs[i]` represents the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in the i-th month. After executing the function body, the function returns `m`, which is the number of months, and `happiness`, which is a list containing `m` ones. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept `m`, `x`, and `costs` and return `m` and a list of `m` ones.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `m`, `x`, and `costs`, and returns `m` and a list containing `m` ones.**
