`s` is updated by adding `m` to its current value. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `l`, `h`, `cnt`, `mx`, `cnt_initial`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated according to the condition: if `s >= l[i]`, then `s` becomes `s - l[i]`; otherwise, `s` becomes `s + abs(h[0]) - l[i]`. `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the minimum of the current smallest element and `-l[i]`. `cnt` is either `cnt + 1` or `cnt_initial + 1 + (k + 1)` depending on the condition `s >= l[i]`. `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt + 1` or `mx_initial` and `(cnt_initial + (k + 1)) + 1`; `s` is updated by adding `m` to its current value.
