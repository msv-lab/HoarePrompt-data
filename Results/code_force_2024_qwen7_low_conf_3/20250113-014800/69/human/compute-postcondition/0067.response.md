The `heapq.heappop(h)` function pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. This operation modifies the heap `h` by removing its smallest element. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact state of `h` is not specified, we only know that the smallest element has been removed.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is less than `l[i]` + 1, the value of `h` is now a heap without its smallest element, the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`.**
