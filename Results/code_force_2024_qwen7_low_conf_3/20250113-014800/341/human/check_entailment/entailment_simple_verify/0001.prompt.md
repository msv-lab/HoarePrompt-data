You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been asked to organize a very important art conference. The first
step is to choose the dates.

The conference must last for a certain number of consecutive days. Each day,
one lecturer must perform, and the same lecturer cannot perform more than
once.

You asked n potential lecturers if they could participate in the conference.
Lecturer i indicated that they could perform on any day from l_i to r_i
inclusive.

A certain segment of days can be chosen as the conference dates if there is a
way to assign an available lecturer to each day of the segment, assigning each
lecturer to no more than one day.

For each k from 1 to n , find how many ways there are to choose a segment of k
consecutive days as the conference dates.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer n — the number of potential
lecturers (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Each of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i — the segment of
available days for the i th lecturer (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Output

Print n integers, where the k th number denotes the number of ways to select a
segment of k consecutive days as conference dates.

Note

In the first testcase, a one-day conference can be organized on any of the
days from 1 to 6 . A two-day conference can be organized from day 2 to day 3 ,
as well as from day 4 to day 5 .

In the second testcase, five lecturers can perform only from day 1 to day 3 ,
so it will not be possible to organize a conference longer than three days.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then parses the input to extract the number of lecturers (`n`) and their availability intervals (`l_i`, `r_i`).

2. **Data Structure**:
   - The availability of each lecturer is stored using a prefix sum array approach, which efficiently computes the number of available lecturers at any given day.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The availability array is constructed to store the cumulative number of available lecturers up to each day. This is done correctly using a loop that iterates through each day and updates the availability array based on the intervals provided.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - For each length `k` from 1 to `n`, the program calculates the number of valid segments of `k` consecutive days.
   - It uses a sliding window technique to check all possible segments of `k` consecutive days and counts how many of these segments have at least `k` available lecturers.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases appropriately by ensuring that the sliding window calculations do not go out of bounds.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The final results are printed in the correct format, with each value separated by spaces.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary cases without errors, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
