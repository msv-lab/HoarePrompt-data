Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Availability Calculation**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and parses the number of lecturers `n` and their availability ranges \((l_i, r_i)\).
   - The availability array is constructed correctly by incrementing the start day and decrementing the next day of each lecturer's availability period. This ensures that the net availability of lecturers is tracked over time.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The cumulative sum of availability over each day is computed correctly using the `available_days` array. This step ensures that we know the number of available lecturers up to any given day.

3. **Window Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over all possible window sizes \(k\) from 1 to \(n\).
   - For each \(k\), it calculates the number of valid windows of length \(k\) where at least one lecturer is available each day.
   - The calculation of `current_window_sum` and its comparison with \(k\) ensures that the function correctly counts valid windows.

4. **Boundary Conditions and Logic**:
   - The program handles the boundaries and logic correctly, ensuring that windows are properly checked without overlapping and that the count of valid windows is accurate.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the results correctly, providing the number of valid windows for each \(k\) from 1 to \(n\).

Given that the program correctly follows the outlined steps and logic to solve the problem, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
