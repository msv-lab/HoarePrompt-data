You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have been asked to organize a very important art conference. The first
step is to choose the dates.

The conference must last for a certain number of consecutive days. Each day,
one lecturer must perform, and the same lecturer cannot perform more than
once.

You asked n potential lecturers if they could participate in the conference.
Lecturer i indicated that they could perform on any day from l_i to r_i
inclusive.

A certain segment of days can be chosen as the conference dates if there is a
way to assign an available lecturer to each day of the segment, assigning each
lecturer to no more than one day.

For each k from 1 to n , find how many ways there are to choose a segment of k
consecutive days as the conference dates.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer n — the number of potential
lecturers (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Each of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i — the segment of
available days for the i th lecturer (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Output

Print n integers, where the k th number denotes the number of ways to select a
segment of k consecutive days as conference dates.

Note

In the first testcase, a one-day conference can be organized on any of the
days from 1 to 6 . A two-day conference can be organized from day 2 to day 3 ,
as well as from day 4 to day 5 .

In the second testcase, five lecturers can perform only from day 1 to day 3 ,
so it will not be possible to organize a conference longer than three days.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
lecturers = []
index = 1
for _ in range(n):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    lecturers.append((l, r))
    index += 2
result = func_1(n, lecturers)
print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. lecturers is a list of pairs (l_i, r_i), where each pair represents the range of days [l_i, r_i] (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2·10^5) that the i-th lecturer is available to perform.
def func_1(n, lecturers):
    max_day = 200000
    availability = [0] * (max_day + 2)
    for (l, r) in lecturers:
        availability[l] += 1
        
        availability[r + 1] -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), and `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0.
    current_available = 0
    available_days = [0] * (max_day + 1)
    for day in range(1, max_day + 1):
        current_available += availability[day]
        
        available_days[day] = current_available
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0, `current_available` is the sum of all `availability[i]` for `i` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days` is a list of length 200001 where each element is the cumulative sum of `availability[i]` from 1 to `i`, and `day` is `max_day + 1`.
    result = [0] * (n + 1)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        count = 0
        
        current_window_sum = sum(available_days[1:k + 1])
        
        if current_window_sum >= k:
            count += 1
        
        for start in range(2, max_day - k + 2):
            current_window_sum += available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[
                start - 1]
            if current_window_sum >= k:
                count += 1
        
        result[k] = count
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `start` is in the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`, `count` is the total number of times `current_window_sum` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `current_window_sum` is the sum of the last `k` elements starting from `available_days[start - 1]`, and `result[k]` is equal to `count`.
    return result[1:]
    #`The program returns a list containing the values of `result` starting from index 1 to the end

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
