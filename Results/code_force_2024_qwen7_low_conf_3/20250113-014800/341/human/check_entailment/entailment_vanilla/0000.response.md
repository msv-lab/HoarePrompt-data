Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then parses the input to extract the number of lecturers (`n`) and their availability intervals (`l_i`, `r_i`).

2. **Data Structure**:
   - The availability of each lecturer is stored using a prefix sum array approach, which efficiently computes the number of available lecturers at any given day.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The availability array is constructed to store the cumulative number of available lecturers up to each day. This is done correctly using a loop that iterates through each day and updates the availability array based on the intervals provided.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - For each length `k` from 1 to `n`, the program calculates the number of valid segments of `k` consecutive days.
   - It uses a sliding window technique to check all possible segments of `k` consecutive days and counts how many of these segments have at least `k` available lecturers.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases appropriately by ensuring that the sliding window calculations do not go out of bounds.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The final results are printed in the correct format, with each value separated by spaces.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary cases without errors, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
