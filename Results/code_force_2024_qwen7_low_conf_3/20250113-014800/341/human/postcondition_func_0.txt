The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of pairs representing lecturer availability. It calculates and returns a list of integers, where the `k`-th element (starting from index 1) indicates the number of non-overlapping windows of length `k` that can be formed within the given lecturer availability periods. Each window must have at least one lecturer available.
