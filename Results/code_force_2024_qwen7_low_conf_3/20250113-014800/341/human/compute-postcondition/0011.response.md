Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the `availability` list after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

### Initial State
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), where each pair represents the range of days \([l_i, r_i]\) that the \(i\)-th lecturer is available.
- `max_day` is 200000.
- `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros.

### Loop Code
```
for l, r in lecturers:
    availability[l] += 1
    availability[r + 1] -= 1
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **Incrementing Availability**: For each lecturer \((l_i, r_i)\), the value at index `l_i` in the `availability` list is incremented by 1.
2. **Decrementing Availability**: The value at index `r_i + 1` in the `availability` list is decremented by 1.

### Understanding the Impact on the `availability` List
- The increment at `availability[l]` and decrement at `availability[r + 1]` effectively count the number of lecturers available for each day from `l` to `r`.
- The `availability` list will store the net number of lecturers available for each day, starting from index 1 up to index `max_day`.

### Final State Calculation
After all iterations of the loop, the `availability` list will reflect the cumulative effect of all the increments and decrements due to the lecturers' availability ranges. Specifically:
- For each day \(d\) within the range \([l_i, r_i]\), the value at index \(d\) in the `availability` list will be incremented by 1 for every lecturer whose availability range includes day \(d\).
- For each day \(d = r_i + 1\), the value at index \(d\) will be decremented by 1, ensuring that the count resets after the last day of the availability range.

### Output State After All Iterations
Given the nature of the loop and the operations performed, the `availability` list will contain the net number of lecturers available for each day from 1 to `max_day`. Therefore, the final state of the `availability` list will reflect the cumulative availability of lecturers across all given ranges.

**Output State:**
- `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\).
- `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, considering all the ranges specified by the `lecturers` list.
- `availability[200001]` and `availability[200002]` will be 0 because there are no ranges extending past `max_day`.

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), and `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0.**
