The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `lecturers`, which is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\) where each pair represents the range of days \([l_i, r_i]\) (with \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) that the \(i\)-th lecturer is available to perform.

The function returns a list containing the values of `result` starting from index 1 to the end.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of availability ranges for lecturers, and return a list of results starting from index 1 to the end.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of pairs representing lecturer availability, and returns a list of results starting from index 1 to the end.**
