The code `print(ans[i])` tries to print the value of `ans[i]`. However, since `ans` is undefined in the initial state, attempting to access `ans[i]` will raise a `NameError`. The code does not assign any value to `ans` or `i`, and `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify its value.

Output State: **`nnn` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is undefined**
