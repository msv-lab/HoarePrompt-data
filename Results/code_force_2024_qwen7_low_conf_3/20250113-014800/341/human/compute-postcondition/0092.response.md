`a[n]` is assigned the value `i` and `heapq.heappop(pq)` is called, which removes and returns the smallest element from the priority queue `pq`. Since `pq` initially does not contain any elements less than `i`, this operation might remove the smallest element from `pq`, but only if `pq` is not empty.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`pq` is a priority queue with its smallest element removed (if it was not empty), `a[n]` is the value of `i`, and `n` is incremented by 1.**
