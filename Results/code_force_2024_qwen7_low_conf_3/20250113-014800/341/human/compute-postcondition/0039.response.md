Postcondition: ***`start` is in the range [2, max_day - k + 1], with `start` updated to `start_prev + 1`. `count` is either 2 or 3. `current_window_sum` is 2 * (available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]). If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `count` is set to 2 or 3; otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
