The code updates `ans[i]` by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it. However, the initial values of `i` and `k` are not specified. We know from the initial state that `max(m, n)` must be greater than 0, `j` is initialized as \( m - (k + 1) \), and `ans[x - 1]` is updated by adding `ans[x]` to it. Since the specific values of `i` and `x` are not given, we cannot determine the exact numerical changes. But we can describe the impact on the variables involved.

Output State: **`max(m, n)` must be greater than 0, `j` is initialized as \( m - (k + 1) \), and `ans[i]` is updated by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it.**
