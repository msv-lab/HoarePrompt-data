`current_available` is incremented by the value of `availability[day]`. Since `day` is initially 1, `current_available` is added by `availability[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0, `current_available` is `availability[1]`, `available_days` is a list of length `max_day + 1` where each element is 0, and `day` is 2.**
