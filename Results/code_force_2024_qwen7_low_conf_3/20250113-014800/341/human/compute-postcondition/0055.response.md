Postcondition: **`current_window_sum` is its original value plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` and `k` remain unchanged, and `count` is increased by 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
