Output State: **`current_window_sum` is the sum of the last `k` elements starting from `available_days[start - 1]` where `start = start + k - 1`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k + 1`, and `count` is the number of times `current_window_sum` was greater than or equal to `k`.**
