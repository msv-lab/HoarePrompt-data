The code snippet `d[l] += 1` increments the value of `d[l]` by 1. According to the initial state, `l` is the first element of `a[i]`. Since no specific value for `l` is provided, `l` remains as the first element of `a[i]`. The value of `d[l]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value.

Output State: **`pq` must contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a[n]` is a valid tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop; `l` is the first element of `a[i]`; `r` is the second element of `a[i]`; `b[l]` is equal to `r`; `c[b[l]]` is incremented by 1; `d[l]` is incremented by 1.**
