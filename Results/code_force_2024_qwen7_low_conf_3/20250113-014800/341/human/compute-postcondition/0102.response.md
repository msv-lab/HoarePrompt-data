The code `l, r = a[i]` unpacks the tuple at index `i` of list `a` into variables `l` and `r`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a`, `i`, `l`, or `r`, we can only say that `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the tuple at index `i` of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`**
