The code initializes a new list `available_days` with a length of `max_day + 1`, where each element in the list is set to 0. This means that the list is filled with zeros up to the `max_day` index.

The initial state includes:
- `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\).
- `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0.
- `current_available` is 0.

After executing the code, the only change is the creation and initialization of the `available_days` list. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0; `current_available` is 0; `available_days` is a list of length `max_day + 1` where each element is 0.**
