Functionality: **The function processes a list of intervals `[l_i, r_i]` for each of `n` lecturers, where `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`. It then computes and prints the number of lecturers whose intervals do not overlap with a specific range of other lecturers' intervals. Specifically, for each position `i` from `1` to `nnn` (where `nnn` is the initial value of `n`), it prints the number of lecturers who have intervals that do not overlap with any interval ending before `i`.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the function’s behavior:
1. The function reads `n` from input and initializes several data structures to store and process the intervals.
2. It constructs a list `a` where `a[i]` stores the interval `[l_i, r_i]` for the `i-th` lecturer.
3. It builds a list `vc` where `vc[j]` contains all `r_i` for which `l_i = j`.
4. A priority queue `pq` is used to efficiently find the smallest `r_i` for each `l_i` in `vc[i]` that is greater than or equal to `i`.
5. It updates four auxiliary arrays `b`, `c`, `d`, and `ans` to keep track of the processed intervals and their counts.
6. It calculates the number of lecturers whose intervals do not overlap with any interval ending before each position `i`.
7. Finally, it prints the results for each position `i` from `1` to `nnn`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If `n` is `1`, the function processes only one lecturer and prints the result for that lecturer.
- If no intervals overlap with the criteria, `ans[i]` will be `0` for all positions `i`.
- If multiple intervals end at the same position, the function correctly identifies the smallest `r_i` that meets the criteria using the priority queue.**

This summary includes all the relevant actions performed by the function and covers all potential cases, including edge cases.
