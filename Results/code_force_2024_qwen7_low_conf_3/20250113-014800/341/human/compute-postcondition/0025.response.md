Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over `k` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - This means the loop will run exactly `n + 1` times, starting from `k = 1` and ending at `k = n + 1`.

2. **Identifying Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `lecturers`: A list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\).
   - `availability`: A list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0.
   - `current_available`: The sum of all `availability[i]` for `i` from 1 to `max_day`.
   - `available_days`: A list of length 200001 where each element is the cumulative sum of `availability[i]` from 1 to `i`.
   - `day`: `max_day + 1`.
   - `result`: A list of `n + 1` zeros.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement:**
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `day` must be within the range from 1 to `max_day + 1` because `k` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, and `k` should not exceed `max_day + 1`.

4. **Initial Values and Adjustments:**
   - `day` is initialized as `max_day + 1`. This means `day` is already set to its initial value, and it is valid for the loop to start since `k` will start from 1.
   - No other state variables directly affect the loop condition (i.e., `lecturers`, `availability`, `current_available`, `available_days`, or `result`).

### Conclusion

Since the loop will always execute as long as `day` is correctly initialized, no adjustments are necessary for these variables. However, we need to ensure that `day` is correctly set to `max_day + 1` for the loop to start properly.

### Final Answer

State: **`day` is `max_day + 1`**

This ensures that the loop can execute as expected.
