Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nnn` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is undefined.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `nnn + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be less than `nnn + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `nnn` is greater than 1.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `nnn` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - `ans` remains undefined as it was not modified within the loop body and no assignment to `ans` was mentioned.

Based on these observations, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`nnn` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is undefined**
