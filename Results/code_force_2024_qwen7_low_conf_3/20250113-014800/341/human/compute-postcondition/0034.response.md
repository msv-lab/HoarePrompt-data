`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `start`, `current_window_sum`, and `available_days` remain unchanged. The Output State is: `start` is in the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`, `count` is either 1 or 2 (depending on the initial value), `current_window_sum` is updated to `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]` and is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`start` is in the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`, `count` is either 1 or 2; `current_window_sum` is `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]` and is greater than or equal to `k`.**
