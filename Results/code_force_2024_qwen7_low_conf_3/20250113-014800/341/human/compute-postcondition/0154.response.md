To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop and the given state.

The `while` loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } j \geq i \text{ and } s < j - i + 1 \]

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- \( j_{\text{original}} - 1 \geq m \)
- \( s \) is either \( s - 1 \) if \( b[j] \) is `True`, or remains \( s \) if \( b[j] \) is `False`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
     - \( j \geq i \)
     - \( s < j - i + 1 \)

2. **First Condition (\( j \geq i \))**:
   - This condition must hold for the loop to continue. If \( j \) becomes less than \( i \), the loop stops.
   - We need to ensure that \( j \) is still greater than or equal to \( i \) for the next iteration.

3. **Second Condition (\( s < j - i + 1 \))**:
   - This condition must also hold for the loop to continue. If \( s \) is no longer less than \( j - i + 1 \), the loop stops.
   - We need to ensure that \( s \) is still less than \( j - i + 1 \) for the next iteration.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - From the first condition, we know \( j \geq i \). For the loop to execute again, \( j \) must remain greater than or equal to \( i \).
   - From the second condition, we need \( s < j - i + 1 \). For the loop to execute again, \( s \) must still be less than \( j - i + 1 \).

5. **Initial Value Consideration**:
   - The state \( j_{\text{original}} - 1 \geq m \) indicates that \( j \) was originally set to some value such that \( j_{\text{original}} - 1 \geq m \).
   - However, this does not directly impact the current state unless \( j \) is adjusted in the loop body.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that \( j \geq i \) and \( s < j - i + 1 \).

### Final Answer:
State: **\( j \geq i \) and \( s < j - i + 1 \)**
