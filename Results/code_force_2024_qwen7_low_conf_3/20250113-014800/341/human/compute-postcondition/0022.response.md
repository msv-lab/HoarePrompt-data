The code `available_days[day] = current_available` updates the `available_days` list at the index `day` with the value of `current_available`. From the initial state, we know:

- `current_available` is defined as `availability[1] + availability[3] + availability[day + 1]`.
- `day` is updated to `day + 2`.

Let's calculate the new values:

1. The original value of `day` was `day + 1`, and now it is updated to `day + 2`. So, the new value of `day` is `day + 2`.
2. `current_available` remains as `availability[1] + availability[3] + availability[day + 1]` because the code only updates the `available_days` list and does not modify the value of `current_available`.

Since `available_days[day]` is updated to `current_available`, and `day` is now `day + 2`, we get `available_days[day + 2] = availability[1] + availability[3] + availability[day + 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs (l_i, r_i), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0, `current_available` is `availability[1] + availability[3] + availability[day + 1]`, `available_days` is a list of length 200001 where each element is 0 except for `available_days[2]` which is `availability[1]`, `available_days[3]` is `availability[1] + availability[3]`, `day` is `day + 2`, `available_days[day + 2]` is `availability[1] + availability[3] + availability[day + 1]`.**
