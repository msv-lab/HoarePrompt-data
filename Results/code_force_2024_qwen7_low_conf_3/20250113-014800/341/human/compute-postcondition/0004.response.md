The code snippet decrements the value at index `r + 1` in the `availability` list by 1. Given the initial state where `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros, except for the elements from index `l_i` to `r_i` which are 1s, the value at index `r + 1` will be decremented from 0 to -1. However, since list indices cannot be negative, the actual effect is that this index remains 0 because decrementing 0 results in 0.

The `lecturers` list is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `availability` list and the unchanged `lecturers` list.

Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), and `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros where the element at each index `l_i` to `r_i` is 1, and the element at index `r + 1` is 0.**
