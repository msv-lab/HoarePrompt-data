To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. **Variable `day`:** The loop starts with `day` ranging from 1 to `max_day`. After the previous iteration, `day` was some value up to `max_day`. For the loop to execute again, `day` needs to be incremented by 1.

2. **List `lecturers`:** The state of the `lecturers` list does not change within the loop based on the information provided. It remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **List `availability`:** The state of the `availability` list does not change within the loop based on the information provided. It remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Variable `current_available`:** The value of `current_available` is derived from the `availability` list. Since the `availability` list does not change, `current_available` remains as `availability[1] + availability[3]`.

5. **List `available_days`:** The state of the `available_days` list does not change within the loop based on the information provided. It remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, let's step through the adjustments needed:

- The variable `day` was at the end of the previous iteration up to `max_day`. For the loop to execute again, `day` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `day + 1`.
- The `lecturers` list, `availability` list, `current_available`, and `available_days` lists remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0, `current_available` is `availability[1] + availability[3]`, `available_days` is a list of length 200001 where each element is 0 except for `available_days[2]` which is `availability[1]`, and `available_days[3]` is `availability[1] + availability[3]`, `day` is `day + 1`**.
