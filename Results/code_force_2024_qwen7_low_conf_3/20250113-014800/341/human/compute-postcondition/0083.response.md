Postcondition: ***`current_window_sum` is the old value of `current_window_sum` + (available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]), `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `current_window_sum` retains its value, `available_days` remains unchanged, and `start` and `count` remain the same as the precondition.***
