To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop and analyze the current state after the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while j >= i and s < j - i + 1:
```

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `pq` contains at least `m` elements.
- `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`.
- `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid.
- `l` and `r` are initialized based on the first tuple in `a`.
- `b[l]` is initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`.
- `c[r]` is initialized to 0.
- `d[l]` is initialized to 0.
- `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`.
- `s` is updated based on the condition `b[j]` (reduced by 1 if `b[j]` is non-zero, unchanged if `b[j]` is zero).
- `j` is `m - 2`.

Let's analyze the conditions for the loop to continue:

1. **Condition `j >= i`:**
   - `j` is `m - 2`.
   - `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be greater than or equal to `i`. Since `j = m - 2` and `i` is at least `m - 1`, this condition is already met. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `j >= i`.

2. **Condition `s < j - i + 1`:**
   - `s` is updated based on the condition `b[j]`.
   - `j - i + 1` evaluates to `m - 2 - i + 1 = m - i - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must be less than `m - i - 1`.

Since `i` is decreasing from `m` to `1`, the value of `j - i + 1` will decrease as `i` decreases. Therefore, the only condition that might need adjustment is ensuring that `s` remains less than `m - i - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `s` remains less than `m - i - 1`. Given the current state, `j` is `m - 2` and `i` is at least `m - 1`, so `s` must be appropriately set.

State: **`pq` contains at least `m` elements, `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid, `l` and `r` are initialized based on the first tuple in `a`, `b[l]` is initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`, `c[r]` is initialized to 0, `d[l]` is initialized to 0, `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`, `s` is updated based on the condition `b[j]` (reduced by 1 if `b[j]` is non-zero, unchanged if `b[j]` is zero), `j` is `m - 2`, and `s` must be less than `m - i - 1`**.
