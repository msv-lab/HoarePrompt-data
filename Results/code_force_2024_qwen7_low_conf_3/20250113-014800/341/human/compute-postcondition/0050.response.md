Postcondition: ***`start` is in the range `[2, max_day - (k_current + 1) + 1]`, `count` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`. `current_window_sum` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the `available_days` list, and `result[k_current + 1]` is updated to reflect the new value of `count`.***
