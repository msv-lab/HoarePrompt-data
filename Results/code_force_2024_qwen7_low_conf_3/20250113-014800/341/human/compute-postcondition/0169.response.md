State before the loop starts:
State: **`nnn` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**

### Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(1, nnn + 1):` will start iterating from `i = 1` up to `i = nnn`.
- For the loop to execute, `nnn` must be a positive integer greater than 0 because the `range` function generates numbers starting from the first argument (inclusive) up to but not including the second argument (exclusive).
- Initially, `i` is set to 1, which is the starting value of the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `nnn` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is set to 1.

State: **`nnn` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
