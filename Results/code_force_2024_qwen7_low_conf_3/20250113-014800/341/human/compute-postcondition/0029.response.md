`count` is incremented by 1. The values of `day`, `current_window_sum`, and `available_days` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `day` is `max_day + 1`, `count` is 1, `current_window_sum` is the sum of elements in `available_days` from index 1 to index `k + 1`.

Output State: **`day` is `max_day + 1`, `count` is 1, `current_window_sum` is the sum of elements in `available_days` from index 1 to index `k + 1`.**
