The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state is \( j \geq i \) and \( s \leq j - i \), the new value of `j` will be \( j - 1 \). The relationship \( s \leq j - i \) remains unchanged because the subtraction from `j` does not affect `s` or `i`.

Output State: **\( j \geq i \) and \( s \leq (j - 1) - i \)**
