Output State: **`pq` must contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`, `n` is the number of times the loop executed, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` represents the smallest element `j` from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop; `l` is the first element of `a[i]`; `r` is the second element of `a[i]`; for all `i` in the range `[1, n]`, `b[l]` is equal to `r` for the corresponding tuple; `c[r]` is the cumulative count of `r` across all iterations; `d[l]` is the cumulative count of `l` across all iterations; `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`.**
