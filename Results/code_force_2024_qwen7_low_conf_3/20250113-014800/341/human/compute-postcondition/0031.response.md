Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `day` is `max_day + 1`
- `count` is either 0 or 1
- `current_window_sum` is the sum of elements in `available_days` from index 1 to index `k + 1`. If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `start` values from `2` to `max_day - k + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `start`:**
   - The loop starts with `start = 2`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `start` must be within the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`.

2. **Variable `day`:**
   - Initially, `day` is set to `max_day + 1`.
   - The loop does not directly use `day`, but the value of `day` might affect the initial conditions of the loop.
   - Since `day` is not used in the loop itself and is initialized to `max_day + 1`, we don't need to adjust `day` explicitly for the loop to execute.

3. **Variable `count`:**
   - `count` is either 0 or 1.
   - The loop doesn't directly change the value of `count`, but it might be relevant if `count` affects the loop's continuation or exit condition.

4. **Variable `current_window_sum`:**
   - `current_window_sum` is the sum of elements in `available_days` from index 1 to index `k + 1`.
   - This sum is relevant to determine the value of `count` before the loop starts, but once the loop begins, `current_window_sum` is not directly updated by the loop.

5. **Variable `k`:**
   - `k` is part of the range calculation for the loop (`range(2, max_day - k + 2)`).
   - To ensure the loop starts, `k` must be a valid integer and `max_day - k + 1` should be non-negative.

### Conclusion:
- The loop starts with `start = 2`.
- `day` is not directly involved in the loop execution.
- `count` can be 0 or 1, and it might affect the loop's logic indirectly.
- `current_window_sum` is determined before the loop starts and is not directly updated by the loop.

Given these points, the critical adjustment needed for the loop to execute is related to the range of `start`.

### Final State:
- `start` must be in the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`.
- `count` can be either 0 or 1 (no specific adjustment needed since it is already defined).

Therefore, the final state before the loop is:

**State: **`start` is in the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`, `count` is either 0 or 1**.
