According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nnn`. If `i` is less than `nnn + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nnn` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3 and `nnn` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`nnn` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `ans` is undefined**
