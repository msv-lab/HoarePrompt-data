The code updates the `current_available` variable by adding `availability[day]` to its current value. The initial state is given as follows:
- `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\),
- `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0,
- `current_available` is `availability[1] + availability[3]`,
- `available_days` is a list of length 200001 where each element is 0 except for `available_days[2]` which is `availability[1]`, and `available_days[3]` is `availability[1] + availability[3]`,
- `day` is `day + 1`.

After executing the line `current_available += availability[day]`, the updated state will be:
- `current_available` is now `availability[1] + availability[3] + availability[day + 1]` (since `day` is incremented in the initial state).

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0, `current_available` is `availability[1] + availability[3] + availability[day + 1]`, `available_days` is a list of length 200001 where each element is 0 except for `available_days[2]` which is `availability[1]`, and `available_days[3]` is `availability[1] + availability[3]`, `day` is `day + 2`**
