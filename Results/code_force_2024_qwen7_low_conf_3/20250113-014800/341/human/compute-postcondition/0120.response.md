`j` is initialized to `m` and is decremented by 1. So, `j` becomes `m - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pq` contains at least `m` elements, `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid, `l` and `r` are initialized based on the first tuple in `a`, `b[l]` is initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`, `c[r]` is initialized to 0, `d[l]` is initialized to 0, `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`, `s` is `s - 1` if `b[m]` is truthy (non-zero) else `s`, `j` is now `m - 1`.
