To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the constraints step by step.

### Given Conditions:
- `j` is an integer and `j` is at least `i`.
- `s` is now `s - 1` if `b[j]` is `True` and `s` is the same as the initial value otherwise.
- `s` must be less than `j - i`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as:
- `j >= i` and
- `s < j - i + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Loop Condition Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must hold true:
     1. `j >= i`
     2. `s < j - i + 1`

2. **Adjusting `j`:**
   - The condition `j >= i` must be true. If `j` is already less than `i`, the loop cannot execute again.
   - Therefore, `j` must be at least `i` (which is already given).

3. **Adjusting `s`:**
   - The condition `s < j - i + 1` must be true. If `s` is already equal to or greater than `j - i + 1`, the loop cannot execute again.
   - Therefore, `s` must be less than `j - i + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- We need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the updated values of `j` and `s`.

Given the current state where `j` is at least `i` and `s` must be less than `j - i`, we need to ensure that `s` remains less than `j - i + 1` for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is an integer, `j` is at least `i`, `s` is now `s - 1` if `b[j]` is `True` and `s` is the same as the initial value otherwise, and `s` must be less than `j - i + 1`.**
