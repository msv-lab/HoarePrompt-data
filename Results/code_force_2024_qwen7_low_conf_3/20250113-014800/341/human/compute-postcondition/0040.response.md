Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs over the range from `2` to `max_day - k + 2`. This means the loop condition for the next iteration will depend on the value of `start`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `start` is in the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`.
   - `start` is updated to `start_prev + 1`.
   - `count` is either `2` or `3`.
   - `current_window_sum` is `2 * (available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1])`.
   - If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `count` is set to `2` or `3`; otherwise, there is no change to the variables.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `start` will be incremented by `1` (i.e., `start = start_prev + 1`).
   - Therefore, the new `start` value will be `start_prev + 1`.
   - Since `start` must still be within the valid range, the new `start` should now be in the range `[3, max_day - k + 2]` (considering the initial `start` was in `[2, max_day - k + 1]`).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `start` will now be `start_prev + 1`.
   - `count` remains unchanged unless `current_window_sum` is checked again, but since it didn't change in the previous iteration, it will remain `2` or `3`.
   - `current_window_sum` will depend on the new `start` value and the corresponding elements in `available_days`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`start` is in the range `[3, max_day - k + 2]`, `count` is either `2` or `3`, `current_window_sum` is `2 * (available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1])`**.
