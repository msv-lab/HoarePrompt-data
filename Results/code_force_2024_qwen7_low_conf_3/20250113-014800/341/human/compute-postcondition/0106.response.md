The code `d[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `d[r + 1]` by 1. The values of `a`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `b[l]`, `c[r]`, and `d[l]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
