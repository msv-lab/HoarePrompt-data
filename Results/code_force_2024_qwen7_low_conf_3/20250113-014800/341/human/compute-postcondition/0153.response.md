`j` is decremented by 1, changing its value from \( j_{\text{original}} \) to \( j_{\text{original}} - 1 \). The value of `s` is either `s - 1` if `b[j]` is `True`, or remains `s` if `b[j]` is `False`. The conditions for `s` remain unchanged because the code does not modify `s` directly, only updates `j`.

Output State: **\( j_{\text{original}} - 1 \geq m \); \( s \) is either `s - 1` if `b[j]` is `True`, or remains `s` if `b[j]` is `False`**
