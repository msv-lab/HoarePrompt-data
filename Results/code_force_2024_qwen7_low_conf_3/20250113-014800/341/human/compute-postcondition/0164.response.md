Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `max(m, n)` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is initialized as \( m - k \), where \( k \) is the number of iterations executed.
   - `ans[i]` is updated by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(max(m, n), 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `max(m, n)` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches 0.
   - This means the loop will execute `max(m, n)` times.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop starts from `max(m, n)` and decrements `i` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one less than its value at the end of the current iteration.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the current iteration, it will be `x - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `max(m, n)` remains unchanged unless `m` or `n` changes within the loop body, but since we are not given any such information, we assume it remains the same.
   - `j` is initialized based on the number of iterations executed, which is `k`. As the loop continues, `k` increases by 1 for each iteration.
   - `ans[i]` is updated by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it, so this update is dependent on the current value of `i`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `max(m, n)` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `j` is updated as the loop continues, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be \( m - (k + 1) \).
   - `ans[i]` is updated by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it, so at the start of the next iteration, `ans[i]` will be the result of the update from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `max(m, n)` remains the same.
- `j` will be \( m - (k + 1) \).
- `ans[i]` will be the updated value from the previous iteration, which is `ans[i + 1]` added to the previous `ans[i]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be \( x - 1 \).
- `j` will be \( m - (k + 1) \).

State: **`max(m, n)` must be greater than 0, `j` is initialized as \( m - (k + 1) \), and `ans[x - 1]` is updated by adding `ans[x]` to it.**
