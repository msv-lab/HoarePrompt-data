Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of pairs representing lecturer availability. It calculates and returns a list of integers, where the `k`-th element (starting from index 1) indicates the number of non-overlapping windows of length `k` that can be formed within the given lecturer availability periods. Each window must have at least one lecturer available.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Initializes a list `availability` to track the net number of lecturers available on each day.
2. Updates the `availability` list based on the provided lecturer availability periods.
3. Computes the cumulative sum of available lecturers up to each day, storing these sums in the `available_days` list.
4. For each value of `k` from 1 to `n`, calculates the number of valid windows of length `k` that can be formed, using the cumulative sums stored in `available_days`.
5. Returns a list containing the counts of valid windows for each `k` from 1 to `n`.

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where there are no overlapping availability periods by counting the number of non-overlapping windows.
- The function correctly handles the case where the total number of lecturers available is less than `k`, resulting in zero valid windows.
- The function ensures that only valid windows (where the sum of available lecturers is at least `k`) are counted.

The function does not handle the case where `n` is larger than the number of distinct days in the `availability` period, which would be an edge case but is implicitly handled by the loop conditions.
