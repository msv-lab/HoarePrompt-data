Postcondition: ***`j` is `j_original - k`, where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. `s` is `c[i] - count(True)`, where `count(True)` is the number of times `b[j]` was `True` during the loop, and the current value of `s` is consistent with this definition. `m` remains unchanged.***
