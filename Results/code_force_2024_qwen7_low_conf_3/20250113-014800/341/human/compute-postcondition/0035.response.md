Postcondition: ***`start` is in the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`, `count` is either 1 or 2, and `current_window_sum` is `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]`. If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `count` is incremented by 1. There is no change in `current_window_sum` in the else case.***
