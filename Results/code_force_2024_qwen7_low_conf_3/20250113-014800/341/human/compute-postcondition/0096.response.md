`l` and `r` are assigned the values of the tuple `a[i]`. Since `a[n]` is a valid tuple `(i, j)`, `a[i]` is also a tuple consisting of two elements, which we can denote as `l` and `r`. The values of `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of the tuple `a[i]`, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`pq` must contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `a[n]` must be a valid tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop; `l` is the first element of `a[i]`; `r` is the second element of `a[i]`.**
