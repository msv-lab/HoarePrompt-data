Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0, `current_available` is the sum of all `availability[i]` for `i` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days` is a list of length 200001 where each element is the cumulative sum of `availability[i]` from 1 to `i`, and `day` is `max_day + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `day = 1` to `day = max_day`.
- For each iteration, `current_available` accumulates the net number of lecturers available on the current day (`availability[day]`).
- `available_days[day]` is updated to store the cumulative sum of the net number of lecturers available up to and including the current day.
- After the loop completes, `day` will be `max_day + 1`, and `current_available` will be the sum of all `availability[i]` for `i` from 1 to `max_day`.
- Since the loop runs for every day from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days` will contain the cumulative sum of `availability[i]` for each day from 1 to `max_day`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `max_day` is 0):
- `lecturers` remains unchanged.
- `availability` remains unchanged.
- `current_available` remains 0.
- `available_days` is a list of 200001 zeros (since no days are processed).
- `day` is 1.
