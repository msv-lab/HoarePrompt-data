Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Understanding:**
   - `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\).
   - `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros.
   - For each pair \((l_i, r_i)\) in `lecturers`, the elements from index \(l_i\) to \(r_i\) (inclusive) in the `availability` list are set to 1, and the element at index \(r_i + 1\) is set to 0.

2. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each pair \((l, r)\) in `lecturers`.
   - During each iteration, the loop modifies the `availability` list by setting the values from index \(l\) to \(r\) to 1, and the value at index \(r + 1\) to 0.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's denote the pair processed in the previous iteration as \((l_{prev}, r_{prev})\).
   - After processing this pair, the elements in `availability` from index \(l_{prev}\) to \(r_{prev}\) are set to 1, and the element at index \(r_{prev} + 1\) is set to 0.

4. **Next Iteration Preparation:**
   - To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to know the next pair \((l_{next}, r_{next})\) in the `lecturers` list.
   - Since we don't know the exact order of the pairs in the `lecturers` list, we can only generalize based on the structure of the loop.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, the `availability` list will be modified by the next pair in the `lecturers` list.
   - Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next pair \((l_{next}, r_{next})\) and the corresponding changes to the `availability` list.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration can be summarized as follows:

- `lecturers` is still the same list, but now we are focusing on the next pair in the list.
- The `availability` list will be modified according to the next pair \((l_{next}, r_{next})\).

Since we do not have the specific values of the next pair, we can generalize the state as:

State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs, and `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros where the element at each index \(l_{next}\) to \(r_{next}\) is 1, and the element at index \(r_{next} + 1\) is 0.**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the next pair in the list is \((l_{next}, r_{next}) = (5, 10)\):

State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs, and `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros where the elements from index 5 to 10 are 1, and the element at index 11 is 0.**

This state reflects the general structure required for the next iteration of the loop.
