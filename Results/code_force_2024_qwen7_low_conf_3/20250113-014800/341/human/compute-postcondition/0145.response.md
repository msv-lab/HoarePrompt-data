Postcondition: **`j` is `j_original - k`, where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`; `s` is `c[i] - count(True)`, where `count(True)` is the number of times `b[j]` was `True` during the loop, and the current value of `s` is consistent with this definition; `m` remains unchanged; `ans` is updated such that the value at index `j - i + 1` is incremented by 1 if `j <= m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
