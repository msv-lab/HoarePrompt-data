`j` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is `m - 2`. After decrementing, `j` becomes `m - 3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pq` contains at least `m` elements, `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid, `l` and `r` are initialized based on the first tuple in `a`, `b[l]` is initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`, `c[r]` is initialized to 0, `d[l]` is initialized to 0, `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`, `s` is now `s - 1` and is still less than `m - i - 1`, `j` is `m - 3`.**
