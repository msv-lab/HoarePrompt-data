The code `availability[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value at index `r + 1` in the `availability` list by 1. Given the initial state, the elements from index 5 to 10 are 1, and the element at index 11 is 0. The value at index `l` in `availability` is now 2, but `l` is not used in the code snippet. The code only modifies the value at index `r + 1`.

Since the initial values of the elements from index 5 to 10 are 1, the value at index 6 (which is `r + 1` assuming `r` is 5) will be decremented by 1, making it 0. All other elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs, `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros where the elements from index 5 to 10 are 1, the element at index 11 is 0, and the element at index 6 is 0.**
