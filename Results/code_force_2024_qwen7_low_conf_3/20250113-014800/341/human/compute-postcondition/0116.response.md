To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the initial states of the variables involved and ensure they meet the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(m, 0, -1)`, which means `i` will take values from `m` down to `1`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least 1 when the loop starts, and `m` must be a positive integer (since negative values would not allow the loop to start).

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is the starting point of the loop, and it determines the number of iterations.
   - Since `i` will iterate from `m` down to `1`, `m` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `pq`: Must contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`. This means `pq` should have at least `m` elements.
   - `a`: Each tuple `(i, j)` in `a` represents the smallest element `j` from `vc[i]` that satisfies some conditions.
   - `l` and `r`: These are the first and second elements of the tuple `a[i]` respectively.
   - `b[l]`: For each tuple in `a`, `b[l]` is set to `r`.
   - `c[r]`: The cumulative count of `r` across all iterations.
   - `d[l]`: The cumulative count of `l` across all iterations.
   - `d[r + 1]`: Adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`.
   - `s`: Initialized to 0.
   - `j`: Assigned the value of `m`.

### Adjusted States for Loop Execution:

- `pq` must contain at least `m` elements.
- `m` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` must start from `m` and decrement down to `1`.
- `a` must be a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid.
- `l` and `r` must be initialized appropriately based on the first tuple in `a`.
- `b[l]` must be initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`.
- `c[r]` must be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.
- `d[l]` must be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.
- `d[r + 1]` must be adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`.
- `s` must be initialized to 0.
- `j` must be assigned the value of `m`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`pq` must contain at least `m` elements, `m` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` must start from `m` and decrement down to `1`, `a` must be a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid, `l` and `r` must be initialized based on the first tuple in `a`, `b[l]` must be initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`, `c[r]` must be initialized to 0, `d[l]` must be initialized to 0, `d[r + 1]` must be adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`, `s` must be initialized to 0, `j` must be assigned the value of `m`.**
