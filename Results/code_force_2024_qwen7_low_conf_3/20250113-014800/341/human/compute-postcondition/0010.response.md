The code `availability[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value at the index `r + 1` in the `availability` list by 1. Given the initial state, the elements from index 5 to 10 are 2, the element at index 11 is 1, and the element at index 6 is 1. However, the value of `r` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact index being modified. We can only state that the value at the index `r + 1` will be decremented by 1.

Since the initial values from index 5 to 10 are 2, if `r` is between 4 and 9 (inclusive), the value at the index `r + 1` will be decremented from 2 to 1. If `r` is 10, the value at index 11 will be decremented from 1 to 0. For any other value of `r`, the value at the index `r + 1` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs, `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros where the elements from index 5 to 10 are now 2, the element at index 11 is 1, the element at index 6 is 1, and the value at index `r + 1` is decremented by 1.**
