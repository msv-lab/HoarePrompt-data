Output State: **`start` is in the range `[2, max_day - k + 1]`, `count` is the total number of times `current_window_sum` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `current_window_sum` is the sum of the last `k` elements starting from `available_days[start - 1]`, and `result[k]` is equal to `count`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `n`. For each `k`, it calculates `count`, which represents the number of windows (of size `k`) where the sum of the availability is at least `k`.
- The inner loop adjusts `current_window_sum` by adding the new window and subtracting the old window, effectively sliding the window across the `available_days` list.
- After all iterations of the outer loop, `result[k]` contains the total count of such windows for each `k`.

Since the loop will always execute for each `k` from 1 to `n`, the final state will reflect the counts calculated for all possible window sizes. The variables `start`, `current_window_sum`, and `count` will be updated based on the loop logic, and `result[k]` will store the count for each `k`.
