`d[l]` is incremented by 1. Given that `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, the value of `d[l]` is updated. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1.**
