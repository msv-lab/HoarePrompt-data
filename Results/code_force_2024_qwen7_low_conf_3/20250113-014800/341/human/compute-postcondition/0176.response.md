The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Additionally, for each lecturer `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`), there are two parameters `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2·10^5.

However, since these additional parameters (`l_i` and `r_i`) are not included directly in the function signature but seem to be part of the problem's context, they are not explicitly mentioned in the function definition. The function does not return anything directly from the given information, so we infer that the return value is not specified here.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and for each lecturer `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n), there are associated integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2·10^5), but the specific operations or return value based on these parameters are not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. For each lecturer `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n), there are associated integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2·10^5), but no return value is specified.**
