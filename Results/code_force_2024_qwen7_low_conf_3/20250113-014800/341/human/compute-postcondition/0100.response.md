The code `d[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `d[r + 1]` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `a[n]` is a tuple `(i, j)`, where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop; `l` is the first element of `a[i]`; `r` is the second element of `a[i]`; `b[l]` is equal to `r`; `c[b[l]]` is incremented by 1; `d[l]` is incremented by 1. The value of `r` is known and `d[r + 1]` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`pq` must contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a[n]` is a valid tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop; `l` is the first element of `a[i]`; `r` is the second element of `a[i]`; `b[l]` is equal to `r`; `c[b[l]]` is incremented by 1; `d[l]` is incremented by 1; `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
