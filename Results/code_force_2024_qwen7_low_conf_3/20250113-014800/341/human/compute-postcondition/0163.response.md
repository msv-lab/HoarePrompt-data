The given code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans[i]`. We only know that `ans[i]` has been updated by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `ans`, `i`, and `n`, and there are no changes in `m`, `n`, or `j`, those variables retain their initial conditions. 

Output State: **`max(m, n)` must be greater than 0, `j` is initialized as \( m - k \) where \( k \) is the number of iterations executed, and `ans[i]` is updated by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it.**
