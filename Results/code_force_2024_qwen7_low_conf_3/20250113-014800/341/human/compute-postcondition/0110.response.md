`c[r]` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `c[r]` will increase by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a` that is `k + 1`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1 (the original value plus 1), `d[l]` is incremented by 1, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
