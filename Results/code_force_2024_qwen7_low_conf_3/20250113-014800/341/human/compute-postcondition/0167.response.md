The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it. However, the initial values of `ans`, `i`, and `j` are not specified. We know that `max(m, n)` must be greater than 0, `j` is \( m - (k + 1) \), and `i` is \( i - 1 \). Since `i` is updated by subtracting 1 from its original value, the new value of `i` will be one less than the original value. But since the exact values of these variables are not provided, we can only state that `i` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`max(m, n)` must be greater than 0; `j` is \( m - (k + 1) \); `i` is decreased by 1; `ans[i]` is updated to be `ans[i] + ans[i + 1]`.**
