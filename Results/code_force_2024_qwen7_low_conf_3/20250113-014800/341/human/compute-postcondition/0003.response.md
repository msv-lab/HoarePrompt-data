The code `availability[l] += 1` increments the value at index `l` in the `availability` list by 1. Given the initial state, the `availability` list is a list of 200002 zeros. After executing this line of code, the value at index `l` in the `availability` list will be incremented by 1, while all other elements in the `availability` list remain 0. The `lecturers` list is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), and `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros where the element at index `l` is 1, and all other elements are 0.**
