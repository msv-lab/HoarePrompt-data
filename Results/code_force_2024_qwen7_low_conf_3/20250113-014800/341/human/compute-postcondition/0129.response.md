The code snippet `ans[j - i + 1] += 1` impacts the list `ans` by incrementing the element at the index `j - i + 1` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `ans`, only that `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`. Since `ans` is not defined in the initial state and no default value is given, we cannot determine the exact state of `ans` after the operation. The only change is to the element at the index `j - i + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `j` is less than or equal to `m`; the element `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`j` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `j` is less than or equal to `m`; the element `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1.**
