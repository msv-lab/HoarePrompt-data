Output State: **`nnn` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is the last iteration value (which is `nnn`), `ans` is undefined**.

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = nnn`. For the loop to execute at least once, `nnn` must be greater than 0.
- After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be equal to `nnn` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `nnn`.
- The variable `ans` is never defined or modified within the loop, so it remains undefined regardless of the number of iterations.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is that `nnn` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` will be equal to `nnn`, and `ans` will remain undefined.
