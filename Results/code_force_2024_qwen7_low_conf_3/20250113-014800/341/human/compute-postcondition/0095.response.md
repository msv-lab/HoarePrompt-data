Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

2. **Determine Required States**:
   - **`pq`**: Since the loop involves an index `i` ranging from `1` to `n`, we need to ensure that `pq` contains elements that are relevant for the loop iterations. Specifically, `pq` should contain enough elements such that when `i` starts at `1` and increments up to `n`, there are valid elements in `pq` for each `i`.
   - **`n`**: As given, `n` is the upper limit of the loop and must be greater than or equal to `1` for the loop to execute.
   - **`a`**: The array `a` is defined such that `a[n]` contains a tuple `(i, j)`. For the loop to execute correctly, `a` should be initialized properly, and `a[n]` should be a valid tuple where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop.

Given these points, let's formulate the required states:

- `pq` must contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`.
- `n` must be at least `1` to ensure the loop can execute.
- `a[n]` must be a valid tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop.

State: **`pq` must contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `a[n]` must be a valid tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop.**
