Postcondition: ***`pq` is a priority queue that may or may not be empty, but does not contain any elements less than `i`. `n` is the total number of times the loop executed. For each `i` such that `a[n] = i`, `pq` did not contain an element less than `i` at the point when `i` was processed. `a[n]` is the last value of `i` that caused the loop to execute at least once, and `n` is incremented accordingly. The condition `(pq)` evaluates to true.***
