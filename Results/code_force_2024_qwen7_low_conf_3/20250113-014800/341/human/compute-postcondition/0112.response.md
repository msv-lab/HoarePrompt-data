The code `d[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `d[r + 1]` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `i` is an index within the list `a` that is `k + 1`.
- `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`.
- `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`.
- `b[l]` is equal to `r`.
- `c[r]` is increased by 1.
- `d[l]` is incremented by 1.
- `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.

The only variable that changes its value is `d[r + 1]`. Therefore, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a` that is `k + 1`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1, `d[r + 1]` is `d[r + 1] - 1`**
