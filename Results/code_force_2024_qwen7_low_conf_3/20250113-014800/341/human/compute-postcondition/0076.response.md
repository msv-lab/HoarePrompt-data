Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - The current window sum (`current_window_sum`) is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]`, plus `available_days[max_day]`, minus `available_days[max_day - k]`.
   - `available_days` remains unchanged.
   - `start` is `max_day - k`.
   - `count` is increased by 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the same conditions hold as the precondition.

2. **Understand the loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `start` from `2` to `max_day - k + 2`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `start = max_day - k`.
   - After the first iteration, `start` is incremented by 1, so `start` becomes `max_day - k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since `start` is incremented, the new value of `start` is `max_day - k + 1`.
   - The conditions for `current_window_sum`, `available_days`, and `count` remain the same as they did not change within the loop itself but depend on the value of `start`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the updated value of `start`.

**State: **`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]` plus `available_days[max_day]` minus `available_days[max_day - k]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k + 1`, and `count` is increased by 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the same conditions hold as the precondition.**
