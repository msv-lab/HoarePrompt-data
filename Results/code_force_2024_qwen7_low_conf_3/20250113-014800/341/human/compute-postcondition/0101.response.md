Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `pq` must contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a[n]` is a valid tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop.
   - `l` is the first element of `a[i]`.
   - `r` is the second element of `a[i]`.
   - `b[l]` is equal to `r`.
   - `c[b[l]]` is incremented by 1.
   - `d[l]` is incremented by 1.
   - `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.

2. **Loop Iteration Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - Each iteration modifies several variables based on the tuple `a[i]`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - After each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the range `[1, n]`.
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increases by 1 with each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and considering the loop condition `i in range(1, n + 1)`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` itself.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same since it doesn't change within the loop.

Since `i` was the last modified variable inside the loop and it controls the loop's continuation, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1` for the next iteration.

**Final State**:
- `pq` must still contain sufficient elements to cover the range of `i` from `1` to `n`.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a[n]` remains a valid tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is in the range `[1, n]` and `j` is the smallest element from `vc[i]` that satisfies the conditions within the loop.
- `l` is the first element of `a[i + 1]`.
- `r` is the second element of `a[i + 1]`.
- `b[l]` will be equal to `r` in the next iteration.
- `c[b[l]]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
- `d[l]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
- `d[r + 1]` will be decreased by 1 in the next iteration.
