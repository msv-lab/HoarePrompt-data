To determine the necessary states to adjust for the given for loop to execute, let's break down the information provided and analyze the conditions under which the loop will run.

### Given Information:
- **State before the loop starts:**
  - \( j \) is \( m - k \), where \( k \) is the number of iterations the loop executed.
  - \( s \) is the cumulative count of False values in \( b \) up to the final value of \( j \).
  - \( \text{ans}[j - i + 1] \) is incremented by 1 for each valid iteration.
  - \( m \) remains unchanged.

- **For Loop:**
  ```
  for i in range(max(m, n), 0, -1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for the For Loop to Execute:**
   - The for loop runs over the range from `max(m, n)` down to 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Adjusting States:**
   - The variable \( m \) remains unchanged.
   - The initial value of \( j \) is \( m - k \). However, since \( k \) is the number of iterations executed, we don't know the exact initial value of \( j \) without knowing \( k \). But we know that \( j \) should be initialized such that the loop can start executing.
   - The loop will run as long as \( i \) (which starts from `max(m, n)` and decrements by 1 each time) is greater than or equal to 1.

### Conclusion:
- Since the loop starts from `max(m, n)` and decrements until it reaches 1, we need to ensure that `max(m, n)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at all.
- The values of \( s \) and \( \text{ans} \) will be updated within the loop, but they don't affect the starting condition of the loop itself.

### Final State:
State: **`m` remains unchanged, `n` is a known value, `j` is initialized as \( m - k \) where \( k \) is the number of iterations executed, `i` starts from `max(m, n)` and decreases, and the loop will execute as long as `max(m, n)` is at least 1.**

However, to ensure clarity and completeness in the answer, we should focus on the essential states needed for the loop to start:

**State: **`max(m, n)` must be greater than 0, and `j` is initialized as \( m - k \) where \( k \) is the number of iterations executed.**
