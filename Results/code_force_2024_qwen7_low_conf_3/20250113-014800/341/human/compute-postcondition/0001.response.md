The code initializes a list `availability` with zeros, where the length of the list is `max_day + 2`. Given the initial state, the `n` and `lecturers` variables remain unchanged, but now there is a new list `availability` initialized to `[0] * (max_day + 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `lecturers` is a list of pairs (l_i, r_i), where each pair represents the range of days [l_i, r_i] (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2·10^5) that the i-th lecturer is available to perform, `max_day` is 200000, `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros**
