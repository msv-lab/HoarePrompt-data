`count` is incremented by 1. The values of `current_window_sum`, `available_days`, `start`, and `k` remain unchanged. The precondition that the current value of `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k` is also preserved.

Output State: **`current_window_sum` is its original value plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` and `k` remain unchanged, `count` is increased by 1, and the current value of `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
