Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `max(m, n)` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is initialized as \( m - (k + 1) \).
   - `ans[i]` is updated by adding `ans[i + 1]` to it.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(max(m, n), 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `max(m, n)` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value between `max(m, n)` and 1 (inclusive).

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.
   - Thus, the new value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - Since `i` was in the range `[max(m, n), 1]`, the new `i` will now be in the range `[max(m, n) - 1, 0]`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `max(m, n)` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.
   - `j` and `ans[i]` are updated within the loop, but their values are not specified here, so we assume they remain as they were before the loop.

6. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `max(m, n)` must still be greater than 0.
   - `j` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `ans[i]` will be updated in the current iteration, but its exact value is not specified, so we keep it as it was.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `max(m, n)` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is unchanged.
- `i` is decreased by 1.

**State: **`max(m, n)` must be greater than 0, `j` is \( m - (k + 1) \), `i` is \( i - 1 \)**.
