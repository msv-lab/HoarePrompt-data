`count` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `current_window_sum` and other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]` plus `available_days[max_day]` minus `available_days[max_day - k]`, and `start` is `max_day - k` (with `max_day - k` being at least 2) is preserved.

Output State: **`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]` plus `available_days[max_day]` minus `available_days[max_day - k]`; `available_days` remains unchanged; `start` is `max_day - k`; `count` is increased by 1.**
