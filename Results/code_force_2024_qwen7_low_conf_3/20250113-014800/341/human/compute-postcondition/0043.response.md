Postcondition: ***`start` is in the range `[3, max_day - k + 2]`, `count` is either `3` or `4`, and `current_window_sum` is `3 * (available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1])`. If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `count` becomes `4`. Otherwise, `count` remains `3`.***
