`b[l]` is assigned the value `r`. Given that `b[l]` was previously equal to `r`, this assignment does not change the values of the variables. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a` that is `k + 1`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
