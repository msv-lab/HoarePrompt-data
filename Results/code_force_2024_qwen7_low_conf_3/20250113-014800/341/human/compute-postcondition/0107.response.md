Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a` is a list.
   - `i` is an index within the list `a`.
   - `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`.
   - `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`.
   - `b[l]` is equal to `r`.
   - `c[r]` is increased by 1.
   - `d[l]` is incremented by 1.
   - `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current value of `i` (let's say it was `k`).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `k + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` increases by 1, the new index `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `k + 1` is still within the valid range for the loop, which means `k + 1` should be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - The tuple at index `i` of `a` will now be `a[k + 1]`.
   - Let `l` be the first element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`.
   - Let `r` be the second element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `b[l]` is still equal to `r`.
   - `c[r]` will be increased by 1.
   - `d[l]` will be incremented by 1.
   - `d[r + 1]` will be decreased by 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` becomes `k + 1`.
- `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`.
- `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`.

State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a` that is `k + 1`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.**

In summary:
State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a` that is `k + 1`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `k + 1` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
