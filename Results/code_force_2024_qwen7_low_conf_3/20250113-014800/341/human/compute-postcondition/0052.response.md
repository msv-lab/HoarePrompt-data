The code `current_window_sum += available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]` updates the value of `current_window_sum` by adding the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]` to `current_window_sum`. However, the initial values of `current_window_sum`, `available_days`, `start`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state. 

To proceed, let's assume the following (since exact values are not provided, we'll keep them general):
- `current_window_sum` is a variable holding some initial sum.
- `available_days` is a list of integers.
- `start` and `k` are indices or integers related to the list `available_days`.

Given this, the updated value of `current_window_sum` would be the original value of `current_window_sum` plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`.

Output State: **`current_window_sum` is its original value plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` and `k` remain unchanged.**
