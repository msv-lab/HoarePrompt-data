Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `day` in the range from 1 to `max_day + 1`.
   - Key variables involved are `day`, `lecturers`, `availability`, `current_available`, and `available_days`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Required for the Loop:**
   - The loop will start executing if `day` is within the specified range. Since `day` starts at 1 and goes up to `max_day + 1`, the initial value of `day` should be 1.
   - `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\) and is given as is.
   - `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0. This list is also given as is.
   - `current_available` is the number of lecturers available on the current day. Initially, this should be set to the value of `availability[day]` (which is `availability[1]` since the loop starts with `day = 1`).
   - `available_days` is a list of length `max_day + 1` where each element is 0. This list will be updated during the loop execution but needs to be initialized as given.

3. **State Before the Loop Starts:**
   - `lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\).
   - `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0.
   - `current_available` is 0.
   - `available_days` is a list of length `max_day + 1` where each element is 0.
   - `day` should be initialized to 1 to start the loop.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to:

State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0, `current_available` is 0, `available_days` is a list of length `max_day + 1` where each element is 0, and `day` is 1.**
