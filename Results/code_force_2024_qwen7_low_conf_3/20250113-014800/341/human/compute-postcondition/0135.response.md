The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The value of `m` and `s` remain unchanged, and the condition for `s` still holds true. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is an integer and has been decreased by 1, `m` is an integer, `s` is `s - 1` if `b[j]` is `True` and `s` is the same as the initial value otherwise, and `s` is still less than `j - i + 1`.

Output State: **`j` is an integer and has been decreased by 1, `m` is an integer, `s` is `s - 1` if `b[j]` is `True` and `s` is the same as the initial value otherwise, and `s` is still less than `j - i + 1`.**
