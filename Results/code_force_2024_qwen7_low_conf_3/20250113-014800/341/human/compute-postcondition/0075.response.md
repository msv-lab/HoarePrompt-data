Postcondition: ***`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]` plus `available_days[max_day]` minus `available_days[max_day - k]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k`, and `count` is increased by 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the same conditions hold as the precondition.***
