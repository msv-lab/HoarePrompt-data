Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]` plus `available_days[max_day]` minus `available_days[max_day - k]` plus `available_days[max_day]` minus `available_days[max_day - k]`.
   - `available_days` remains unchanged.
   - `start` is `max_day - k + 1`.
   - `count` is increased by 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `current_window_sum` is less than `k`, `count` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for start in range(2, max_day - k + 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts from `start = 2` and goes up to `start = max_day - k + 1` (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, `start` increases by 1.

4. **Current State:**
   - `start` is currently `max_day - k + 1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `start` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `max_day - k + 2`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is dependent on `start`, we only need to adjust `start` to reflect the next value it should take.
   - All other states (`current_window_sum`, `available_days`, `count`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are specified.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]` plus `available_days[max_day]` minus `available_days[max_day - k]` plus `available_days[max_day]` minus `available_days[max_day - k]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k + 2`, and `count` remains unchanged.**
