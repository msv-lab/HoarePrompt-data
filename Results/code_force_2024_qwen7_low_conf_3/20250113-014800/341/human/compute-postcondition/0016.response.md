The code assigns the value of `current_available` to `available_days[day]`. Given that `current_available` is `availability[1]`, and `day` is 2, this assignment updates `available_days[2]` to `availability[1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`lecturers` is a list of pairs \((l_i, r_i)\), `availability` is a list of 200002 integers where each element from index 1 to 200000 reflects the net number of lecturers available on that day, and the elements at indices 200001 and 200002 are 0, `current_available` is `availability[1]`, `available_days` is a list of length 200001 where each element is 0 except for `available_days[2]` which is `availability[1]`, and `day` is 2.**
