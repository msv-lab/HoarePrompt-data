To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } j \ge i \text{ and } s < j - i + 1 \]

Given the current state:
- `pq` contains at least `m` elements.
- `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`.
- `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid.
- `l` and `r` are initialized based on the first tuple in `a`.
- `b[l]` is initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`.
- `c[r]` is initialized to 0.
- `d[l]` is initialized to 0.
- `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`.
- `s` is `s - 1` if `b[m]` is truthy (non-zero) else `s`.
- `j` is `m - 1`

For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
1. \( j \ge i \)
2. \( s < j - i + 1 \)

Let's consider the current values:
- The initial value of `i` is `m`.
- The initial value of `j` is `m - 1`.

If `i` has decremented from `m` to some value `k`, then `i = k`. Given that `i` is decrementing, the smallest possible value of `i` would be `1`.

To satisfy \( j \ge i \):
- Since `j` is set to `m - 1`, the smallest possible value of `i` should be such that `m - 1 \ge i`. This means `i` should be at least `1`.

To satisfy \( s < j - i + 1 \):
- With `j = m - 1`, the condition becomes \( s < (m - 1) - i + 1 \), which simplifies to \( s < m - i \).

Since `i` has started from `m` and decreased, the maximum value of `i` is `1`, and the minimum value of `s` would be `m - 1` if no decrement occurred.

To ensure the loop can continue:
- `i` must be at least `1`.
- `s` must be less than \( m - i \).

Considering these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is at least `1` and `s` is less than \( m - 1 \).

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `i` is at least `1`.
- Ensure `s` is less than `m - 1`.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `pq` contains at least `m` elements, `i` must be at least `1`, `s` must be less than `m - 1`**
