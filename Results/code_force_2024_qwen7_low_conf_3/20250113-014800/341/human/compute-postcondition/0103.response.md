The code `b[l] = r` assigns the value of `r` to the index `l` in the list `b`. The variables `a`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. The variable `r` is also unchanged since it is only being used to assign a value.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`**
