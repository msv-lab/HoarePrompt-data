`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is either 2 or 3, so after incrementing, `count` will be either 3 or 4. The values of `start` and `current_window_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is in the range `[3, max_day - k + 2]`, `count` is either 3 or 4, `current_window_sum` is `3 * (available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1])`**
