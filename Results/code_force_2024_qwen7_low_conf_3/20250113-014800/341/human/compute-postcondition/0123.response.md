The code `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` was set to `m - 1`. After decrementing, the new value of `j` is `m - 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the updated state includes `j` being decremented to `m - 2`.

Output State: **`pq` contains at least `m` elements, `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid, `l` and `r` are initialized based on the first tuple in `a`, `b[l]` is initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`, `c[r]` is initialized to 0, `d[l]` is initialized to 0, `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`, `s` is updated based on the condition `b[j]` (reduced by 1 if `b[j]` is non-zero, unchanged if `b[j]` is zero), `j` is `m - 2`**
