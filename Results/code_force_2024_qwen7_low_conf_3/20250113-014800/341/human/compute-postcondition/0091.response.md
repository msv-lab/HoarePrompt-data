The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Since `n` was the total number of times the loop executed before this line, incrementing it means that one more iteration of the loop has been counted. The conditions and states of the other variables and the priority queue (`pq`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pq` is a priority queue that may or may not be empty, but does not contain any elements less than `i`. `n` is the total number of times the loop executed plus 1. For each `i` such that `a[n-1] = i`, `pq` did not contain an element less than `i` at the point when `i` was processed. `a[n-1]` is the last value of `i` that caused the loop to execute at least once, and `n` is incremented accordingly. The condition `(pq)` evaluates to true.**
