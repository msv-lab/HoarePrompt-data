To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the conditions given by the `while` loop statement:

1. The condition `j >= i` must be true.
2. The condition `s < j - i + 1` must be true.

Let's break down the initial state:

- `pq` contains at least `m` elements.
- `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`.
- `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid.
- `l` and `r` are initialized based on the first tuple in `a`.
- `b[l]` is initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`.
- `c[r]` is initialized to 0.
- `d[l]` is initialized to 0.
- `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`.
- `s` is incremented by `c[i]`.
- `j` is assigned the value of `m`.

For the loop to execute at least once:

1. `j` must be initialized to `m` and must be greater than or equal to `i`.
2. `s` must be less than `j - i + 1`.

Given the initial state, `j` is already set to `m`, and since `i` starts from `m` and decrements, `j >= i` will always be true initially. However, `s` must be less than `j - i + 1` for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is `s` must be less than `j - i + 1`.

State: **`pq` contains at least `m` elements, `i` starts from `m` and decrements down to `1`, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, j)` is valid, `l` and `r` are initialized based on the first tuple in `a`, `b[l]` is initialized to `r` based on the first tuple in `a`, `c[r]` is initialized to 0, `d[l]` is initialized to 0, `d[r + 1]` is adjusted by `-1` for each iteration corresponding to `r`, `s` must be less than `j - i + 1`, `j` is initialized to `m`**
