The code `c[r] += 1` increments the value of `c[r]` by 1. Based on the initial state, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`. Since `b[l]` is equal to `r`, the value of `c[r]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `l` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `r` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `b[l]` is equal to `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1**
