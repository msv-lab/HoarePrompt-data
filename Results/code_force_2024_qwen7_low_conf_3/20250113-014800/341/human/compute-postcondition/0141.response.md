`j` is decremented by 1, which means `j` is now `j - 1`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `j` is an integer and at least `i`, `s` is now `s - 1` if `b[j]` is `True` and `s` is the same as the initial value otherwise, and `s` must be less than `j - i + 1`.

Output State: **`j` is `j - 1`, `s` is now `s - 1` if `b[j]` is `True` and `s` is the same as the initial value otherwise, and `s` must be less than `j - i + 1`.**
