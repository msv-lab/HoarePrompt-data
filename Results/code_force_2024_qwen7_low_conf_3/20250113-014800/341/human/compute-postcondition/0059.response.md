Postcondition: ***`current_window_sum` is its original value plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` is `start + 1`, and `count` is `count + 1` if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
