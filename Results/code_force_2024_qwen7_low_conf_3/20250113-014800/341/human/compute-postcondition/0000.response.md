The code assigns the value 200000 to the variable `max_day`. This does not affect the values of `n` or the list `lecturers`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `lecturers` is a list of pairs (l_i, r_i), where each pair represents the range of days [l_i, r_i] (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2·10^5) that the i-th lecturer is available to perform, `max_day` is 200000**.
