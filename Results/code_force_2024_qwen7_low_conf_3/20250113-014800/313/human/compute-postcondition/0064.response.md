`a[j]` is decremented by `m`. From the initial state, we know `a[j]` is unchanged, and from the definition of `m`, `m` is the minimum of `a[0] - m`, `a[n-1]`, and `k // 2`. After executing `a[j] -= m`, the value of `a[j]` becomes `a[j] - m`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `i` is 1 if `a[0] - m < 1`, otherwise `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`; `a[i]` is `a[0] - m`; `a[j]` is `a[j] - m`; `m` is the minimum of `a[0] - m`, `a[n-1]`, and `k // 2`; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is the value of `initial k - 2 * m * (number of iterations + 1)`**
