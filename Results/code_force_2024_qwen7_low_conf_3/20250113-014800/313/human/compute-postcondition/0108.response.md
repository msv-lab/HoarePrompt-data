The code sets `lastState` to `-1`. Since this is the only assignment in the snippet, no other variables are affected. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque([1, 2, 3]), `sunk` is 0, `lastState` is -1**
