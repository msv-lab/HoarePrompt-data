Output State: **`t` is `R() - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input and must be at least 2, `k` is reduced to the final non-negative remainder after all possible iterations of the loop, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a[i]` is decreased by `m` such that `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2` for the respective `i` and `j`, `i` is `n` if the condition `i < j` is no longer satisfied, otherwise `i` is the smallest index satisfying `i < j` and `a[i] >= 1`, `j` is `-1` if the condition `i < j` is no longer satisfied, otherwise `j` is the largest index satisfying `i < j` and `a[j] >= 1`.**
