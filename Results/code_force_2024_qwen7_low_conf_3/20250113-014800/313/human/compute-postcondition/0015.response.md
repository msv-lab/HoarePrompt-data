`k` is decreased by twice the value of `m`. The exact values of `k` and `m` are not specified in the initial state, but we know that `k` is reduced by `2 * m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is reduced by `2 * m`; `m` retains its original value.

Output State: **`k` is reduced by `2 * m`; `m` retains its original value.**
