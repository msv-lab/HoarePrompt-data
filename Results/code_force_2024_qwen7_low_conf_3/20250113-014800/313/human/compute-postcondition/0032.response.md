The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. The value of `t` is updated to `t - 1` from the initial state. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the values returned by `R()`. The state of `i` is now 0, while `t` is `t - 1`, and `n` and `k` retain their values from `R()`. 

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `R()`, `i` is 0**
