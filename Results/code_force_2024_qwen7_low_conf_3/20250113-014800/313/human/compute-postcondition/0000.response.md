The provided lambda function `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())` reads input from the standard input and splits it into multiple integers, converting them to integers. It does not assign these values to any variables in the current scope; instead, it returns an iterator object that can be used to get the integers. The initial state of `t` being a positive integer and the list `a` with its elements unchanged is preserved.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the lambda function `R` is now defined but no variables have been updated with specific values from the input yet.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a list of n integers a where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the lambda function R is defined to read input and split it into integers.**
