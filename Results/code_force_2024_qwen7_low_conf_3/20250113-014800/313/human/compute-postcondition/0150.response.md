`lit` is a deque that was initially empty. The code `lit.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the deque. Since the deque was empty, popping from an empty deque will remove `None` and reduce the size of the deque by 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 2*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque with length 0, `sunk` is 3, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement.**
