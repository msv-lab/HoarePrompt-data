`u` is assigned the value of the element in the list `lit` at the index `lastState`. If `lastState` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the code does not execute. Otherwise, `lastState` is 0, so `u` is assigned the value of `lit[0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `lit` is a list
- `k` is an integer
- If `lastState` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since `lastState` is 0 (as per the initial state), the code executes, and `u` is assigned the value of `lit[0]`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lit` is a list, `k` is an integer, `u` is equal to `lit[0]`**
