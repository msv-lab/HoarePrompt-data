`t` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `t` was the first integer read from input using `R()`, so the new value of `t` is this initial value minus 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from input using `R()` minus 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
