`n` and `k` are assigned the values of `R()`, which reads two integers from input. The value of `t` is `R()` minus 1, and the value of `n` was previously a positive integer. The value of `k` was an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and the value of `a` was a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. After executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from input, and the state of `a` is not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `R() - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
