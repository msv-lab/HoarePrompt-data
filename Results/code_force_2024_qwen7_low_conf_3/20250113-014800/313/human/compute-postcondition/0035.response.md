`k` is assigned the value of `k - (m * 2)`. The initial state shows that `k` and `n` are the values returned by `R()`, and `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and `n` must be at least 2. Since the exact values of `k` and `m` are not provided, we can only express `k` in terms of its initial value and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `2 * m`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `R()`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1` and `n` must be at least 2**
