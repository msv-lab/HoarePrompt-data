The `pop` method removes the last element from the list `lit`. The value of `u` is equal to `lit[0]`, which means `u` was the first element in the list before the `pop` operation. After `pop`, the length of `lit` decreases by one, and `u` remains unchanged because it holds the value of the first element before the `pop` operation. 

Output State: **`lit` is a list with one less element, `k` is an integer, `u` is equal to `lit[0]`, `sunk` is incremented by 1**
