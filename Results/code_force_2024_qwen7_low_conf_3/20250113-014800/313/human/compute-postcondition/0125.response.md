The code `lit.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `lit`. Given the initial state, `lit` is a deque containing `[lit[0]]`, and `u` is equal to `lit[0]`. Since `u` is greater than `k`, the leftmost element (which is `u`) is removed from the deque. 

After executing the code, `lit` becomes an empty deque because it only had one element initially. The value of `u` is no longer defined since it was dependent on `lit[0]`, which is now removed.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 1, and `u` is undefined.**
