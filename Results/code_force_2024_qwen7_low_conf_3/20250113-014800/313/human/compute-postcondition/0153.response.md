Postcondition: ***`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 2*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque with or without its leftmost element, `sunk` is 3, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement. If `u <= k`, then `lit` has its leftmost element removed or remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, taking into account the condition `u <= k` and the specified postconditions for both the if and else parts.
