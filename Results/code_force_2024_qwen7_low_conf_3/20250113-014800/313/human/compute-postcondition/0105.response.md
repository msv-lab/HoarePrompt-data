Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop is controlled by `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (let's denote it as `t_val`).
   - `n` is an integer read from input.
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.
   - `lit` is empty.
   - `sunk` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `lastState` is -1.

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t_val` must be decremented by 1 because the loop is controlled by `t`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `a`, `lit`, `sunk`, `k`, `lastState`) remain unchanged.

Given this reasoning, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `t` is `t_val - 1` (where `t_val` is the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is empty, `sunk` is 0, `k` is 0, `lastState` is -1**
