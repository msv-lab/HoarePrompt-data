The line `lastState = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `lastState`. This does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u` (where `u` is `lit[0]`), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 1, `u` is undefined, `lastState` is 0.**
