`sunk` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `sunk` is 1, so after the increment, `sunk` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u` (where `u` is `lit[0]`), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is undefined.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u` (where `u` is `lit[0]`), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is undefined.**
