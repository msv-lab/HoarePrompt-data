`a[i]` is decremented by `m`. The value of `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`. Since `a[i]` is updated, its new value is `a[i] - m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - m`, `a[j]` is unchanged, `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value of `initial k - 2 * m * (number of iterations + 1)`**
