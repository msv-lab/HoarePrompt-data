The code assigns the value of `lit[lastState]` to the variable `u`. Given the initial state, the value of `lastState` is either -1 or 0, but since the last state changes to 0 if it was -1, and remains -1 otherwise, `lastState` is now 0. Therefore, `u` is assigned the value of `lit[0]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque([`lit[0]`]), `sunk` is 0, and `u` is `lit[0]`.**
