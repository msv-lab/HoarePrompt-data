The code assigns the value of the element in the list `lit` at the index specified by `lastState` to the variable `u`. Since the initial state of `lastState` is either -1 or 0, `u` will take the value of `lit[-1]` or `lit[0]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lit` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `u` is equal to `lit[-1]` if `lastState` is -1, or `lit[0]` if `lastState` is 0.**
