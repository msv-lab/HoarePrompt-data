The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code, and there are no variables that are explicitly updated within this statement, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u` (where `u` is `lit[0]`), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 1, and `u` is undefined.**
