The code `a[i] -= m` decreases the element at index `i` in list `a` by the value of `m`. This operation affects the value of `a[i]` but does not change the values of `k`, `m`, `j`, or any other variables. The precondition that `j` must be greater than or equal to `i` remains valid.

Output State: **`k` is reduced by `3 * m`, the element at index `i` in list `a` is decreased by `m`, the element at index `j` in list `a` is decreased by `m`, and `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`**
