`sunk` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `sunk` is 2, so after incrementing, the value of `sunk` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 2*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 3, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 2*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 3, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement.**
