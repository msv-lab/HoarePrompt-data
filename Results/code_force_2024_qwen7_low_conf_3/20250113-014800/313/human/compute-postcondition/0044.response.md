`a[j]` is assigned the value of itself minus `m`. From the initial state, we know that `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is the value returned by `R()`, and `k` is the value returned by `R()`. Also, `a[i]` is `a[i] - m`, and `i` is 2 if `a[0] < 1` otherwise `i` is 0. After the code `a[j] -= m` executes, `a[j]` is updated by subtracting `m` from its current value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`; `k` is `k - 2m`; `n` is the value returned by `R()`; `k` is the value returned by `R()`; `j` is `n - 1`; `a[i]` is `a[i] - m`; `i` is 2 if `a[0] < 1` otherwise `i` is 0; `a[j]` is `a[j] - m`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `k` is `k - 2m`; `n` is the value returned by `R()`; `k` is the value returned by `R()`; `j` is `n - 1`; `a[i]` is `a[i] - m`; `i` is 2 if `a[0] < 1` otherwise `i` is 0; `a[j]` is `a[j] - m`**.
