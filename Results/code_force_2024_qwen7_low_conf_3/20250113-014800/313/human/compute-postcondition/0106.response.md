The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Before this operation, `n` is an integer read from input and `k` is an integer (since both are read together using `map(int, input().split())`). The other variables (`t`, `a`, `lit`, `sunk`, `k`, `lastState`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is empty, `sunk` is 0, `lastState` is -1**
