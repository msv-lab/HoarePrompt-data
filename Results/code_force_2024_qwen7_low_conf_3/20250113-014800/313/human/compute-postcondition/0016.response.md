The code snippet `a[i] -= m` subtracts the value of `m` from the element at index `i` in the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `k` is reduced by `2 * m`, and `m` retains its original value. The state of `k` and `m` does not change directly due to the operation on `a[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is reduced by `2 * m`, `m` retains its original value, the element at index `i` in list `a` is decreased by `m`**
