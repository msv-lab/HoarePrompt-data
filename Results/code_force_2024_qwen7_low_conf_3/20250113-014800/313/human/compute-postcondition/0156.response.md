Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 6`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 3, and `lastState` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the deque `lit` until it is empty or `k` becomes less than or equal to 0.
- In each iteration, `sunk` is incremented by 1, and either the last element (if `lastState` was -1) or the first element (if `lastState` was 0) of `lit` is removed.
- After three iterations, `lit` becomes an empty deque, `sunk` is 3, and `k` is reduced by the sum of the elements in `lit`, which is 6.
- The `lastState` remains -1 because `lit` is empty when the loop breaks.
- Finally, the value of `sunk` is printed.
