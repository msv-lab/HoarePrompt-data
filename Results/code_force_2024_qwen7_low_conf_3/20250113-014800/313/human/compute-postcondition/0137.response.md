`lit` is an empty deque, so the `pop` operation will remove the last element from the deque. Since the deque is empty, this operation will remove nothing and `lit` will remain empty. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, `u` is undefined.**
