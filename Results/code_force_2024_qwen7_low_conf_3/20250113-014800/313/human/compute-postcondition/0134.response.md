Postcondition: ***`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u` (where `u` is `lit[0]`), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 1, and `u` is undefined. If `lastState` equals 0, no changes are made. If `lastState` equals -1, no changes are made as well. The condition `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0` remains unchanged.***
