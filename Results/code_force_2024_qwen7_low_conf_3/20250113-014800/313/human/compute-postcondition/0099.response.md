The code `lit.popleft()` removes the first element from the list `lit`. Since `u` is defined based on the last element of `lit` when `lastState` is -1 or 0, and `sunk` is increased by 1, these changes will affect the values of `u` and `sunk`.

- `lit.popleft()` removes the first element from `lit`.
- `u` is updated to the new last element of `lit` (which was previously the second element).
- `sunk` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lit` has its first element removed, `u` is now equal to the new last element of `lit`, and `sunk` is increased by 1**.
