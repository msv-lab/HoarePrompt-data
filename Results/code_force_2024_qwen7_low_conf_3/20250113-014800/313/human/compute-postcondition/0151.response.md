`lit.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `lit`. Since `lit` is initially an empty deque, attempting to remove an element from an empty deque will result in a `IndexError` if we consider the typical behavior of deques in Python. However, given the context of the problem, we assume that the deque was intended to be populated before this operation, and we will proceed under the assumption that the deque was modified in some way prior to this line of code.

Given the initial state where `lit` is an empty deque, the operation will result in an error, but for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the deque was populated correctly before this line. After the operation, the deque will no longer have its leftmost element.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 2*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque without its leftmost element, `sunk` is 3, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement.**
