The code snippet sets `j` to `n - 1`. Based on the initial state, `n` is the value returned by `R()`, which is not specified further in the initial state. The value of `j` is now `n - 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are updated, `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`, `n` is the value returned by `R()`, `k` is the value of `initial k - 2 * m * (number of iterations)`**
