The line `lastState = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `lastState`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `lastState` and keeps the values of the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u` (where `u` is `lit[0]`), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 1, `lastState` is -1, and `u` is undefined. If `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, the condition remains unchanged.**
