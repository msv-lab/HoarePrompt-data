The code reads a list of integers from the input using `deque(list(map(int, input().split())))` and assigns it to the variable `lit`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `sunk`, and `lastState` remain unchanged. 

Let's assume the input for `deque(list(map(int, input().split())))` is a sequence of integers, say `[1, 2, 3]`. This means `lit` will be a `deque` containing these integers.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque([1, 2, 3]), `sunk` is 0, `lastState` is -1**
