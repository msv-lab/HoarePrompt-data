The code `k -= u` decrements the value of `k` by `u`. Given the initial state, we know that `k` was initially `k - 2*u`. After executing the code, the new value of `k` will be `(k - 2*u) - u`, which simplifies to `k - 3*u`.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `lit`, `sunk`, and `lastState`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 3*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque with or without its leftmost element, `sunk` is 3, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement. If `u <= k`, then `lit` has its leftmost element removed or remains unchanged.**
