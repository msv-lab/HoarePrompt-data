The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case within `t`, there are three parameters:
  - `n`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `k`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
  - `a`: A list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), representing the durability of the \(i\)-th ship.

Additionally, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the provided output cases, the function returns different values depending on the relationship between `n` and `k` and the list `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a parameter `t` and, for each test case within `t`, accept parameters `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. The function then processes these parameters and returns a specific value based on certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, and for each test case within `t`, it accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It returns a specific value based on the conditions related to `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.**
