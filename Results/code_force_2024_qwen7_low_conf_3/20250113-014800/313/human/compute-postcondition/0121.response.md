`sunk` is incremented by 1. The value of `sunk` was initially 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque([`lit[0]`]), `sunk` is 1, `u` is `lit[0]`, and the current value of `u` is less than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque([`lit[0]`]), `sunk` is 1, `u` is `lit[0]`, and the current value of `u` is less than or equal to `k`**
