The code snippet unpacks the result of `R()` into a tuple `*a`. Since `R()` returns two values (the values of `n` and `k`), `a` will be a tuple containing these two values. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the values returned from `R()`. 

Given the initial state where `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value returned by `R()`, and `k` is the value returned by `R()`, after executing the code, `t` remains `t - 1`, and both `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `R()`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `R()`**
