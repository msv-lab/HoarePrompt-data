`lit` is an empty deque, so calling `popleft()` on it will raise an error or return `None` if we consider the behavior of deques in Python. However, since the initial state mentions that `lit` is empty, the operation `lit.popleft()` will effectively leave `lit` unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u` (where `u` is `lit[0]`), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is undefined.**
