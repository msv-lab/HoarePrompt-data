The initial state is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `R()`, `i` is 0. The code snippet assigns `n - 1` to `j`. Since `n` is one of the values returned by `R()`, the new value of `j` is `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `R()`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
