Postcondition: ***`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 1, and `u` is undefined. If `lastState == -1`, then `lit` becomes an empty deque. Otherwise, `lit` remains unchanged as an empty deque.***
