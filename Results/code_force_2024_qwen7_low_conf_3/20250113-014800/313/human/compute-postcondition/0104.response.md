The code simply prints the value of `sunk`. Since `sunk` is initially defined as the number of elements originally in `lit`, and `lit` is initially empty, `sunk` is 0. Printing this value does not change the value of `sunk`. Therefore, the value of `sunk` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is empty, `sunk` is 0, `k` is 0, `lastState` is -1.**
