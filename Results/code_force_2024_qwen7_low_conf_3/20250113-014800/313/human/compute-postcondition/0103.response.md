Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is empty, `sunk` is the number of elements originally in `lit`, `k` is 0, `lastState` is -1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when either `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`. This means the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in `lit` and `k` is greater than 0.
2. **Processing Elements**: For each iteration, the element `u` is taken from either the beginning (if `lastState` is not -1) or the end (if `lastState` is -1) of `lit`.
3. **Updating Variables**:
   - `sunk` is incremented by 1 each time `u <= k`.
   - `k` is reduced by the value of `u`.
   - If `u` is less than or equal to `k` and `lastState` is -1, the last element of `lit` is popped.
   - If `u` is less than or equal to `k` and `lastState` is not -1, the first element of `lit` is popleft.
4. **Final State**:
   - Once `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, the loop breaks.
   - At this point, `lit` is empty because all elements have been processed.
   - `sunk` is the count of elements originally in `lit` because each valid `u` increments `sunk`.
   - `k` is 0 because it is reduced by the sum of all processed elements.
   - `lastState` is -1 because it alternates between -1 and 0, and the loop ends when no more elements are left to process.
