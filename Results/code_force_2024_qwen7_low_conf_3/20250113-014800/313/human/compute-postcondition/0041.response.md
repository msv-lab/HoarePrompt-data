The initial state includes:
- \( t \) is \( t - 1 \)
- \( k \) must be greater than 0
- \( a[0] \) is \( a_0 - m \)
- \( n \) and \( k \) are the values returned by \( R() \)
- \( i \) is 1 if \( a_0 < 1 \), otherwise \( i \) is 0
- \( j \) is \( n - 1 \)
- \( a[j] \) is \( a[j] - m - m \) if \( a_j \text{ (initial)} - m < 1 \), otherwise \( a[j] - m \)

The code `k -= m * 2` means that the value of `k` is decreased by `2 * m`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `m`, we'll keep it as `m`.

Output State: **\( t \) is \( t - 1 \), \( k \) is \( k - 2m \), \( n \) and \( k \) are the values returned by \( R() \), \( i \) is 1 if \( a_0 < 1 \), otherwise \( i \) is 0, \( j \) is \( n - 1 \), \( a[j] \) is \( a[j] - m - m \) if \( a_j \text{ (initial)} - m < 1 \), otherwise \( a[j] - m \)**
