`a[j]` is assigned the value of `a[j] - m`. From the initial state, `j` is `n - 1` and `n` is the value returned by `R()`. Since `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n - 1`, which is at least 1. The value of `a[j]` is updated by subtracting `m` from its current value. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `2 * m`, `a[0]` is `a0 - m`, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `R()`, `i` is 1 if `a0 < 1`, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `a[j]` is `a[j] - m`.**
