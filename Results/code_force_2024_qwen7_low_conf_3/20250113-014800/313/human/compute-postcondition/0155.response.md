Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop have executed.

### Initial State
- `t` is `t_val - 1`
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` is an integer read from input
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers
- `lit` is a deque([1, 2, 3])
- `sunk` is 0
- `lastState` is -1

### Loop Code
```python
while True:
    if len(lit) == 0 or k <= 0:
        break
    if lastState == -1:
        lastState = 0
    else:
        lastState = -1
    u = lit[lastState]
    if u <= k:
        sunk += 1
        if lastState == -1:
            lit.pop()
        else:
            lit.popleft()
    k -= u
```

### Analysis

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `lastState` is set to 0.
   - `u` is the first element of `lit`, so `u = 1`.
   - Since `u <= k`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lit` is popped, removing `1`.
   - `k` is decremented by `1`.
   - `lastState` is updated to -1.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `lastState` is -1.
   - `u` is the next element in `lit`, so `u = 2`.
   - Since `u <= k`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lit` is popleft, removing `2`.
   - `k` is decremented by `2`.
   - `lastState` is updated to 0.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `lastState` is 0.
   - `u` is the next element in `lit`, so `u = 3`.
   - Since `u <= k`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lit` is popped, removing `3`.
   - `k` is decremented by `3`.
   - `lastState` is updated to -1.

4. **After Three Iterations:**
   - `lit` is now an empty deque.
   - `sunk` is 3.
   - `lastState` is -1 because `lit` is empty and the condition checks for `len(lit) == 0` before breaking the loop.
   - `k` is `k - 1 - 2 - 3 = k - 6`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The loop continues until `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`.
   - Each iteration decrements `k` by the elements of `lit` in sequence.
   - When `lit` is empty, the loop breaks.
   - `lastState` will be -1 if `lit` is empty when the loop exits.

### Final Output State
Given that the loop will continue until `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, and considering the behavior described above, the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

**Output State: `t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - sum(lit)`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 3, and `lastState` is -1.**

Note that `sum(lit)` is the sum of the elements in the deque `lit` before the loop starts.
