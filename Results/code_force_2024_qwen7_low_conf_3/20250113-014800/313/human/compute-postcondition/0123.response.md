The code `lit.pop()` removes and returns the last item of the deque `lit`. Given that `lit` is initialized as `deque([lit[0]])`, this means `lit` contains only one element, which is `lit[0]`. After calling `pop()`, `lit` will be empty.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `lit` is now an empty deque.
- No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `t` is `t_val - 1`
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` is an integer read from input
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers
- `lit` is an empty deque
- `sunk` is 1
- `u` is `lit[0]`, but since `lit` is now empty, `u` is no longer defined in the same way

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 1, `u` is undefined**
