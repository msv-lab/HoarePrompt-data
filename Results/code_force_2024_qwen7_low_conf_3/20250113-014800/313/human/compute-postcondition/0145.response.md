The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `lastState`. The value of `lastState` is now `0`, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `lastState` and retains the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 2*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, `lastState` is 0.**
