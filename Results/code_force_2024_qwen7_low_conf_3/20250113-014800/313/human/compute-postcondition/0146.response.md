The code `lastState = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `lastState`. This is the only change made to the variables in this snippet. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 2*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, `lastState` is -1.**
