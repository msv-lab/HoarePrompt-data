`t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`. The code `n, k = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified, we denote them as `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the value returned by `R()`, `k` is the value returned by `R()`**
