Postcondition: ***`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 1, and `u` is undefined. If `u` (which is `lit[0]`) is less than or equal to `k`, then `lit` remains an empty deque and `sunk` is 1. If `u` is greater than `k`, then the conditions of `lit` and `sunk` do not change.***
