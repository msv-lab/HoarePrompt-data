Postcondition: ***`lit` is a list, `k` is an integer, `u` is equal to the original first element of `lit` before the operation, `sunk` is incremented by 1. If `u <= k`, and `lastState == -1`, then `lit` is a list with one less element. Otherwise, `lit` is a list with its first element removed. Since there is no else part, the only possible outcome when `u > k` is that `lit` remains unchanged.***
