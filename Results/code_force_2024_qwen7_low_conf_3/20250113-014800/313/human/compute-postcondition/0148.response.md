The code assigns `u` the value of `lit[lastState]`. Given that `lit` is an empty deque, accessing `lit[lastState]` will raise an IndexError unless `lastState` is 0 (since deques support negative indexing, but an empty deque cannot have any items). However, since `lastState` is either 0 or -1, and an empty deque cannot be accessed, the code will raise an error and the state of the variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - 2*u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement. An IndexError is raised due to the empty deque.**
