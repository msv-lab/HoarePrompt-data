The code `lit.pop()` removes the last element from the list `lit`. This affects the variable `lit`. The variable `k` remains unchanged, and the variable `u` is reassigned based on the new state of `lit` after the pop operation. Since `u` was initially defined as `lit[-1]` if `lastState` is -1, or `lit[0]` if `lastState` is 0, after the pop operation, the value of `u` will be `lit[0]` if `lastState` is -1, and will no longer be defined if `lastState` is 0 (because `lit[0]` would refer to a non-existent element). The variable `sunk` is increased by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lit` has its last element removed, `k` remains unchanged, `u` is equal to `lit[0]` if `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is increased by 1**.
