The code `lit.popleft()` removes the first element from the list `lit`. The variable `u` was previously set to `lit[0]`, so after removing the first element, `u` will no longer refer to the original first element of `lit`. The value of `k` and `sunk` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lit` is a list with its first element removed, `k` is an integer, `u` is equal to the original first element of `lit` before the operation, `sunk` is incremented by 1**
