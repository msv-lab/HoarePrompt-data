Output State: **`t` is `t - 1 * (number of iterations)`, `k` is `initial k - 2 * m * (number of iterations)`, `n` is the value returned by `R()` each iteration, `i` is the index such that `a[i] < 1` or `i` is the next index where `a[i]` needs to be updated or remains `0` if no such index exists, `j` is the index such that `a[j] < 1` or `j` is the next index where `a[j]` needs to be updated or remains `n-1` if no such index exists, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are updated according to the loop operations, where `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`, `print(i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0))` is printed**
