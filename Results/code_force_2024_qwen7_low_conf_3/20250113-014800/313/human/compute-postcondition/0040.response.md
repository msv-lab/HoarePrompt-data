Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- \( t \) is \( t - 1 \)
- \( k \) is the initial value of \( k \) minus \( 2 \times m \)
- \( a[0] \) is \( a_0 - m \)
- \( n \) and \( k \) are the values returned by \( R() \)
- \( i \) is 1 if \( a_0 < 1 \), otherwise \( i \) is 0
- \( j \) is \( n - 1 - 1 \) if \( a_j \text{ (initial)} - m < 1 \), otherwise \( n - 1 \)
- \( a[j] \) is \( a[j] - m - m \) if \( a_j \text{ (initial)} - m < 1 \), otherwise \( a[j] - m \)

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as \( i < j \) and \( m = \min(a[i], a[j], k // 2) > 0 \).

2. **Ensuring \( i < j \)**:
   - We need to ensure that \( i < j \). From the given states, we know:
     - \( i \) is either 0 or 1 depending on \( a_0 \).
     - \( j \) is \( n - 2 \) if \( a_j \text{ (initial)} - m < 1 \), otherwise \( n - 1 \).
   - To ensure \( i < j \), we need \( j \) to be \( n - 1 \) (since \( i \) is at most 1).

3. **Ensuring \( m > 0 \)**:
   - \( m \) must be \( \min(a[i], a[j], k // 2) \) and must be positive.
   - Since \( a[i] \) and \( a[j] \) are already defined based on their initial values, we need to ensure \( k // 2 > 0 \).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - **\( j \)**: We need to adjust \( j \) to \( n - 1 \) to ensure \( i < j \).
   - **\( k \)**: We need to ensure \( k \) is such that \( k // 2 > 0 \).

### Final Adjusted States:

State: **\( t \) is \( t - 1 \), \( k \) must be greater than 0, \( a[0] \) is \( a_0 - m \), \( n \) and \( k \) are the values returned by \( R() \), \( i \) is 1 if \( a_0 < 1 \), otherwise \( i \) is 0, \( j \) is \( n - 1 \), \( a[j] \) is \( a[j] - m - m \) if \( a_j \text{ (initial)} - m < 1 \), otherwise \( a[j] - m \)**
