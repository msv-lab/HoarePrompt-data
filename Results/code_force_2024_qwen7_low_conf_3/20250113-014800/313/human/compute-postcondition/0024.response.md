`a[j]` is decreased by `m`. The value of `j` is unchanged, and it is still true that `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`. The value of `k` is also unchanged, and the conditions for `i` remain the same. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `a[j]`.

Output State: **`k` is reduced by `3 * m`, the element at index `i` in list `a` is decreased by `m`, the element at index `j` in list `a` is decreased by `2m`, and `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`; `i` is either `i + 1` or `i` depending on whether `k - 4 * m < 1.`**
