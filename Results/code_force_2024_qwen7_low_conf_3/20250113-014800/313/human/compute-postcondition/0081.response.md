The function `func` accepts a list of parameters, which includes:
- `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
- A list of `n` integers `a` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The function returns a value based on the given input parameters, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function then processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions.
