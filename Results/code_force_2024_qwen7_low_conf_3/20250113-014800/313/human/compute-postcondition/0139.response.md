Postcondition: ***`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is undefined. Since the condition `lastState == -1` is not specified and the else part has the same preconditions, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
