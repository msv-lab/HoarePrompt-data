Let's break down the given state and the `while True` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given State:
- `t` is `t_val - 1`
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` is an integer read from input
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers
- `lit` is a deque([1, 2, 3])
- `sunk` is 0
- `lastState` is -1

### Loop:
```
while True:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The `while True` loop means the loop will always execute as long as the loop condition is satisfied (which is always true in this case).
- Since the loop condition is always true, no specific state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least one more time.

### Conclusion:
No states need to be adjusted because the loop will always execute regardless of the current values of the variables.

### Answer:
State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque([1, 2, 3]), `sunk` is 0, `lastState` is -1**
