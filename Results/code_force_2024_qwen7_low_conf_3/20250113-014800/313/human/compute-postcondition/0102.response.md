Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `lit` is a list.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `sunk` is increased by 1.
   - If `lastState` is -1, the last element of `lit` is removed and `u` becomes the first element of the updated list.
   - If `lastState` is 0, the first element of `lit` is removed and `u` becomes the last element of the updated list.

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   k -= u
   ```
   This line subtracts the value of `u` from `k`.

3. Update the Variables:
   - The value of `k` is updated to `k - u`.
   - `sunk` is still increased by 1.
   - The value of `u` remains the same depending on whether `lastState` is -1 or 0.
   - `lit` is modified based on `lastState`, but the exact content of `lit` is not specified in the problem. We know that one element is removed, but the exact element removed and the new value of `u` is not specified unless `lastState` is given a specific value.

Since the exact values of `lastState`, `u`, and `lit` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact elements in `lit`. However, we know that one element was removed from `lit`, and `u` became either the first or the last element of the updated list depending on the value of `lastState`.

Output State: **`k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is increased by 1, and one element is removed from `lit`; `u` becomes the first or last element of the updated `lit` depending on the value of `lastState`.**
