`sunk` is incremented by 1, which means its value increases by 1. The values of `lit`, `k`, `u`, and `lastState` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`lit` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `u` is equal to `lit[-1]` if `lastState` is -1, or `lit[0]` if `lastState` is 0; `sunk` is increased by 1**
