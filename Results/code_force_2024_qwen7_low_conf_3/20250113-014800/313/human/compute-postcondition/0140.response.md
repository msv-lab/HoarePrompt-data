Postcondition: ***`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is `k - u`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is undefined. Since the condition `u <= k` is true, `sunk` is updated to 2. If `u` is greater than `k`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
