To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop: `i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is `n - 1`
   - `a[i]` and `a[j]` are updated
   - `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`
   - `n` is the value returned by `R()`
   - `k` is the value of `initial k - 2 * m * (number of iterations)`

2. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < j` and `m` is not `None` (since `m` is computed using `min()`).

3. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For `i < j` to hold true, `i` must be less than `j`.
   - Since `i` is 0 and `j` is `n - 1`, this condition is already met unless `n` is 1 (making `j` also 0).
   - The computation of `m` involves `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`. As long as these values are valid, `m` will be a non-negative number.

Given these points, the only potential issue is ensuring that `i < j` holds true. With `i` being 0 and `j` being `n - 1`, the only way to prevent the loop from executing is if `n` is 1, making `j` also 0.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that `j` is greater than `i`.

**Adjusted State**:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is `n - 1`
- `a[i]` and `a[j]` are updated
- `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is the value of `initial k - 2 * m * (number of iterations)`

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are updated, `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value of `initial k - 2 * m * (number of iterations)`**
