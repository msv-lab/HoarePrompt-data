The code `lastState = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `lastState`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. 

Output State: **`t` is `t_val - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `lit` is a deque([]), `sunk` is 0, `lastState` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement because either the length of `lit` is 0 or `k` is less than or equal to 0, and the condition `lastState == -1` is no longer true.**
