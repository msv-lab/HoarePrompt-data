Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. It then simulates the process of sinking ships based on their durability (`a`). A ship sinks if its durability is less than or equal to `k`. The function updates the durability list (`lit`) by removing the front or back element based on the simulation state and decreases `k` accordingly. The function calculates the total number of ships (`sunk`) that sink during this process and prints this count for each test case. The function handles edge cases such as when the durability list becomes empty or when `k` reaches zero, terminating the simulation.**

This summary covers all the potential cases and actions performed by the code, including handling empty durability lists and ensuring `k` does not go below zero.
