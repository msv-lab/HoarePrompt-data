To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state.

The `while` loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } i < j \text{ and } (m := \min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)) \]

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as \( i < j \) and \( m \) is defined.
   - \( m \) is set to the minimum of \( a[i] \), \( a[j] \), and \( k // 2 \).

2. **Current State**:
   - \( t = t - 1 \)
   - \( i \) is 1 if \( a[0] - m < 1 \), otherwise \( i \) is 0.
   - \( j \) is \( n - 2 \) if \( a[n-1] < 1 \), otherwise \( j \) is \( n - 1 \).
   - \( a[i] = a[0] - m \)
   - \( a[j] = a[n-1] - m \)
   - \( m \) is the minimum of \( a[0] - m \), \( a[n-1] \), and \( k // 2 \)
   - \( n \) is greater than 1
   - \( k = \text{initial } k - 2 \cdot m \cdot (\text{number of iterations} + 1) \)

3. **Loop Execution Continuation Condition**:
   - The loop continues if \( i < j \) and \( m \) is defined (which it always is since \( m \) is assigned).

4. **Ensuring \( i < j \)**:
   - For the loop to continue, \( i \) must be less than \( j \).

5. **Ensuring \( m \) is Defined**:
   - Since \( m \) is always assigned, this part is already satisfied.

6. **Updating States**:
   - To ensure \( i < j \) for the next iteration, we need to consider the values of \( i \) and \( j \):
     - \( i \) is either 0 or 1 based on the condition \( a[0] - m < 1 \).
     - \( j \) is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 1 \) based on the condition \( a[n-1] < 1 \).

7. **State Adjustments**:
   - If \( i \) is 0, then \( j \) must be \( n - 2 \) to satisfy \( i < j \).
   - If \( i \) is 1, then \( j \) must be \( n - 1 \) to satisfy \( i < j \).

Given that \( n \) is greater than 1 and \( k \) is updated accordingly, we need to ensure that \( i \) and \( j \) maintain the condition \( i < j \).

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 1 if `a[0] - m < 1`, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1` if `a[n-1] < 1`, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `a[i]` is `a[0] - m`, `a[j]` is `a[n-1] - m`, `m` is the minimum of `a[0] - m`, `a[n-1]`, and `k // 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value of `initial k - 2 * m * (number of iterations + 1)`**

This ensures that \( i < j \) for the next iteration of the loop.
