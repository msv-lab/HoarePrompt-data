Postcondition: ***The list `lit` remains unchanged, and the integer `k` remains unchanged.***

Explanation: The if condition checks whether the length of the list `lit` is 0 or if `k` is less than or equal to 0. In both the if part and the else part, no state changes occur. Therefore, the overall postcondition is that both `lit` and `k` remain in their original states.
