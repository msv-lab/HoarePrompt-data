You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the changes in the variables.
    #
    #### Analysis of the Loop
    #
    #1. **Initial Conditions:**
    #   - `t` is the initial number of iterations.
    #   - `n` is read from input and must be at least 2.
    #   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
    #   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9`.
    #
    #2. **Main Loop:**
    #   - The outer loop runs until `t` becomes 0.
    #   - Inside the outer loop, `t` is decremented by 1.
    #   - `n` and `k` are read from input.
    #   - `a` is read from input as a list of `n` integers.
    #   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
    #   - An inner loop runs as long as `i < j` and `m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)` is non-zero.
    #   - In each iteration of the inner loop:
    #     - `k` is decreased by `2 * m`.
    #     - `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each decreased by `m`.
    #     - `i` is incremented if `a[i] < 1`.
    #     - `j` is decremented if `a[j] < 1`.
    #
    #3. **Final Values After Outer Loop:**
    #   - `t` will be 0 after the outer loop completes.
    #   - The value of `n` will be the `n` read from the last iteration.
    #   - The value of `k` will be the final non-negative remainder after all possible iterations of the loop.
    #   - `i` and `j` will be the indices where the loop conditions `i < j` are no longer satisfied.
    #   - `a[i]` and `a[j]` will be updated according to the loop operations.
    #
    #4. **Print Statement:**
    #   - The print statement outputs `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop have executed:
    #
    #- `t` will be 0.
    #- `n` will be the `n` read from the last iteration.
    #- `k` will be the final non-negative remainder after all possible iterations of the loop.
    #- `i` will be the smallest index such that `a[i] < 1` or `i` is the next index where `a[i]` needs to be updated or remains `0` if no such index exists.
    #- `j` will be the largest index such that `a[j] < 1` or `j` is the next index where `a[j]` needs to be updated or remains `n-1` if no such index exists.
    #- `a[i]` and `a[j]` will be updated according to the loop operations.
    #- The print statement will output `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:
    #
    #**Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is the value of `n` read from the last iteration, `k` is the final non-negative remainder after all possible iterations of the loop, `i` is the smallest index such that `a[i] < 1` or `i` is the next index where `a[i]` needs to be updated or remains `0` if no such index exists, `j` is the largest index such that `a[j] < 1` or `j` is the next index where `a[j]` needs to be updated or remains `n-1` if no such index exists, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are updated according to the loop operations, and the print statement outputs `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.**



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program uses a heuristic approach to reduce the durability of ships and determine the number of ships sunk, but it does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attacks according to the problem description. The issue arises because the program assumes that the minimum durability between the first and last ship is always used in each iteration, which does not always reflect the correct behavior of the Kraken's attacks.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 4
  2 1 3
  ```

According to the problem description:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability from 2 to 1.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability from 3 to 2.
3. The Kraken attacks the first ship again, reducing its durability from 1 to 0, sinking the first ship.
4. The Kraken attacks the last ship again, reducing its durability from 2 to 1.
5. The Kraken attacks the first ship again, but since the first ship is already sunk, it does not attack it. Instead, it attacks the last ship, reducing its durability from 1 to 0, sinking the last ship.

Thus, after 4 attacks, both ships should sink, resulting in 2 ships being sunk. However, the program incorrectly counts the number of ships sunk and does not accurately reflect the sequence of attacks. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the described behavior and is incorrect.
