You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

# Execution Summary:
The function processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function iterates over the elements of `a` using two pointers, `i` starting at 0 and `j` starting at `n-1`. It repeatedly reduces the values of `a[i]` and `a[j]` by the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k//2` while `i < j` and there is still a non-zero reduction possible. After processing, it prints a value based on the final state of `i`, `j`, and the remaining value of `k`.

The function ensures:
- If `a[i]` or `a[j]` becomes less than 1, the respective pointer (`i` or `j`) is adjusted.
- The process continues until `i` is no longer less than `j` or no further reduction is possible.
- The final output is calculated as `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`, which represents the count of elements that need to be processed and whether there is any remaining value in `k` that can be applied to `a[i]`.

Edge Cases:
- If `n == 1`, the function processes only one element, reducing it by the minimum of `a[0]` and `k//2` and adjusts `i` or `j` accordingly.
- If `k` is zero initially or becomes zero during the processing, no further reductions occur.
- If `a[i]` or `a[j]` is zero, the corresponding pointer is adjusted, and the loop continues.
- The function handles the scenario where `a[i]` or `a[j]` is reduced to less than 1, adjusting the pointers appropriately.
