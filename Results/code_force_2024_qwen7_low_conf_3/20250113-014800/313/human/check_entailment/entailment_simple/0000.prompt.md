You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 \le k \le 10^{15}, and a list of n integers a where 1 \le a_i \le 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = R()
        
        *a, = R()
        
        i = 0
        
        j = n - 1
        
        while i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)):
            k -= m * 2
            a[i] -= m
            i += a[i] < 1
            a[j] -= m
            j -= a[j] < 1
        
        print(i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the changes in the variables.
    #
    #### Analysis of the Loop
    #
    #1. **Initial Conditions:**
    #   - `t` is the initial number of iterations.
    #   - `n` is read from input and must be at least 2.
    #   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
    #   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9`.
    #
    #2. **Main Loop:**
    #   - The outer loop runs until `t` becomes 0.
    #   - Inside the outer loop, `t` is decremented by 1.
    #   - `n` and `k` are read from input.
    #   - `a` is read from input as a list of `n` integers.
    #   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
    #   - An inner loop runs as long as `i < j` and `m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)` is non-zero.
    #   - In each iteration of the inner loop:
    #     - `k` is decreased by `2 * m`.
    #     - `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each decreased by `m`.
    #     - `i` is incremented if `a[i] < 1`.
    #     - `j` is decremented if `a[j] < 1`.
    #
    #3. **Final Values After Outer Loop:**
    #   - `t` will be 0 after the outer loop completes.
    #   - The value of `n` will be the `n` read from the last iteration.
    #   - The value of `k` will be the final non-negative remainder after all possible iterations of the loop.
    #   - `i` and `j` will be the indices where the loop conditions `i < j` are no longer satisfied.
    #   - `a[i]` and `a[j]` will be updated according to the loop operations.
    #
    #4. **Print Statement:**
    #   - The print statement outputs `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop have executed:
    #
    #- `t` will be 0.
    #- `n` will be the `n` read from the last iteration.
    #- `k` will be the final non-negative remainder after all possible iterations of the loop.
    #- `i` will be the smallest index such that `a[i] < 1` or `i` is the next index where `a[i]` needs to be updated or remains `0` if no such index exists.
    #- `j` will be the largest index such that `a[j] < 1` or `j` is the next index where `a[j]` needs to be updated or remains `n-1` if no such index exists.
    #- `a[i]` and `a[j]` will be updated according to the loop operations.
    #- The print statement will output `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:
    #
    #**Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is the value of `n` read from the last iteration, `k` is the final non-negative remainder after all possible iterations of the loop, `i` is the smallest index such that `a[i] < 1` or `i` is the next index where `a[i]` needs to be updated or remains `0` if no such index exists, `j` is the largest index such that `a[j] < 1` or `j` is the next index where `a[j]` needs to be updated or remains `n-1` if no such index exists, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are updated according to the loop operations, and the print statement outputs `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.**

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
