Reasoning: 
- The problem requires replacing question marks in a string with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring.
- `func_1` is designed to find the longest tandem repeat substring by iterating over possible lengths of the first half of the tandem repeat (`d`) and using `func_2` to check if the characters at positions `i` and `i + d` can form part of a tandem repeat.
- `func_2` correctly checks if two characters can be part of a tandem repeat by considering both matching characters and characters that are question marks.
- Given the constraints and the logic used, `func_1` should work correctly to find the longest possible tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks.
- The provided example test cases align with the expected behavior of the functions. The outputs match the desired results for different input scenarios, including strings with only question marks, strings without possible tandem repeats, and strings with mixed characters and question marks.

Correctness: **True**
