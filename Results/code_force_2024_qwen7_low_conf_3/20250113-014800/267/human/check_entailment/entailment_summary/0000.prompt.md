You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

# Functions with Execution Summary:

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        result = func_1(s)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    for d in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        count = sum((1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d])))
        for l in range(n - 2 * d):
            if l > 0:
                count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
                count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
            if count == d:
                max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)
    return max_length

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a maximum length of 5000. It iterates through possible values of `d` (from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`), where `n` is the length of `s`. For each `d`, it calculates `count` as the number of pairs of characters at positions `i` and `i + d` that satisfy a condition defined in `func_2`. It then updates `max_length` to be the maximum value of `2 * d` where `count == d`. If no such `d` is found, `max_length` remains 0. After the loop, the function returns `max_length`. This means that the function finds the longest substring in `s` that can be partitioned into non-overlapping pairs of characters that satisfy the condition in `func_2`, and returns twice the number of such pairs. If no valid partitioning exists, it returns 0.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    return a == b or a == '?' or b == '?'
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are both single characters. It returns `True` under three conditions: when `a` is equal to `b`, when `a` is `'?'`, or when `b` is `'?'`. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases where `a` or `b` can be either a lowercase Latin letter or `'?'`. There are no missing functionalities as the provided code covers all specified conditions.
