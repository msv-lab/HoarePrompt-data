Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring in a given string `s`.
2. The algorithm in `func_1` iterates through possible lengths of the tandem repeats (`d`) up to half the length of the string.
3. For each possible length `d`, it uses a helper function `func_2` to check for matching characters between the two halves of potential tandem repeats.
4. The variable `count` keeps track of how many matching characters there are between the first half and the second half of the current potential tandem repeat.
5. As the algorithm progresses, it updates the `max_length` variable whenever it finds a longer tandem repeat.
6. However, the implementation of `func_1` has a few issues:
   - It does not correctly handle the replacement of question marks (`?`) in the string.
   - The logic to update `count` when shifting the window of comparison is flawed and may not properly account for question marks.
   - The overall approach of checking every possible tandem repeat of length `d` is inefficient and may miss optimal solutions.

Given these issues, let's analyze whether the provided solution meets the requirements:

- The solution does not attempt to replace question marks before finding the tandem repeat.
- The logic for updating `count` does not properly account for the presence of question marks, which could lead to incorrect counts.
- The approach does not guarantee finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat after replacing all question marks optimally.

Since the provided solution does not correctly handle the replacement of question marks and does not ensure the maximum length of the tandem repeat is found, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
