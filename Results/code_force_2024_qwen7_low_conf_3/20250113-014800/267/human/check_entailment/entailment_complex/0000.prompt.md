You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        result = func_1(s)
        print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of s is at most 5000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    for d in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        count = sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d]))
        
        for l in range(n - 2 * d):
            if l > 0:
                count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
                count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
            if count == d:
                max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` found during the loop's execution where `count == d`, `d` is the last value of `d` used in the loop, `count` is the final value of `count` after all iterations of the loop have finished. If the loop does not execute, then `max_length` remains 0, `d` is `n // 2 + 1`, and `count` remains its initial value 0.
    return max_length
    #The program returns max_length which is the maximum value of 2 * d found during the loop's execution where count == d, or 0 if the loop does not execute.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a maximum length of 5000. It iterates through possible values of `d` (from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`), where `n` is the length of `s`. For each `d`, it calculates `count` as the number of pairs of characters at positions `i` and `i + d` that satisfy a condition defined in `func_2`. It then updates `max_length` to be the maximum value of `2 * d` where `count == d`. If no such `d` is found, `max_length` remains 0. After the loop, the function returns `max_length`. This means that the function finds the longest substring in `s` that can be partitioned into non-overlapping pairs of characters that satisfy the condition in `func_2`, and returns twice the number of such pairs. If no valid partitioning exists, it returns 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are single characters, where a is either a lowercase Latin letter or '?', and b is either a lowercase Latin letter or '?'.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a == b or a == '?' or b == '?'
    #The program returns True if 'a' is equal to 'b', or if 'a' is '?', or if 'b' is '?'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are both single characters. It returns `True` under three conditions: when `a` is equal to `b`, when `a` is `'?'`, or when `b` is `'?'`. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases where `a` or `b` can be either a lowercase Latin letter or `'?'`. There are no missing functionalities as the provided code covers all specified conditions.
