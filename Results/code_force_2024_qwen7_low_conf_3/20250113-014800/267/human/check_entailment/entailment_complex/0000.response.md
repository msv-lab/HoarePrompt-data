Reasoning:
- The overall goal of the program is to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring by replacing each question mark (`?`) with a lowercase Latin letter.
- Function `func_1` attempts to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring by iterating through possible half-lengths `d` and using `func_2` to check if characters at corresponding positions in the string match or could match after replacement.
- Function `func_2` correctly checks if two characters are equal or if one or both are question marks, ensuring that the conditions for forming a tandem repeat are met.
- The logic within `func_1` correctly updates the `max_length` whenever a valid tandem repeat of length `2 * d` is found. If no such tandem repeat exists, the function correctly returns `0`.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated functions, the program correctly implements the solution and should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
