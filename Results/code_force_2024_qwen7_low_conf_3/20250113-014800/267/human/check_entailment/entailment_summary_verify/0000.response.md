Reasoning:

The original assessment is inaccurate. Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the function summary and the problem description.

1. **Understanding `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly checks if two characters match or if one of them is a question mark. This is crucial for identifying tandem repeats.

2. **Understanding `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible half-lengths `d` of tandem repeats.
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check if the substring `s[i:i+d]` matches `s[i+d:i+2*d]`.
   - The variable `count` keeps track of how many characters in the window match according to `func_2`.
   - If `count` equals `d`, it means the entire window forms a tandem repeat, and `max_length` is updated accordingly.

3. **Checking the logic:**
   - The function `func_1` does not explicitly replace question marks; instead, it checks for possible tandem repeats by comparing adjacent segments.
   - The function `func_2` ensures that question marks can match any character, which is exactly what we need to maximize the length of tandem repeats.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input string `"code?????s"`.
     - The function will check various lengths of potential tandem repeats.
     - For `d = 5`, it will check `"code???"` vs `"????s"`.
     - Since `func_2` allows question marks to match any character, the function can indeed identify that replacing the question marks to form `"codexxxxxxs"` results in a tandem repeat of length 10.
   - The function correctly identifies that the maximum length of a tandem repeat is 10, even though it does not explicitly replace the question marks.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks. The function summary for `func_2` also correctly supports this functionality.

Final: **True**
