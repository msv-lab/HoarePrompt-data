You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    for d in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        count = sum((1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d])))
        for l in range(n - 2 * d):
            if l > 0:
                count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
                count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
            if count == d:
                max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)
    return max_length

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a == b or a == '?' or b == '?'



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are both single characters. It returns `True` under three conditions: when `a` is equal to `b`, when `a` is `'?'`, or when `b` is `'?'`. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases where `a` or `b` can be either a lowercase Latin letter or `'?'`. There are no missing functionalities as the provided code covers all specified conditions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring in a given string `s`.
2. The algorithm in `func_1` iterates through possible lengths of the tandem repeats (`d`) up to half the length of the string.
3. For each possible length `d`, it uses a helper function `func_2` to check for matching characters between the two halves of potential tandem repeats.
4. The variable `count` keeps track of how many matching characters there are between the first half and the second half of the current potential tandem repeat.
5. As the algorithm progresses, it updates the `max_length` variable whenever it finds a longer tandem repeat.
6. However, the implementation of `func_1` has a few issues:
   - It does not correctly handle the replacement of question marks (`?`) in the string.
   - The logic to update `count` when shifting the window of comparison is flawed and may not properly account for question marks.
   - The overall approach of checking every possible tandem repeat of length `d` is inefficient and may miss optimal solutions.

Given these issues, let's analyze whether the provided solution meets the requirements:

- The solution does not attempt to replace question marks before finding the tandem repeat.
- The logic for updating `count` does not properly account for the presence of question marks, which could lead to incorrect counts.
- The approach does not guarantee finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat after replacing all question marks optimally.

Since the provided solution does not correctly handle the replacement of question marks and does not ensure the maximum length of the tandem repeat is found, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
