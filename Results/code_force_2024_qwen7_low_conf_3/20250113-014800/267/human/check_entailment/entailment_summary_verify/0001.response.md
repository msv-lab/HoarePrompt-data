### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the given problem and the provided functions to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring by replacing each question mark ('?') with a lowercase Latin letter. The function `func_1` aims to find this maximum length by iterating over possible lengths of tandem repeats (`d`). The function `func_2` checks if two characters match, considering '?' as a wildcard.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Iteration Over Possible Lengths**: The outer loop iterates over possible lengths `d` from 1 to half the length of the string `n // 2 + 1`.
2. **Count Matching Characters**: The inner loop uses `func_2` to count how many characters match between the first half and the second half of the current potential tandem repeat.
3. **Updating `max_length`**: If the number of matching characters equals `d`, it means the current segment is a valid tandem repeat, and `max_length` is updated accordingly.
4. **Shifting Window**: The inner loop shifts the window of comparison by adjusting `count` to reflect changes in the first half and the second half of the string.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function correctly handles matching characters, including '?' as a wildcard.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Replacement of Question Marks**: The original assessment correctly points out that the solution does not explicitly replace question marks before finding the tandem repeat. However, the logic within `func_1` implicitly handles this by checking matches using `func_2`.
2. **Flawed Logic for Updating `count`**: The original assessment suggests that the logic for updating `count` is flawed, but the summary of `func_2` indicates that it correctly handles question marks. Therefore, the main issue lies in the assumption that the logic for shifting windows does not account for question marks effectively.

#### Re-evaluation:
- The function `func_1` implicitly replaces question marks by treating them as wildcards during the matching process. This is consistent with the function `func_2` which correctly handles '?' as a wildcard.
- The logic for shifting the window of comparison should correctly account for question marks, as `func_2` is used to verify matches.

Given that `func_2` correctly handles question marks as wildcards and the shifting logic in `func_1` uses this function to verify matches, the solution should work as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment identified some issues but did not fully address the correct handling of question marks through `func_2`. After re-evaluating, we conclude that the program correctly maximizes the length of the longest tandem repeat substring by implicitly replacing question marks.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
