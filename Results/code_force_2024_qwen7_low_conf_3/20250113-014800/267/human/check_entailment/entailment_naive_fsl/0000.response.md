Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring after replacing each question mark. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the length of tandem repeats but does not ensure that the question marks are replaced optimally to achieve the maximum length of tandem repeats.

To illustrate, consider the input string `"code?????s"`. The expected output is `10`, which means we should replace the question marks to form a tandem repeat of length 10. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this. For instance, if we replace the question marks to form `"codexxxxxxs"`, the function will not correctly identify the tandem repeat of length 10 because it only checks for existing matches and does not consider the optimal replacement of question marks.

A correct approach would involve generating all possible combinations of replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters and then checking each combination to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring. This is beyond the scope of the current implementation, hence the program is incorrect.
