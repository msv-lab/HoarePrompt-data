You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        result = func_1(s)
        print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of s is at most 5000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    for d in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        count = sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d]))
        
        for l in range(n - 2 * d):
            if l > 0:
                count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
                count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
            if count == d:
                max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` found during the loop's execution where `count == d`, `d` is the last value of `d` used in the loop, `count` is the final value of `count` after all iterations of the loop have finished. If the loop does not execute, then `max_length` remains 0, `d` is `n // 2 + 1`, and `count` remains its initial value 0.
    return max_length
    #The program returns max_length which is the maximum value of 2 * d found during the loop's execution where count == d, or 0 if the loop does not execute.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are single characters, where a is either a lowercase Latin letter or '?', and b is either a lowercase Latin letter or '?'.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a == b or a == '?' or b == '?'
    #The program returns True if 'a' is equal to 'b', or if 'a' is '?', or if 'b' is '?'


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
