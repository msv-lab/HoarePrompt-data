Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to replace the question marks ('?') with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Instead, the program only checks for existing tandem repeats in the given string without making any replacements.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly checks if two characters match, considering '?' as a wildcard. However, it is used within `func_1` only to check for existing tandem repeats, not to replace '?' characters.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to find the longest tandem repeat substring but does not perform any replacements. It iterates through possible tandem repeat lengths (`d`) and counts matching characters, but it does not modify the string `s` to replace '?' with appropriate characters to form longer tandem repeats.

3. **Replacement Logic**: The problem requires replacing '?' with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. The provided code does not implement this logic at all.

To fix this, the program should:
- Replace '?' with appropriate lowercase Latin letters.
- Check if these replacements result in longer tandem repeats.
- Return the maximum length of such tandem repeats.

In summary, the current implementation does not address the core requirement of replacing '?' to maximize the tandem repeat length, hence it is incorrect.
