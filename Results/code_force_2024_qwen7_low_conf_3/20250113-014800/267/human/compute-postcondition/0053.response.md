`count` is updated by adding the value returned by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its original value. The value of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` is subtracted from `count` in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`count` is updated by adding the value returned by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its original value after subtracting the value returned by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks; `n` is at least 1; `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`; `l` is greater than 0**
