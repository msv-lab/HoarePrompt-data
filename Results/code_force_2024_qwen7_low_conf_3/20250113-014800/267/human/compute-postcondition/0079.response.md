`match_count` is reassigned the value `0`. The value of `match_count` was previously either `1` or `0`, and now it is explicitly set to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `s` is a string with a length of at least 4, `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and `sub_len`, `match_count` is 0, `sub_len` is `len(s) // 2 - 2` and is less than the length of `s`, `i` is 2**
