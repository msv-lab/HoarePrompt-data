Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`.
   - `l` is a non-negative integer and equals `k + 1`, where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration.
   - `count` is updated based on the previous value of `l` and the new value of `l`.
   - `max_length` is updated if `count == d` and `2 * d` is greater than the current `max_length`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
   ```

3. Let's analyze the impact:
   - `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` is called with two arguments: `s[l - 1]` and `s[l - 1 + d]`.
   - The result of `func_2` is subtracted from `count`.

4. Since the function `func_2` is not defined in the problem statement, we assume it returns a numeric value (either an integer or a float).

5. After the subtraction, the value of `count` is updated.

6. The variables `s`, `n`, `d`, `l`, and `max_length` remain unchanged unless specifically mentioned otherwise.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is a non-negative integer and equals `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), `count` is decreased by the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, and `max_length` remains unchanged.**
