Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 0, `d` is 1, `count` is updated based on the following: if `l > 0`, `count` is decreased by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l])` and then increased by `func_2(s[l], s[l + 1])`. Otherwise, no change to `count` is made.***
