The code `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` updates the value of `count` by subtracting the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from `count`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. We only know that `count` is updated based on the return value of `func_2`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`.
- `l` is greater than 0.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `count`, which depends on the unspecified function `func_2`.

Output State: **`count` is updated by subtracting the value returned by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from its original value, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is greater than 0**.
