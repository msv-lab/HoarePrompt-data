The code `count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` updates the `count` variable by adding the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its current value. However, the exact behavior of `func_2` is not specified, so we'll leave it in terms of the function call. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `max_length` is 2.
- `d` is 1.
- `count` is decreased by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.

After the code runs, the updated state is:
- `count` is now `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1, `count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])**.
