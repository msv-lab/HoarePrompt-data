Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `s` is a string with a length of at least 4, `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and `sub_len`, `match_count` is either 1 or 0, `sub_len` is `len(s) // 2 - 2` and is less than the length of `s`, `i` is 2. If `s[i] == s[i + sub_len]` or `s[i] == '?'` or `s[i + sub_len] == '?'`, then `match_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `match_count` remains unchanged.**
