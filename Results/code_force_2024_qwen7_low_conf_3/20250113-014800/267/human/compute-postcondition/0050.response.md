Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `l` in the range `n - 2 * d`.

2. **Understand the Range**: For the loop to execute, the expression `n - 2 * d` must be at least 1 because the range function generates values from 0 up to but not including the given limit. 

3. **Check the Initial State**:
   - We know `n` is at least 1 (`n >= 1`).
   - We know `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`. This ensures that `n - 2 * d` will be at least 1.

4. **Loop Execution Requirement**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n - 2 * d` is at least 1. Since `d` is an integer and satisfies the inequality `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, we can deduce that `n - 2 * d` will indeed be at least 1.

5. **Initial Values in the Loop**:
   - `l` will start at 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 2 * d - 1`.

6. **States to Adjust**:
   - `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` must be at least 1, and `d` must be an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`.
   - The initial value of `l` should be 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is 0**.
