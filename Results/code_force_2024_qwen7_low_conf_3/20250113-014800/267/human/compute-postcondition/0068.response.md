The code updates the `max_length` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. Since the exact value of `d` is not specified, we can only express `max_length` in terms of `d`.

- The value of `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`.
- Other variables (`s`, `n`, `d`, `l`, `count`, and `func_2`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is `k + 2` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), `count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, and `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`.**
