Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are both single characters. It returns `True` under three conditions: when `a` is equal to `b`, when `a` is `'?'`, or when `b` is `'?'`. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases where `a` or `b` can be either a lowercase Latin letter or `'?'`. There are no missing functionalities as the provided code covers all specified conditions.**
