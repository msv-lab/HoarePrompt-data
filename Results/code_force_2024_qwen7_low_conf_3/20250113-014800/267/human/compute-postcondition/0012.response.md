According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. The loop runs as long as `l` is less than `n - 2 * d`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks
- `n` is greater than 2
- `max_length` is 2
- `d` is 1
- `count` equals 1 (and no changes were made to the other variables because `count == d`)

The loop will run as long as `l < n - 2 * d`. Given that `d` is 1, `n - 2 * d` simplifies to `n - 2`.

Since `n` is greater than 2, `n - 2` will be greater than 0. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified, but we know it's greater than 2. Let's denote the current value of `l` as `l_current`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n - 2`. If `l_current` is less than `n - 2`, then `l` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Therefore, if `l_current` is less than `n - 2`, the next value of `l` will be `l_current + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1, `count` equals 1, and `l` must be less than `n - 2`**
