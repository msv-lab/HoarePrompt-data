The code `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` decrements `count` by the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`. Here, `s[l - 1]` and `s[l - 1 + d]` are two characters from the string `s`. Since `d` is 1, `s[l - 1 + d]` is equivalent to `s[l]`.

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `max_length` is 0 (unchanged).
- `d` is 1 (unchanged).
- `count` is updated based on the characters at positions `i` and `i + 1` for every valid `i`.
- The current value of `l` is greater than 0 (unchanged).

The only change is in the `count` variable, which is now decreased by the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l])`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 0, `d` is 1, `count` is decreased by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l])`, the current value of `l` is greater than 0.**
