Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is `k + 2` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), `count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, and `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`. Since the if condition `count == d` is the only one provided and there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the condition evaluation.***
