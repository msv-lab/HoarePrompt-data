Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, and `l` is 0. If `l` is greater than 0, `count` is updated to the old count minus `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` plus `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. Otherwise, the value of `count` remains unchanged.***
