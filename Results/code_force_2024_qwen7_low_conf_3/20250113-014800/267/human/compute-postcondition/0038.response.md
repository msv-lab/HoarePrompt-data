Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is 1, and `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[0], s[d]) + func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])` if `l > 0`. Since `l` is 1, this update always occurs.***
