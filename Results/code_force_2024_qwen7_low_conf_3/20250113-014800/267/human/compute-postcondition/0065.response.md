Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`.
   - `l` is `k + 2` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration).
   - `count` is increased by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.
   - `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
   ```

3. Let's break down what this line does:
   - `count` is decreased by the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.
   - This means `count` now holds the value of its previous value minus the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.

Given these points, the updated values of the variables after executing the code are:
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `d` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `count` is now `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.
- `max_length` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is `k + 2` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), `count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, and `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`.**
