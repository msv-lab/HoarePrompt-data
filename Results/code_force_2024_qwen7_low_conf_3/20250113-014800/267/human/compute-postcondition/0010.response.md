`max_length` is assigned the maximum value between `max_length` and `2 * d`. Given the initial state, `max_length` is 0 and `d` is 1, so `2 * d` is 2. Therefore, `max_length` is updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1, `count` equals 1.**
