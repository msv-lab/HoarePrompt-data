Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), `count` is increased by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, and `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`.*** 

This postcondition covers both cases of the if-else block. If the condition `count == d` is true, then `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`. If the condition is false, then the value of `max_length` remains unchanged from its previous state.
