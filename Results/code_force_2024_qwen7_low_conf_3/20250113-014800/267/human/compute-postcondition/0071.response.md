Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` found during the loop's execution where `count == d`, `d` is the last value of `d` used in the loop, `count` is the final value of `count` after all iterations of the loop have finished. If the loop does not execute, then `max_length` remains 0, `d` is `n // 2 + 1`, and `count` remains its initial value 0.**
