According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than `n - 2 * d`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were observed:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks
- `n` is at least 1
- `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`
- `l` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration)
- `count` is increased by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`
- `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold true:

1. `l` must be less than `n - 2 * d`
2. Since `l` was `k + 1` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `l` will be `k + 2`
3. `n - 2 * (d + 1)` must still be greater than 0 to ensure the loop continues.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `l` increases by 1, so it becomes `k + 2`
- `count` will be updated based on the function `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, but we don't know the exact value yet.
- `max_length` will be updated based on the previous value and `2 * d`, but the exact new value isn't specified here either.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is `k + 2` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), `count` is increased by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, and `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`**
