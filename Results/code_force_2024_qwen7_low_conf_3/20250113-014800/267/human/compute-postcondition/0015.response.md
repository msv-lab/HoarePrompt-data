Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1. If `l > 0`, then `count` is updated to `1 - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l]) + func_2(s[l], s[l + 1])`. Since there is no else part, the value of `count` remains unchanged if `l <= 0`.***
