Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and returns the length of the longest matching substring found in `s` where a character or a `?` matches the corresponding character at an offset of `sub_len` positions ahead. The function iterates over possible offsets (`sub_len`) starting from half the length of `s` down to 1, checking substrings of decreasing lengths to find the longest matching pattern. If no matching substring is found for a given offset, the function continues to check smaller offsets. The final result is the length of the longest such matching substring found. Potential edge cases include strings with only question marks or very short strings.**

**Note:** The annotations suggest that `sub_len` will eventually reach 1, but the code does not explicitly ensure this in every iteration. Therefore, the function will always check for the longest matching substring starting from half the length of `s` down to 1, ensuring that even the smallest possible offset is checked. This covers all potential cases within the given constraints.
