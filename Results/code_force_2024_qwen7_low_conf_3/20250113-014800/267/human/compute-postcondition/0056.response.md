The code updates the `max_length` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `max_length` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `2 * d`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is a non-negative integer, `count` is equal to `d` after updating it by adding the value returned by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its original value after subtracting the value returned by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` if `l` is greater than 0. Otherwise, no changes occur; `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`.**
