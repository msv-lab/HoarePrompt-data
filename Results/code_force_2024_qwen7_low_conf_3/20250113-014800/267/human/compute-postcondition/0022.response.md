The code snippet updates the `max_length` variable to be the maximum of its current value (`max_length`) and `2 * d`. Given the initial state:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks
- `n` is greater than 2
- `max_length` is 2
- `d` is 1
- `count` is updated based on the condition provided

After executing the line of code `max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)`, we calculate the new value of `max_length`:

- The current value of `max_length` is 2.
- The value of `2 * d` is `2 * 1 = 2`.

Since both values are equal, `max_length` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1, and `count` is updated as follows: if `l > 0`, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` and adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. If `l <= 0`, `count` remains unchanged.**
