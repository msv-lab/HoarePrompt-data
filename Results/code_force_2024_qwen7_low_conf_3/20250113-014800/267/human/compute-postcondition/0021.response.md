Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1, and `count` is updated as follows: if `l > 0`, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` and adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. If `l <= 0`, `count` remains unchanged.***
