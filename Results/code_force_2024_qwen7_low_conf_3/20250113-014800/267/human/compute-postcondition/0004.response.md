According to the code, the loop `for l in range(n - 2 * d):` will execute as long as `n - 2 * d` is at least 1. This is because the `range` function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to but not including the given endpoint. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n - 2 * d` must be greater than 0.

Let's break down the initial states and determine what needs to be adjusted:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `max_length` is 0 (this value will be updated within the loop).
- `d` is 1.
- `count` is updated based on the characters at positions `i` and `i + 1` for every valid `i`.

For the loop to execute, `n - 2 * d` must be greater than 0. Given that `d` is 1, the condition becomes `n - 2 > 0`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 2. The other states (`s`, `max_length`, and `count`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition and can remain as given.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be greater than 2, `max_length` is 0, `d` is 1, `count` is updated based on the characters at positions `i` and `i + 1` for every valid `i`**
