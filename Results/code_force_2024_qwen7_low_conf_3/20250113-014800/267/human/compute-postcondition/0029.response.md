The code snippet `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` updates the variable `count` by subtracting the result of the function `func_2` applied to the characters `s[l - 1]` and `s[l - 1 + d]` from `count`. However, the function `func_2` and its implementation are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical change to `count`. 

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `d`, and `l`) are not affected.

Output State: **`count` is decreased by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is greater than 0.**
