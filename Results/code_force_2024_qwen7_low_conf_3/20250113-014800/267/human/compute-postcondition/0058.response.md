According to the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to analyze how the variables change during each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`.
   - `l` is a non-negative integer.
   - `count` is updated based on certain conditions.
   - `max_length` is updated based on certain conditions.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `l = 0` to `l = n - 2 * d - 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `l` is greater than 0, `count` is updated to be `count` plus the value returned by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` minus the value returned by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.
   - If `l` is not greater than 0, `count` remains unchanged.
   - `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d` if `count == d`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`.
- `l` is a non-negative integer, let's assume it was `l = k` in the previous iteration.
- `count` has been updated based on the previous value of `l`.
- `max_length` has been updated based on the previous value of `l` and `count`.

### For the Next Iteration:
- The loop will run with `l` incremented by 1, so the new value of `l` will be `k + 1`.
- The condition `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0` must still hold.
- `count` will be updated according to the new value of `l`:
  - If `k + 1 > 0`, `count` will be updated to include the values of `func_2(s[k + d], s[k + 2 * d])` and subtract `func_2(s[k], s[k + d])`.
  - If `k + 1 <= 0`, `count` remains unchanged.
- `max_length` will be updated if `count == d` and `2 * d` is greater than the current `max_length`.

### Updated States:
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `d` remains unchanged.
- `l` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `l` is `k + 1`.
- `count` will be updated as per the conditions.
- `max_length` will be updated if `count == d` and `2 * d` is greater than the current `max_length`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is a non-negative integer and equals `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), `count` is updated based on the previous value of `l` and the new value of `l`, and `max_length` is updated if `count == d` and `2 * d` is greater than the current `max_length`.**
