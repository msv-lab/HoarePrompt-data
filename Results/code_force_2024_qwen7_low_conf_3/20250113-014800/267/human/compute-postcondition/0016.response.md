The code updates `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value (`2`) and `2 * d`. Given that `d` is initially `1`, `2 * d` equals `2`. Therefore, `max_length` remains `2` because it is already at its maximum value.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1.**
