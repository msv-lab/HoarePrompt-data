`count` is updated by adding the value returned by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. Since `l` is 1, the code effectively calls `func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`.
- `l` is 1.
- `count` is `count - func_2(s[0], s[d])`.

After executing the line `count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`:
- `count` becomes `count - func_2(s[0], s[d]) + func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is 1, `count` is `count - func_2(s[0], s[d]) + func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])**.
