The code updates the value of `count` by adding the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. The function `func_2` is applied to two characters from the string `s` based on the indices `l + d - 1` and `l + 2 * d - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

To determine the specific impact, let's break it down:

- `count` is updated by adding the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.
- The value of `l` is such that `l` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), indicating that `l` has been incremented.
- The value of `n`, `d`, and `max_length` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `count` is increased by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.
- `l` is updated to `k + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is `k + 1`, `count` is increased by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, and `max_length` remains unchanged.**
