Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is a non-negative integer. If `l` is greater than 0, `count` is updated to be `count` plus the value returned by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` minus the value returned by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`. If `l` is not greater than 0, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d` if `count == d`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
