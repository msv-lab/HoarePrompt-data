Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial values:**
   - The loop variable `l` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until `l < n - 2 * d`.
   - The initial state mentions that `n` is at least 1, but we need to determine the specific value of `d`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l < n - 2 * d`.
   - This means that for the loop to execute, `n - 2 * d` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the initial values needed:**
   - We know `n` is at least 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n - 2 * d > 0` to guarantee the loop executes.
   - Additionally, since the loop variable `l` starts from 0, we need to ensure `l` meets the loop condition initially, which is always true if `n - 2 * d > 0`.

4. **Consider the function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2(s[i], s[i + 2])` updates `count` for `i` in the range of 0 to 1.
   - However, this does not affect the loop execution directly.

5. **State adjustments needed:**
   - Ensure `n` and `d` are such that `n - 2 * d > 0`.
   - `s` remains a string of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - No changes are needed for `count` as it is updated inside the loop.

Given the above points, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` must be an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, and `l` is 0.**

This ensures the loop condition `l < n - 2 * d` is met at the start, allowing the loop to execute.
