The initial state is that `count` is decreased by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`. The string `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, and `l` is greater than 0.

The code snippet updates `count` by adding the value of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `count` was previously decreased by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.
- Now, `count` is increased by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.

Therefore, the net change in `count` is the sum of these two changes:
- Initial decrease: `-func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`
- New increase: `+func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`

So, the new value of `count` is:
\[ \text{new count} = \text{old count} - \text{func\_2}(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + \text{func\_2}(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1]) \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is equal to the old count minus `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` plus `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is greater than 0.**
