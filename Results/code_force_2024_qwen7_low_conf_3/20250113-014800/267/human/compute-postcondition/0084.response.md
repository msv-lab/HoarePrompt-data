The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` satisfies 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The function returns `max_len`, which is the length of the longest matching substring found in `s` where a character or a '?' matches the corresponding character at an offset of `sub_len` positions ahead.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return the length of the longest matching substring according to the specified conditions.
