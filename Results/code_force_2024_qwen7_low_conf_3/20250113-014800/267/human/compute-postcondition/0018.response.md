Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `max_length` is 2.
   - `d` is 1.
   - `count` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `l` from `0` to `n - 2 * d`.
   - Given `d` is 1, the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` remains unchanged (still a string of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks).
   - `n` is still greater than 2.
   - `max_length` remains 2.
   - `d` remains 1.
   - `count` remains unchanged (no modification was made to `count`).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l < n - 2 * d` must still hold true.
   - Since `d` is 1, the loop continues as long as `l < n - 2`.
   - To allow the loop to run one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `l < n - 2` must still be true.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains greater than 2.
   - `max_length` remains 2.
   - `d` remains 1.
   - `count` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1, and `count` remains unchanged.**
