The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we are currently in. However, the problem statement does not specify what loop or if statement the `break` is inside, but based on the context, it seems like the `break` statement is outside the provided code snippet, affecting the overall flow of the program.

Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and `sub_len`.
- `sub_len` is calculated as `len(s) // 2 - 2` and is less than the length of `s`.
- The code snippet ends with a `break` statement, which implies we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement.

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `max_len`, `sub_len`, `i`, `match_count`, or `s`. It only affects the control flow by exiting the loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`total` is 0; `s` is a string with a length of at least 4; `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and `len(s) // 2 - 2`; `match_count` is either 1 or 2; `sub_len` is `len(s) // 2 - 2` and is less than the length of `s`; `i` is 2.**
