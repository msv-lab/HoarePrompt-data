The code `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` impacts the `count` variable by subtracting the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from it. Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`.
- `l` is 1.
- `count` remains unchanged.

The specific values of `s`, `n`, `d`, and `l` are known, so we can proceed as follows:
- `l` is 1, so `s[l - 1]` is equivalent to `s[0]`.
- `s[l - 1 + d]` translates to `s[d]`.

Since the exact value of `d` is not specified, let's denote `s[0]` as `char_0` and `s[d]` as `char_d`. The function `func_2(char_0, char_d)` returns some value, which we will denote as `result_2`. Thus, the `count` variable is updated to `count - result_2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is 1, `count` is `count - func_2(s[0], s[d])`.**
