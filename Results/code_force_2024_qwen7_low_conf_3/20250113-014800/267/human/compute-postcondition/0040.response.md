Postcondition: ***`max_length` is updated to max(`max_length`, `2 * d`), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is 1, and `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[0], s[d]) + func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])`. Since the condition `count == d` must hold for the if part, the overall postcondition is that `max_length` is updated to max(`max_length`, `2 * d`).***
