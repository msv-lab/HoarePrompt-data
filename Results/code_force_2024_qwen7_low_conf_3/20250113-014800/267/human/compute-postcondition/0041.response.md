To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to continue.

### Given Information:
- `max_length` is updated to `max(max_length, 2 * d)`.
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`.
- `l` is 1.
- `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[0], s[d]) + func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs as long as `l < n - 2 * d`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `max_length` is updated to `max(max_length, 2 * d)`.
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 0`.
- `l` is 1 (after the previous iteration, it would be incremented by 1).
- `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[0], s[d]) + func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Incrementing `l`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `l` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `l` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Checking the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `l < n - 2 * d`. At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `1 < n - 2 * d` must still hold true. This means `n - 2 * d` must remain greater than 1.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `max_length` remains unchanged since no additional updates are mentioned for this variable in the loop body.
   - `s` remains unchanged since no modifications to `s` are mentioned in the loop body.
   - `n` remains unchanged since no modifications to `n` are mentioned in the loop body.
   - `d` remains unchanged since no modifications to `d` are mentioned in the loop body.
   - `l` is incremented to 2.
   - `count` remains unchanged from its last update.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `max_length` is updated to `max(max_length, 2 * d)`.
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 1`.
- `l` is 2.
- `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[0], s[d]) + func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])`.

### Answer:
State: **`max_length` is updated to max(`max_length`, `2 * d`), `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * d > 1`, `l` is 2, and `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[0], s[d]) + func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])**.
