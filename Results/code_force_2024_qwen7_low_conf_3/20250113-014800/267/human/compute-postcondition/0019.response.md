`count` is decremented by the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`. The values of `s`, `n`, `max_length`, `d`, and `l` are not specified, so they remain unchanged. The exact value of `count` after decrementing depends on the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, which is not defined in the provided code.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2, `max_length` is 2, `d` is 1, `count` is decreased by `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`**
