The code updates the value of `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. Since `d` is an integer and `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, it means `d` is a valid integer that satisfies this condition. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `count`, `l`) remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least 1, `d` is an integer such that `n - 2 * (d + 1) > 0`, `l` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `l` in the previous iteration), `count` is increased by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `2 * d`.**
