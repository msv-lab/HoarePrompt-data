Postcondition: ***`total` is 0; `s` is a string with a length of at least 4; `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and `len(s) // 2 - 2`; `match_count` is either 1 or 2; `sub_len` is `len(s) // 2 - 2` and is less than the length of `s`; `i` is 2. If `match_count` equals `sub_len`, the condition remains as is. Since there is no else part, the values of `total`, `s`, `max_len`, `match_count`, `sub_len`, and `i` do not change regardless of the condition evaluation.***
