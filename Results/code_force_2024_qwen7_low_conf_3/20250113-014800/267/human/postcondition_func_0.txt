The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a maximum length of 5000. It iterates through possible values of `d` (from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`), where `n` is the length of `s`. For each `d`, it calculates `count` as the number of pairs of characters at positions `i` and `i + d` that satisfy a condition defined in `func_2`. It then updates `max_length` to be the maximum value of `2 * d` where `count == d`. If no such `d` is found, `max_length` remains 0. After the loop, the function returns `max_length`. This means that the function finds the longest substring in `s` that can be partitioned into non-overlapping pairs of characters that satisfy the condition in `func_2`, and returns twice the number of such pairs. If no valid partitioning exists, it returns 0.
