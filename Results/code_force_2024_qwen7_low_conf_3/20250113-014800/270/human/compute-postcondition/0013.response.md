`pc, u` are assigned the values popped from `q`. Since `q` is a list, the last element of `q` is popped and unpacked into `pc` and `u`. The last element of `q` is `(1, u)` because `q` was constructed as `q[:-1] + [(1, u)] + [(0, v) for v in u]`. Therefore, `pc` gets the value `1` and `u` gets the value `u`.

The initial state was:
- `pc` is 0
- `u` is `u[:-1]`
- `q` is `q[:-1] + [(1, u)] + [(0, v) for v in u]`
- `s` is `[ '(' ]`
- `q` must be non-empty

After popping, the new state is:
- `pc` is now `1`
- `u` remains as `u[:-1]`
- `q` is now `q[:-1] + [(0, v) for v in u]`
- `s` is `[ '(' ]`
- `q` is still non-empty

Output State: **`pc` is 1, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1] + [(0, v) for v in u]`, `s` is `[ '(' ]`, `q` is non-empty**
