Let's go through the code step by step:

- Initial State: `pc` is 1, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1] + [(0, v) for v in u]`, `s` is `[ '(', '(' ]`

The code snippet `q.append((1, u))` will add the tuple `(1, u)` to the list `q`.

First, let's determine what `u` and `q` look like based on the initial state.

- `u` is `u[:-1]`, which means `u` is the list `u` without its last element.
- `q` is `q[:-1] + [(0, v) for v in u]`, which means `q` is the list `q` without its last element, plus a list of tuples where each tuple is `(0, v)` and `v` is an element from the original `u`.

Given the initial state of `s` being `[ '(', '(' ]`, it doesn't directly affect the other variables, so we focus on `u` and `q`.

Let's assume `u` was originally `['a', 'b', 'c']`. Then `u[:-1]` would be `['a', 'b']`.

And `q` would be `q[:-1] + [('0', 'a'), ('0', 'b')]`.

Now, appending `(1, u)` to `q` means we add the tuple `(1, ['a', 'b'])` to `q`.

So, the new state of `q` would be `q[:-1] + [('0', 'a'), ('0', 'b'), (1, ['a', 'b'])]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `pc` is 1
- `u` is `u[:-1]`
- `q` is `q[:-1] + [(0, v) for v in u] + [(1, u)]`
- `s` remains `[ '(', '(' ]`

Output State: **`pc` is 1, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1] + [(0, v) for v in u] + [(1, u)]`, `s` is `[ '(', '(' ]`**
