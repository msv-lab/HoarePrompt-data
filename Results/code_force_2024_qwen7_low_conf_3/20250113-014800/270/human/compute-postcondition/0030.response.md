The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `u`. `u` is a string consisting only of characters '(' and ')', and `u` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns an empty string since `u` is an empty string and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence constructed from `u`, which is also empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `u`, which is a string consisting only of characters '(' and ')'. If `u` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string.**
