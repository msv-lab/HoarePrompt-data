Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `pc` is 0
   - `u` is `u[:-1]` (which means `u` is now a list that excludes the last element)
   - `q` is `q[:-1] + [(1, u)]` (which means `q` is a list excluding the last element and appending a tuple `(1, u)` to it)
   - `s` is `[ '(' ]` (a list containing a single string ` '(' `)

2. Code Execution:
   - `q.extend((0, v) for v in u)`
     - This line extends the list `q` by adding tuples of the form `(0, v)` for each element `v` in the list `u`.
     - Since `u` is a list excluding its last element, let's denote the elements of `u` as `u_1, u_2, ..., u_{n-1}` (where `n` is the length of `u`).

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `pc` remains unchanged, so it is still 0.
   - `u` remains unchanged as it was already modified to exclude its last element.
   - `q` is extended by adding tuples `(0, u_i)` for each `u_i` in `u`. The previous elements of `q` are also retained.
   - `s` remains unchanged.

4. Updated Values:
   - `q` will now include the previously existing elements, plus the tuples `(0, u_i)` for each `u_i` in `u`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `pc` is 0
- `u` is `u[:-1]`
- `q` is `q[:-1] + [(1, u)] + [(0, v) for v in u]`
- `s` is `[ '(' ]`

Output State: **`pc` is 0, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1] + [(1, u)] + [(0, v) for v in u]`, `s` is `[ '(' ]`**
