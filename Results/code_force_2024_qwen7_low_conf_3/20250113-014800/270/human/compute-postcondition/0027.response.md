Postcondition: ***`pc` is `(a, b)`, `u` is `(0, c)`, `q` is `element_2_of_q, ..., (1, (1, (0, c))), (0, 0), (0, c)`, and `s` is `['(', '(', ')', '(', ')']`. Since the if condition `pc == 1` is the only condition considered, and there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
