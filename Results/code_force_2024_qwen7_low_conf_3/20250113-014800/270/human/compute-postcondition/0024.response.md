The code snippet `q.extend((0, v) for v in u)` extends the list `q` by adding tuples `(0, v)` for each element `v` in `u`. 

Let's break down the steps:

1. Initial State:
   - `pc` is `(a, b)`
   - `u` is `(0, c)`
   - `q` is updated to include the original elements of `q` except the first one, followed by tuples `(0, v)` for each `v` in `u`, and the tuple `(1, (1, u))`
   - `s` is `['(', '(', ')', '(']`

2. After the initial update to `q`:
   - `q` is now `(element_2_of_q, ..., (1, (1, (0, c))))` (assuming the original elements except the first one are `element_2_of_q, ..., (1, (1, (0, c)))`)

3. The code `q.extend((0, v) for v in u)` will extend `q` by adding `(0, 0)` and `(0, c)` since `u` is `(0, c)`.

Therefore, the updated `q` will be:
- Original elements of `q` except the first one: `element_2_of_q, ..., (1, (1, (0, c)))`
- Added tuples from `u`: `(0, 0)` and `(0, c)`

The output state is:
Output State: **`pc` is `(a, b)`, `u` is `(0, c)`, `q` is `element_2_of_q, ..., (1, (1, (0, c))), (0, 0), (0, c)`, `s` is `['(', '(', ')', '(']`**
