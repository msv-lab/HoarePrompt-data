Functionality: **The function processes an input string `s` which is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence and reconstructs it into a new balanced parentheses sequence. It starts by computing a prefix sum array to track the balance of parentheses up to each position. Then, it sorts these prefix sums along with their indices. Finally, it iterates through the sorted list to construct the result by ensuring that no nested groups of parentheses are formed incorrectly. The function returns the fully reconstructed balanced parentheses sequence as a string. Potential edge cases include empty strings or invalid input sequences, though the function handles non-empty balanced sequences as described.**
