Postcondition: ***`pc` is 0, `u` is a list without its last element, `q` is updated to include the original elements of `q` except the first one, followed by tuples `(0, v)` for each `v` in `u`, and the tuple `(1, u)`, `s` is `['(', '(', ')']`, and `q` is non-empty.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and there is no additional change to the variables when the condition `pc == 1` is false, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition and the if part's postcondition.
