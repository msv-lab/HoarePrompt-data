Postcondition: ***`pc` is `(a, b)`, `u` is `(0, c)`, `q` is `element_2_of_q, ..., (1, (1, (0, c))), (0, 0), (0, c)`, and `s` is `['(', '(', ')', '(']`. This holds true regardless of whether `pc == 0` evaluates to true or false since there is no else part and the if part already covers all possibilities related to the given preconditions.***
