The code `q.append((1, u))` appends a tuple `(1, u)` to the list `q`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `pc` remains unchanged at 0.
- `u` is updated to `u[:-1]`, meaning `u` loses its last character.
- `q` is updated by appending `(1, u)` to it, so `q` now contains the elements from its previous state plus `(1, u)`.
- `s` remains unchanged as `[ '(' ]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`pc` is 0, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1] + [(1, u)]`, `s` is `[ '(' ]`**
