Postcondition: ***`pc` is 0, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1] + [(1, u)] + [(0, v) for v in u]`, `s` is `[ '(' ]`*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we only consider the if part. The if condition is `pc == 0`, and the postcondition for this case is provided directly. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains as the postcondition from the if part.
