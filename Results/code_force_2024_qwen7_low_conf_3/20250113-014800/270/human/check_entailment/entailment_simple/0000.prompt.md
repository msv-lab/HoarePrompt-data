You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The only difference with the medium version is the maximum length of the
input.

A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced
parentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will
omit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of
two different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore
the balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced
parentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Find its preimage: the balanced
parentheses sequence the balanced shuffle of which is equal to the given
sequence.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the balanced parentheses sequence t such that the balanced shuffle of t
is equal to s . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists and is unique.

Example

Input

    ()(()())
    
Output

    (()(()))
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
s = input()
q = [[]]
it = iter(q)
cur = next(it)
for c in s:
    if c == '(':
        x = []
        cur.append(x)
        q.append(x)
    if c == ')':
        cur = next(it)
print(func_1(q[0]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is a string consisting only of characters '(' and ')', and u is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(u):
    q = [(0, v) for v in u]
    s = []
    while q:
        pc, u = q.pop()
        
        if pc == 0:
            s.append('(')
            q.append((1, u))
            q.extend((0, v) for v in u)
        
        if pc == 1:
            s.append(')')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `pc` is 1, `u` is an empty string, `q` is an empty list, `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence constructed from the original string `u`
    return ''.join(s)
    #The program returns an empty string since 'u' is an empty string and 's' is a balanced parentheses sequence constructed from 'u', which is also empty

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
