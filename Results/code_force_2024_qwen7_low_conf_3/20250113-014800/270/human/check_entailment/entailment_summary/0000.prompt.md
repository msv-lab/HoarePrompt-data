You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
The only difference with the medium version is the maximum length of the
input.

A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced
parentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will
omit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of
two different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore
the balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced
parentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Find its preimage: the balanced
parentheses sequence the balanced shuffle of which is equal to the given
sequence.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the balanced parentheses sequence t such that the balanced shuffle of t
is equal to s . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists and is unique.

Example

Input

    ()(()())
    
Output

    (()(()))

# Program:
s = input()
q = [[]]
it = iter(q)
cur = next(it)
for c in s:
    if c == '(':
        x = []
        cur.append(x)
        q.append(x)
    if c == ')':
        cur = next(it)
print(func_1(q[0]))

def func_1(u):
    q = [(0, v) for v in u]
    s = []
    while q:
        (pc, u) = q.pop()
        if pc == 0:
            s.append('(')
            q.append((1, u))
            q.extend(((0, v) for v in u))
        if pc == 1:
            s.append(')')
    return ''.join(s)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `u`, which is a string consisting only of characters `'('` and `')'`. It constructs a balanced parentheses sequence from `u` by manipulating a stack `s` and a queue `q`. After processing, the function returns the balanced parentheses sequence as a string. 

- If `u` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string.
- For non-empty strings, the function processes each character in `u` to ensure the resulting sequence in `s` is balanced. Specifically, it uses a stack `s` to store opening parentheses and a queue `q` to manage the parsing process.
- The function ensures that every opening parenthesis `'('` is matched with a corresponding closing parenthesis `')'` in the correct order.
- The function handles all valid balanced parentheses sequences up to a length of 500,000 characters, including edge cases where `u` might already be a balanced sequence or contain unbalanced parts that can be corrected through the parsing process.
