Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input and is not divisible by 3, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` equals `a + b // 3 + 1` if `c >= 2`, and `c - 2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `c < 2`, then `tents` equals `a`, the current value of `b` is such that `b % 3` equals 1, and `c` is less than 2.***
