Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3` unless `c` is greater than or equal to 1, in which case `tents` is `a + b // 3 + 1`. Additionally, if `c` is less than 1, the function prints `-1`.***
