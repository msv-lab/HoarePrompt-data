The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` and does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `tents`. Since the condition for printing `-1` (when `c < 1`) is already met before the print statement is executed, the print statement will execute as expected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3` unless `c` is greater than or equal to 1, in which case `tents` is `a + b // 3 + 1`; the program prints `-1`.**
