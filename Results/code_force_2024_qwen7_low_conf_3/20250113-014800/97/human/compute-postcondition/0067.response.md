Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input. If `c` is greater than or equal to 1, `tents` is equal to `a + (b // 3 + 1)` and `c` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a` and -1 is printed.***
