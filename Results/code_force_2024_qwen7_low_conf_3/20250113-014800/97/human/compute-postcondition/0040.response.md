The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this scenario, there is no loop present, and the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The only thing that happens is the print statement outputs `-1`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`; print statement outputs `-1`.**
