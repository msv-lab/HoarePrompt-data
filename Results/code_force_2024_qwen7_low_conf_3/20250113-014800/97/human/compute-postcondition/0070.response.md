Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input. Depending on the condition, `tents` is either equal to `a + (b // 3)` or `a + (b // 3 + 1)`. If `c` is greater than or equal to 2, `tents` is updated to `a + (b // 3 + 1)` and `c` is decremented by 1. If `c` is exactly 1, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a` and no further changes occur.***
