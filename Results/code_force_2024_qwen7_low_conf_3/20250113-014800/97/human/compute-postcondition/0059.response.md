`c` is decremented by 2. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` being integers from input, and `c` being an integer from input, along with `tents` being equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`, remains unchanged except for `c`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input decreased by 2; `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`.**
