The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console and does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input and is not divisible by 3, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` equals `a`, the current value of `b` is such that `b % 3` equals 1, and `c` is less than 2**
