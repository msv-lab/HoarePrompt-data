`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the user will input three integers, which will be assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input**
