The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The `print output is -1` line does not affect any variables either.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`; print output is -1**
