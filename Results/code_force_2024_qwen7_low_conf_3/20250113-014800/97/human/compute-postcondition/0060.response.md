The code prints `-1` but does not affect any of the variables. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `tents` retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`; print output is -1**
