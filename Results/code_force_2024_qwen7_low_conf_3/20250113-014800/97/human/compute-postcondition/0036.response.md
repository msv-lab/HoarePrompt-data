`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`. The code `tents += b // 3` updates the value of `tents` by adding the integer division of `b` by 3 to its current value. The integer division `b // 3` results in the quotient of `b` divided by 3, discarding the remainder.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3`.**
