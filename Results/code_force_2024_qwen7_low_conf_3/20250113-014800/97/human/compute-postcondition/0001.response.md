According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` being an integer input by the user and `a`, `b`, and `c` being non-negative integers does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer**
