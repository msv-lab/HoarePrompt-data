Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, and `tents` is either `a + (b // 3)` or `a + (b // 3 + 1)` adjusted by the value of `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)`. If `c` is exactly 1, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, `tents` remains as adjusted and `c` is decremented by 1 if `c` is greater than or equal to 2.***
