Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input. If `c` is greater than or equal to 2, `tents` is set to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2. Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a` and the program prints `-1`.***
