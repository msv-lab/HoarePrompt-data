Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input and is not divisible by 3, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` is updated as follows: 
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, then `tents = a + b // 3 + 1` and `c = c - 2`.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, then `tents = a` and `c` remains unchanged.
- If `b % 3 != 1`, then `tents` remains unchanged and `c` is reduced by 1 if `c >= 1`. If `c < 1`, the printed value is -1.***
