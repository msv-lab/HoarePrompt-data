`c` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `c` is greater than or equal to 1, so after decrementing, `c` will still be a non-negative integer but now specifically one less than its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is one less than its initial value (but still >= 0), `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`, `b` is not divisible by 3, and the current value of `b` modulo 3 is 2.**
