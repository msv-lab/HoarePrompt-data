Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - `c` is an integer from the input.
   - If `c < 1`, then `tents` is `-1` and `-1` is printed.
   - Otherwise, `tents` is calculated as `a + b // 3 + 1 + (c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0))` and this value is printed.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs `t` times.

3. **Iteration Process**:
   - For each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
   - If `t` becomes 0, the loop terminates.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `t` has been decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `t` is now `t - 1`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `t` is used as the loop counter and must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, after the previous iteration, `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration**:
   - `t` is now `t - 1`.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same.
   - `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input**
