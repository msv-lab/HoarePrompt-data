The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is read, the value of `t` becomes the integer entered by the user, while the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer.**
