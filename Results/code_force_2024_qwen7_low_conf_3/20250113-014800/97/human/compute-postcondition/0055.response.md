`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is expected to be three integers separated by spaces. The initial values of `t` and the integer inputs remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input**
