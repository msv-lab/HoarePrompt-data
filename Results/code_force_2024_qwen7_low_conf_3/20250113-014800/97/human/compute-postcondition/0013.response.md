The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables and simply continues to the next line after the statement. 

Given the initial conditions and the fact that the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input and is not divisible by 3, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` equals `a`, the current value of `b` is such that `b % 3` equals 1, and `c` is less than 2**
