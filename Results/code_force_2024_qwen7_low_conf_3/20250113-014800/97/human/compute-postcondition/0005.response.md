`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` is equal to `a`. The current value of `b` is divisible by 3. The code `tents += b // 3` increments the value of `tents` by the integer division of `b` by 3. Since `b` is divisible by 3, `b // 3` is an integer.

Therefore, the new value of `tents` is `a + (b // 3)`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` is equal to `a + (b // 3)`.**
