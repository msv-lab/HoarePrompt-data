The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1`. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `tents`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the printed value.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`; -1 is printed.**
