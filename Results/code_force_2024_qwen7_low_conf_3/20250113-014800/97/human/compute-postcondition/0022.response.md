The `continue` statement in this context does not change the values of any variables or affect the conditions given. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop without terminating the loop itself. Since no variables are updated or new values are assigned, the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is not divisible by 3, and the current value of `b` modulo 3 is not less than 1; printed value is -1**
