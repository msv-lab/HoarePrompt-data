The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`; -1 is printed.**
