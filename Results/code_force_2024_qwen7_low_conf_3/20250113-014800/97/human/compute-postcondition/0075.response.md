Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is the final value of `a` after all iterations, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations, `c` is the final value of `c` after all iterations, and `tents` is the final value calculated based on the following rules:
- For each iteration, if `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3`.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, `tents` remains unchanged.
- If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- If `b % 3 != 1` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- If `c < 1` at any point, the loop terminates and `-1` is printed, setting `tents` to `-1`.
- If the loop completes without printing `-1`, `tents` is printed and is the final value calculated.**
