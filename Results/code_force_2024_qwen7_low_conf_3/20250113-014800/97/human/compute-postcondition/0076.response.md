The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Each test case consists of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively, such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).

Case_1: The function returns the result of processing the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` according to the given constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `t` is a positive integer within a specific range and `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers, and return a result based on these inputs.
