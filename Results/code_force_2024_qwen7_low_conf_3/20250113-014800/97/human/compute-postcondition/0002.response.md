The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions are that `t` must be greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers. After executing this line of code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated to the integers input by the user, while `t` remains unchanged because no operation involving `t` was performed.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input**
