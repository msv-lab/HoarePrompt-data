The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop is present in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`; print output is `-1`**
