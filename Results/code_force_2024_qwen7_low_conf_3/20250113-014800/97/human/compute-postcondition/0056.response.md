`tents` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`**
