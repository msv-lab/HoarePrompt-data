`c` is decremented by 1. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `tents` was initially calculated as `a + (b // 3 + 1)`, and this calculation does not get re-evaluated after the decrement.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is `c - 1`; `tents` is equal to `a + (b // 3 + 1)`**
