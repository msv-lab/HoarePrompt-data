The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is not divisible by 3, and the current value of `b` modulo 3 is not less than 1; printed value is -1**
