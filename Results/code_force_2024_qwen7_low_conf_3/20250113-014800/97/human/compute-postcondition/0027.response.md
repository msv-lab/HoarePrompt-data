Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` is updated as follows: if `c >= 0`, then `tents` is updated according to the rules provided, and `c` is reduced by 1 if `c >= 1` and `b % 3 != 1`. Otherwise, the function prints `-1` and does not change `t`, `a`, `b`, or `tents`. The current value of `c` is 0 or more.***
