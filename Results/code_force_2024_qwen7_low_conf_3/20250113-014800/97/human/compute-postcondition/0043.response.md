`c` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `c` was an integer from the input, so now `c` is equal to its initial value minus 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `tents`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input minus 1; `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`**
