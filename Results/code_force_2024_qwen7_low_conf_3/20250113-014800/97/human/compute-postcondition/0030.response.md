Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` is updated as follows: - If `b % 3 == 0`, then `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3)`. - If `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, then `tents = a` and `c` remains unchanged. - If `b % 3 != 1`, then `tents` remains unchanged and `c` is reduced by 1 if `c >= 1`. If `c < 1`, the function does not change `t`, `a`, `b`, or `tents`.
