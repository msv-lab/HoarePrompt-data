The code prints `-1`, which does not affect any of the variables. The initial conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`; print output is `-1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `c` is an integer from the input; `tents` is equal to `a`; print output is `-1`**
