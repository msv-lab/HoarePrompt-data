Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `tents` is either equal to `a + b // 3 + 1` if `c >= 1` and `c` is reduced by 1, or equal to `a` with no change in `c`, `b` is not divisible by 3, and the current value of `b` modulo 3 is either 2 or not less than 1; if `c < 1`, the printed value is -1.***
