`c` is decremented by 2. The value of `a`, `b`, `tents`, and `t` remains unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `c` is `c - 2`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input and is not divisible by 3, `c` is an integer from the input and is now `c - 2`, `tents` equals `a + b // 3 + 1`, and `c - 2` is greater than or equal to 0**
