#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively, such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is the final value of `a` after all iterations, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations, `c` is the final value of `c` after all iterations, and `tents` is the final value calculated based on the following rules:
    #- For each iteration, if `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3`.
    #- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2.
    #- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, `tents` remains unchanged.
    #- If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
    #- If `b % 3 != 1` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` and `c` is decremented by 1.
    #- If `c < 1` at any point, the loop terminates and `-1` is printed, setting `tents` to `-1`.
    #- If the loop completes without printing `-1`, `tents` is printed and is the final value calculated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. It calculates a value `tents` based on the following rules:
- For each test case, if `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3`.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, the function prints `-1` and exits the current iteration.
- If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- If `b % 3 != 1` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- If `c < 1` at any point during the calculation, the function prints `-1` and exits the current iteration.
- After processing all test cases, the function prints the final value of `tents` or `-1` if any iteration resulted in `-1`.

The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, it processes the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the condition when `c < 1` by printing `-1` and exiting the current iteration.
- However, the function does not handle the case when `b % 3 == 1` and `c == 1` separately; instead, it increments `tents` by `b // 3 + 1` and decrements `c` by 2, which is incorrect if `c` is exactly 1. This should be handled by checking if `c == 1` before decrementing `c` by 2.
