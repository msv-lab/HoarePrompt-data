Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the number of tents needed with the value `a` (for introverts).
2. It handles the allocation of tents for extroverts in different cases based on whether the number of extroverts (`b`) is divisible by 3, leaves a remainder of 1, or leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.
3. For remainders of 1 and 2, it checks if there are enough universals (`c`) to fill the remaining space, otherwise, it prints `-1`.
4. Finally, it calculates the number of additional tents required for universals and prints the total number of tents.
5. The logic seems to cover all the conditions specified in the problem statement, including handling the edge case where there are no universals left when necessary.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of tents needed or output `-1` when it's impossible to accommodate all participants.

Correctness: **True**
