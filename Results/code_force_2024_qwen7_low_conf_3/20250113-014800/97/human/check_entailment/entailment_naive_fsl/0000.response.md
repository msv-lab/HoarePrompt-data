Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are more extroverts than universals in a way that leaves some extroverts without accommodation. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where there are enough universals to accommodate the extroverts but the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and no additional universals are available to make up the difference.

For example, consider the test case:
```
1 2 0
```
Here, there is 1 introvert who needs their own tent, and 2 extroverts who each need to be in a tent with 2 others. Since there are no universals, it is impossible to accommodate both extroverts. However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this scenario and will print 2 instead of -1.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the number of extroverts does not exceed the combined number of introverts and universals that can form complete groups of three. This can be achieved by checking if `b` (number of extroverts) is greater than `a + c // 2`, where `a` is the number of introverts and `c` is the number of universals. If this condition is true, the program should output -1.
