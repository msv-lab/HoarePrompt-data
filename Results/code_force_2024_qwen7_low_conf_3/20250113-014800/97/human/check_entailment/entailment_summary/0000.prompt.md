You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

def func():
    t = int(input())

        if b % 3 == 0:
            tents += b // 3
        elif b % 3 == 1:
            if c >= 2:
                tents += b // 3 + 1
                c -= 2
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue

                c -= 1
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        if c >= 0:
            tents += c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)
            print(tents)
        else:
            print(-1)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. It calculates a value `tents` based on the following rules:
- For each test case, if `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3`.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, the function prints `-1` and exits the current iteration.
- If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- If `b % 3 != 1` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- If `c < 1` at any point during the calculation, the function prints `-1` and exits the current iteration.
- After processing all test cases, the function prints the final value of `tents` or `-1` if any iteration resulted in `-1`.

The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, it processes the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the condition when `c < 1` by printing `-1` and exiting the current iteration.
- However, the function does not handle the case when `b % 3 == 1` and `c == 1` separately; instead, it increments `tents` by `b // 3 + 1` and decrements `c` by 2, which is incorrect if `c` is exactly 1. This should be handled by checking if `c == 1` before decrementing `c` by 2.
