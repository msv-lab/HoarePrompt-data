`count` is incremented by `2 * max(0, y_max - y_min + 1)`. To determine the exact value, we need to evaluate `max(0, y_max - y_min + 1)`.

Given:
- \(y_{\text{min}} = 2r - 1\)
- \(y_{\text{max}} = 4r - 1\)
- \(y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}} + 1 = (4r - 1) - (2r - 1) + 1 = 2r + 1\)

Since \(2r + 1 > 0\) for any positive integer \(r\), \(max(0, 2r + 1) = 2r + 1\).

Thus, `count` is incremented by \(2 * (2r + 1) = 4r + 2\).

The Output State is:
Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated to `count + 4r + 2`, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\), `y_min_sq` is \(2r - 1\), `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\), `y_max` is \(\left\lfloor \sqrt{4r - 1} \right\rfloor\).**
