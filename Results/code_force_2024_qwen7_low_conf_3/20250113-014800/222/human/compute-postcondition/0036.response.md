The `continue` statement in a loop is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided, we assume that the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change their values. All variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\), `y_min_sq` is \(2*r - 1\), `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\)**
