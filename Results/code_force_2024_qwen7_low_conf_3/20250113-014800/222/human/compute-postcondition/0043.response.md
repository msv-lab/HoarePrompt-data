The code updates the `count` variable by adding `y_max * 2 + 1` if `y_max` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it adds 0. The value of `y_max` is given as \(\mathit{math.floor}(\sqrt{4r - 1})\). 

Let's consider the condition for `y_max`:
- If \(4r - 1\) is a perfect square and non-negative, then `y_max` is the integer part of its square root.

Given that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), the expression \(4r - 1\) will be a positive integer for all valid values of `r`. Hence, `y_max` will be a non-negative integer.

Since `y_max` is a non-negative integer, the condition `y_max >= 0` will always be true. Therefore, the code will execute `count += y_max * 2 + 1`.

To summarize:
- `count` is incremented by `y_max * 2 + 1`, which simplifies to \(\mathit{math.floor}(\sqrt{4r - 1}) * 2 + 1\).

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated by `count += math.floor(sqrt(4r - 1)) * 2 + 1`, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\), `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\), `y_max` is \(\mathit{math.floor}(\sqrt{4r - 1})\)**
