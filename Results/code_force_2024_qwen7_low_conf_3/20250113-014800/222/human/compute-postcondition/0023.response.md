The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop specified in the code, the `continue` statement does not have any direct impact on the variables. It simply indicates that the loop would continue without executing the remaining code inside it.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)
- `count` is updated according to the given rules
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\)
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
- `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive
- `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\)
- `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\)
- `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2\)

The `continue` statement does not affect any of these variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive, `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\), `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\), `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2\)**
