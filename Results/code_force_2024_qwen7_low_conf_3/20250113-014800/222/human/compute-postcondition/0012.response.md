The code appends the string representation of `func_1(r)` to the list `results`. Here, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. Since `t` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 1, and `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(r)`, the only change is in the `results` list.

Since `r` is equal to `int(data[index])`, and `results` now includes the string representation of `func_1(r)`, the updated state of `results` will include this new string. The previous content of `results` is preserved.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 1, `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(int(data[index]))`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`**
