The value of `index` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 1 (it was already increased in the previous line), `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(r)`, and `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 1 (previously increased), `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(r)`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`**
