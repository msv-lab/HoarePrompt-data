Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `r` where `1 <= r <= 10^5`. It calculates and returns the value of `3 * r * r`, which is three times the square of `r`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function correctly computes the intended result based on the input constraint.**

Explanation: The annotated code and the return postconditions accurately describe the function's behavior. The function takes an integer `r` within the specified range and returns `3 * r * r`. Since the code directly performs this calculation without any conditional checks or additional logic, the only potential edge case would be inputs outside the specified range, but such cases are not handled by the function itself and should be managed externally.
