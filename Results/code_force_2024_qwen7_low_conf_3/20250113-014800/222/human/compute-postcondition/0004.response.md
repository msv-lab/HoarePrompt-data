The code initializes an empty list called `results`. This means that the list `results` is now populated with no elements, while the other variables (`t`, `r`, `data`, and `index`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5 for each test case, and the sum of all r values does not exceed 10^5; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a line of input; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list**
