According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1.
- `index` is increased by 1.
- `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(int(data[index]))`.
- `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration and it is decreased by 1, it means `t` is now `t - 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `t - 1 > 0`), which implies `t` must be at least 1. Additionally, `index` must be increased by 1 from its previous value, and `results` and `r` should be updated based on the new value of `index`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 1, `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(int(data[index]))`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`**
