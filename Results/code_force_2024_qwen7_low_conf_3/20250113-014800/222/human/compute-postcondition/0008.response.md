`results.append(str(func_1(r)))` appends the string representation of the result of `func_1(r)` to the list `results`. The value of `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`, and `index` is increased by 1. Since `func_1(r)` is called with `r` as an argument, the output of `func_1(r)` is converted to a string and appended to `results`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`; `index` is increased by 1; `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(r)`**
