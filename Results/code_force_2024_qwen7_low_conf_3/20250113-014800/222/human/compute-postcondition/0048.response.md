Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `r` such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\) and returns the total count of integer points \((x, y)\) within the square centered at the origin with side length \(2r+1\) and vertices on the lines \(x = -r\) and \(x = r\). Specifically, it counts points where \(x\) is in the range \([-r, r]\) and \(y\) satisfies certain conditions derived from the inequalities involving \(r\), \(r+1\), and \(x\).**

**Actions performed by the function:**
- Initializes `count` to 0.
- Iterates over all possible integer values of \(x\) in the range \([-r, r]\).
- For each \(x\), calculates `x_squared`.
- Depending on whether `x_squared` is less than \(r_squared\), calculates `y_min_sq` and `y_max_sq` and determines the corresponding `y_min` and `y_max` using square root calculations.
- Updates `count` based on the number of valid \(y\) values for each \(x\).

**Final state of the program after conclusion:**
- The function returns the integer `count`, which represents the total number of integer points satisfying the specified conditions. This count includes points where \(x\) ranges from \(-r\) to \(r\) and \(y\) values are derived from the given inequalities.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(x = 0\), the calculation of `y_min_sq` and `y_max_sq` needs to handle the case when these values are zero to avoid division by zero or incorrect floor/ceil operations.
- The function correctly handles the range of \(r\) from 1 to \(10^5\), ensuring that all possible integer values of \(x\) and corresponding \(y\) values are considered.
