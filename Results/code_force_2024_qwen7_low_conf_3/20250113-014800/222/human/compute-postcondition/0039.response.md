The code updates the value of `y_max` by taking the floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`. Given that `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\), the value of `y_max` will be the floor of the square root of \(4r - 1\).

Since `r` is an integer between \(1\) and \(10^5\), the exact value of `y_max` depends on the specific value of `r`. However, the general form of `y_max` can be expressed as:

\[ y_max = \left\lfloor \sqrt{4r - 1} \right\rfloor \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\), `y_min_sq` is \(2*r - 1\), `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\), `y_max` is \(\left\lfloor \sqrt{4r - 1} \right\rfloor\).**
