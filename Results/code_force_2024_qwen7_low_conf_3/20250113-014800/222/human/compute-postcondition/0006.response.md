`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is converted to an integer. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0; `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`**
