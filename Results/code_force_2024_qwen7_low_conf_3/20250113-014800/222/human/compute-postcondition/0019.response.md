The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func_2()`. The functionality of the function is to process test cases where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and for each test case, `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\). The values of `r` for all test cases are provided in the input, and the sum of all `r` values does not exceed \(10^5\).

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes test cases with `t` as a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000 and `r` as an integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), returning results based on the given conditions.**
