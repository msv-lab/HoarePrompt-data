Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (the number of sub-cases) and a series of integers \( r \) (each between 1 and \(10^5\)). For each sub-case, it calls the function `func_1` with \( r \) as input and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints the results in a newline-separated format. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing explicitly. Potential edge cases include when \( t \) is 0 or when the input does not follow the specified format. The function also assumes that the sum of all \( r \) values for all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).**
