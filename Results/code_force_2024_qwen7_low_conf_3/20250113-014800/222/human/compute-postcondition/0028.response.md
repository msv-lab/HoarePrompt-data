The code updates `y_max_sq` by calculating \(r \times (r + 1) - x \times (x + 1) - 1\). Let's break down the impact:

- `r_squared` remains unchanged since it was not referenced in the code.
- `r_plus_1_squared` remains unchanged since it was not referenced in the code.
- `x` remains unchanged since it was not referenced in the code.
- `x_squared` remains unchanged until the code updates it to \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\).
- `y_max_sq` is updated to \(r \times (r + 1) - x \times (x + 1) - 1\).
- `y_max` remains unchanged since it was not referenced in the code.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\).
- `count` is updated according to the given rules.
- `r_squared` is `r * r`.
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
- `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive.
- `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\).
- `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1\).
- `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\).

After executing the code:
- `y_max_sq` is updated to \(r \times (r + 1) - x \times (x + 1) - 1\).
- `x_squared` is updated to \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\).

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `count` is updated according to the given rules; `r_squared` is `r * r`; `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive; `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\); `y_max_sq` is \(r \times (r + 1) - x \times (x + 1) - 1\); `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\).**
