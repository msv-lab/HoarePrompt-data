Postcondition: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the following rules: if \(x^2 < r^2\), `count` is updated by `2 * (y_max - y_min + 1)` if \(y_max \geq y_min - 1\) or remains unchanged otherwise; otherwise, `count` is updated by adding `y_max * 2 + 1` to its current value if \(y_max\) is non-negative. `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive, `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\), `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1\), and `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\).**
