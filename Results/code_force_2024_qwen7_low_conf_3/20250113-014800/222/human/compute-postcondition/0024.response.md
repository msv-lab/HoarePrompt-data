Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive, `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\), `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\), `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2\). If `y_min_sq > y_max_sq`, the program does not perform any additional updates to these variables.***
