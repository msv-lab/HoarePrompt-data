First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State:
  - `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)
  - `count` is updated according to the given rules
  - `r_squared` is \(r \times r\)
  - `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
  - `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive
  - `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\)
  - `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1\)
  - `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\)
  - `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2\)

Code Snippet:
```python
y_max_sq = r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1
```

Let's break down the code:

- `r_plus_1_squared` is defined as \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
- `x_squared` is defined as \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\)
- `y_max_sq` is redefined in the code snippet as `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`

Substituting the expressions for `r_plus_1_squared` and `x_squared`:

- `r_plus_1_squared = (r + 1) * (r + 1)`
- `x_squared = (x + 1) * (x + 1)`

Therefore, the new value of `y_max_sq` is:
\[ y_max_sq = (r + 1)^2 - (x + 1)^2 - 1 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ y_max_sq = r^2 + 2r + 1 - (x^2 + 2x + 1) - 1 \]
\[ y_max_sq = r^2 + 2r + 1 - x^2 - 2x - 1 - 1 \]
\[ y_max_sq = r^2 + 2r - x^2 - 2x - 1 \]

This expression is the same as the original definition of `y_max_sq`. Since no other variables are updated, the values of `r`, `count`, `r_squared`, `r_plus_1_squared`, `x`, `x_squared`, `y_max`, and `y_min_sq` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive, `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\), `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\), `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2\)**
