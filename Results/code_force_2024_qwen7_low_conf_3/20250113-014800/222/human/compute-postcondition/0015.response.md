The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from being increased by 1 (previously) to being increased by 2 now. The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 2, `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(int(data[index-1]))`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 2, `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(int(data[index-1]))`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`**
