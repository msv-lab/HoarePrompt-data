According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5 for each test case, and the sum of all r values does not exceed 10^5.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a line of input.
   - `index` is 1.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

3. **Adjustments Needed**: 
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is given to be between 1 and 1000, we only need to ensure that `t` is non-zero.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The value of `r`, `data`, `index`, and `results` do not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. These can be handled within the loop itself or do not need adjustment for the loop to start.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
