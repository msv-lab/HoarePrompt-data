The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `r`. Given the initial state, `index` is increased by 1, `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(int(data[index-1]))`, and `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index-1])`. After executing `r = int(data[index])`, the value of `r` is updated to `int(data[index])`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 1, `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(int(data[index-1]))`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`**
