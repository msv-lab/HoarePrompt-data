To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( r \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^5 \).
- `count` is updated based on certain conditions involving `x`, `y_max`, and `y_min`.
- `r_squared` is \( r \times r \).
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
- `x` is \( x + 1 \) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive.
- `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\).
- `y_max_sq` is \( r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1 \).
- `y_max` is \(\lfloor \sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1} \rfloor\).

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `x` from \(-r\) to \(r\). For the loop to continue, the next value of `x` should be \(-r + 1\).

### Updated States for the Next Iteration:
- Since the loop increments `x` by 1 each time, the new value of `x` will be \(-r + 1\).
- Therefore, `x_squared` will be \((-r + 1 + 1)^2 = (-r)^2 = r^2\).

### Other States:
- The value of `r` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
- `r_squared` and `r_plus_1_squared` also remain the same as they are functions of `r`.

### Summary of Adjusted States:
- `x` changes from its previous value to \(-r + 1\).
- `x_squared` changes from \((x + 1)^2\) to \(r^2\).

### Final Answer:
State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), and `x_squared` is \(r^2\).**

So, the final state can be expressed as:

State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \(r^2\)**.
