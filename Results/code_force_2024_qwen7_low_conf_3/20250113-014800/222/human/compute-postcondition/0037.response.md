Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\), `y_min_sq` is \(2*r - 1\), `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\). Since the if condition `y_min_sq > y_max_sq` is false, this condition does not affect the variables, hence the postcondition remains as the precondition.***
