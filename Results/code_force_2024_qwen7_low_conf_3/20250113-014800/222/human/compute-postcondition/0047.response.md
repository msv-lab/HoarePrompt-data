The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `r`. `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\). The function calculates a total count based on conditions inside the loop and returns this count.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `r` within the range \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\) and return the total count calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `r` such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), and returns the total count calculated based on conditions inside the loop.**
