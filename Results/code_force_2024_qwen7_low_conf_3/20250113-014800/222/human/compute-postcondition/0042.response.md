The code `y_max = math.floor(math.sqrt(y_max_sq))` calculates `y_max` as the floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`. Given that `y_max_sq` is defined as `4r - 1`, we substitute this into the equation.

So, `y_max = math.floor(math.sqrt(4r - 1))`.

Since the value of `r` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `y_max_sq` is `4r - 1`, and `y_max` is the floor of the square root of `4r - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\), `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\), `y_max` is \(\mathit{math.floor}(\sqrt{4r - 1})\)**.
