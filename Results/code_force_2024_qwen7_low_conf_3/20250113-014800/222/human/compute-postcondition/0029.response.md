The code `y_max = math.floor(math.sqrt(y_max_sq))` calculates the value of `y_max` using the formula provided. Let's break it down:

1. `y_max_sq` is defined as `r * (r + 1) - x * (x + 1) - 1`.
2. `y_max` is calculated as the floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`.

Since `y_max_sq` is already defined in terms of `r` and `x`, the calculation of `y_max` does not introduce any new variables but rather computes a value based on the existing ones.

Therefore, the only changes are in the value of `y_max`. All other variables remain as per their initial state.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `count` is updated according to the given rules; `r_squared` is `r * r`; `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x` is \(x + 1\) within the range \([-r, r]\) inclusive; `x_squared` is \((x + 1) \times (x + 1)\); `y_max_sq` is \(r \times (r + 1) - x \times (x + 1) - 1\); `y_max` is \(\math.floor(\sqrt{r^2 + 2r - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\).**
