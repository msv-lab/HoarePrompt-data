`results` appends the string representation of `func_1(r)`. The value of `r` is equal to `int(data[index])`, and since `index` is increased by 2, the previous value of `index` is irrelevant for this calculation. The state of `t` and `index` remains unchanged, and `results` now includes the string representation of `func_1(r)`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 2, `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(int(data[index-1]))` and the string representation of `func_1(r)`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`**
