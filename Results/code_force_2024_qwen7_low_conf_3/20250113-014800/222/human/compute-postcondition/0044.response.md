Postcondition: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated based on the following conditions: if \(x^2 < r^2\), then `count` is updated to `count + 4r + 2`; otherwise, `count` is updated to `count + 2 \cdot \left\lfloor \sqrt{4r - 1} \right\rfloor + 1`. Additionally, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\), `y_min_sq` is \(2r - 1\), `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\), and `y_max` is \(\left\lfloor \sqrt{4r - 1} \right\rfloor\).**
