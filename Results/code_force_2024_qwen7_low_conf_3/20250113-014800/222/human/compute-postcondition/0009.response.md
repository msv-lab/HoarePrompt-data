Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`.
   - `index` is increased by 1.
   - `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(r)`.

2. **Determine the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - At the end of each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - Since the loop has just completed one iteration, `t` must be decreased by 1 from its value at the start of this iteration.
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is based on the current value of `data[index]`.
   - `index` is increased by 1.
   - `results` now contains the result of the function applied to the previous value of `r`.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration:**
   - `t` must now be `t - 1` (since it was decremented by 1).
   - `r` remains the same as it is determined by the current value of `data[index]`.
   - `index` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
   - `results` will contain the string representation of `func_1(r)` for the current value of `r`.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 but now decreased by 1.
   - `r` is still an integer equal to `int(data[index])`.
   - `index` is increased by 1.
   - `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(r)`.

Therefore, the new state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`, `index` is increased by 1, `results` contains the string representation of `func_1(r)`**.
