`x_squared` is assigned the value of `x * x`. The previous value of `x` is \(-r + 1\), so `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)**
