Since the condition `y_min_sq > y_max_sq` is false, the line `y_min = math.ceil(math.sqrt(y_min_sq)) if y_min_sq > 0 else 0` will evaluate the `else` part, meaning `y_min` will be set to `0`.

Let's check the impact on each variable:
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\).
- `count` is updated according to the given rules.
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\).
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
- `x` is \(-r + 1\).
- `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\).
- `y_min_sq` is \(2*r - 1\).
- `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\).

The code only changes the value of `y_min` to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is updated according to the given rules, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x` is \(-r + 1\), `x_squared` is \((-r + 1) * (-r + 1)\), `y_min_sq` is \(2*r - 1\), `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\), `y_min` is 0.**
