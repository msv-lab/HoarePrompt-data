#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5.
def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
    #The program returns 3 times r squared, where r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `r` where `1 <= r <= 10^5`. It calculates and returns the value of `3 * r * r`, which is three times the square of `r`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function correctly computes the intended result based on the input constraint.
