Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the number of lattice points using the formula `3 * r * r`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the number of lattice points with a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to `r` but strictly less than `r+1` is given by the formula `4 * (2 * r - 1)`.

To verify this, consider the following:

- For `r = 1`, the correct number of lattice points is 8 (the points (±1, ±1), (±1, 0), (0, ±1)).
- The program outputs `3 * 1 * 1 = 3`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one input case.
