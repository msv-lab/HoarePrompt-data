Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. According to the problem description, the task is to find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to \( r \) but strictly less than \( r+1 \). However, the provided implementation simply returns \( 3 \times r^2 \), which is not the correct formula for the number of such lattice points.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to use a more complex approach involving counting lattice points within a specific annulus (the region between two concentric circles). The correct solution would involve calculating the number of lattice points in the circle of radius \( r+1 \) and subtracting the number of lattice points in the circle of radius \( r \).

The provided function `func_1(r)` simply calculates \( 3 \times r^2 \), which is incorrect for the problem at hand. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
