### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the annotated code step-by-step to evaluate the correctness of the function `func_1(r)`.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the number of lattice points whose Euclidean distance from the origin (0,0) lies in the interval \([r, r+1)\).
   - The Euclidean distance from (0,0) to a point (x, y) is given by \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - For a given radius \(r\), the number of lattice points within a circle of radius \(r\) can be approximated by the area of the circle, which is \(\pi r^2\).
   - To get the number of lattice points in the annular region \([r, r+1)\), we subtract the area of the circle of radius \(r\) from the area of the circle of radius \(r+1\):
     \[
     \pi (r+1)^2 - \pi r^2 = \pi (2r + 1)
     \]
   - This simplifies to approximately \(2\pi r + \pi\), which is roughly \(6.2832r + 3.1416\).

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The provided function `func_1(r)` simply returns \(3 * r * r\), which is \(3r^2\).

4. **Comparison with Expected Results**:
   - Let's compare the output of `func_1(r)` with the expected results for the given test cases:
     - For \( r = 1 \):
       \[ 3 \times 1^2 = 3 \quad (\text{Expected: 8}) \]
     - For \( r = 2 \):
       \[ 3 \times 2^2 = 12 \quad (\text{Expected: 16}) \]
     - For \( r = 3 \):
       \[ 3 \times 3^2 = 27 \quad (\text{Expected: 20}) \]
     - For \( r = 4 \):
       \[ 3 \times 4^2 = 48 \quad (\text{Expected: 24}) \]
     - For \( r = 5 \):
       \[ 3 \times 5^2 = 75 \quad (\text{Expected: 40}) \]
     - For \( r = 1984 \):
       \[ 3 \times 1984^2 = 12505248 \quad (\text{Expected: 12504}) \]

   - Clearly, \(3r^2\) is significantly off from the expected values for these test cases. The discrepancy is due to the fact that \(3r^2\) does not accurately represent the number of lattice points in the annular region.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of lattice points in the specified annular region.
   - The original assessment was accurate in noting that the function `func_1(r) = 3 * r * r` does not match the expected results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1(r)` does not accurately compute the number of lattice points in the annular region \([r, r+1)\).
