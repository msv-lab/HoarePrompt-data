You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an integer r , find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean
distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to r but strictly less than r+1 .

A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. The Euclidean distance
from (0, 0) to the point (x,y) is \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer r (1 \leq r \leq
10^5 ).

The sum of r over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of lattice points
that have an Euclidean distance d from (0, 0) such that r \leq d < r+1 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `r` where `1 <= r <= 10^5`. It calculates and returns the value of `3 * r * r`, which is three times the square of `r`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function correctly computes the intended result based on the input constraint.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of lattice points with Euclidean distances between \( r \) and \( r+1 \).
- The formula to calculate the number of lattice points within a circle of radius \( r \) is \( \pi r^2 \). However, we need to exclude points within the circle of radius \( r \) and include points just within the annular region \( [r, r+1) \).
- For small radii, this can be approximated using the difference in areas of two circles:
  \[ \text{Number of lattice points} \approx \pi (r+1)^2 - \pi r^2 = \pi ((r+1)^2 - r^2) = \pi (2r + 1) \]
- Given the constraints, the function `func_1(r)` uses a simplified approximation \( 3r^2 \) which is close to the actual value when \( r \) is large.
- We need to verify if the function `func_1(r) = 3 * r * r` matches the expected results for given test cases.

Given the example test cases:

- For \( r = 1 \): 
  \[ 3 \times 1^2 = 3 \] (Expected: 8)
- For \( r = 2 \):
  \[ 3 \times 2^2 = 12 \] (Expected: 16)
- For \( r = 3 \):
  \[ 3 \times 3^2 = 27 \] (Expected: 20)
- For \( r = 4 \):
  \[ 3 \times 4^2 = 48 \] (Expected: 24)
- For \( r = 5 \):
  \[ 3 \times 5^2 = 75 \] (Expected: 40)
- For \( r = 1984 \):
  \[ 3 \times 1984^2 = 12505248 \] (Expected: 12504)

Upon closer inspection, it appears the function `func_1(r)` does not correctly approximate the number of lattice points for the given ranges of \( r \). The discrepancy is due to the fact that the actual formula is more complex and involves rounding and integer considerations not captured by \( 3r^2 \).
