### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the given function `func_1(r)`:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to count the number of lattice points whose Euclidean distance from the origin \((0, 0)\) lies in the range \([r, r+1)\).

2. **Function `func_1(r)`**: The function returns `3 * r * r`.

3. **Original Assessment Analysis**: The original assessment suggested that `func_1(r) = 3 * r * r` is an approximation for the number of lattice points in the annular region \([r, r+1)\). However, upon closer inspection, this approximation does not match the expected results for the given test cases.

   - For \( r = 1 \): Expected: 8, Actual: \( 3 \times 1^2 = 3 \)
   - For \( r = 2 \): Expected: 16, Actual: \( 3 \times 2^2 = 12 \)
   - For \( r = 3 \): Expected: 20, Actual: \( 3 \times 3^2 = 27 \)
   - For \( r = 4 \): Expected: 24, Actual: \( 3 \times 4^2 = 48 \)
   - For \( r = 5 \): Expected: 40, Actual: \( 3 \times 5^2 = 75 \)
   - For \( r = 1984 \): Expected: 12504, Actual: \( 3 \times 1984^2 = 12505248 \)

These discrepancies indicate that the function `func_1(r)` is not providing the correct number of lattice points. 

However, let's consider the correct approach to solve this problem:

- The number of lattice points in the annular region \([r, r+1)\) can be calculated by counting the points that lie on the grid lines at integer coordinates and are within the specified range.
- This is a well-known combinatorial problem, and the exact formula involves more complex calculations considering the integer nature of the points.

Given that the function `func_1(r)` provides a simple and incorrect approximation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
