### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its annotated version against the problem description.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that have a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to \( r \) but strictly less than \( r+1 \).

The Euclidean distance from (0, 0) to a point (x, y) is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).

The number of such lattice points can be determined by considering the circle centered at (0, 0) with radius \( r \) and the circle with radius \( r+1 \). The number of lattice points in the annular region between these two circles can be derived from the formula \( 4 \times (2r - 1) \).

#### Provided Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
```

#### Annotated Code:
- Before the function call, \( r \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^5 \).
- The function `func_1` returns \( 3 \times r^2 \).

#### Analysis:
The provided solution uses the formula \( 3 \times r^2 \) to calculate the number of lattice points, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The correct formula is \( 4 \times (2r - 1) \).

Let's check the given examples:

- For \( r = 1 \):
  - Correct number of lattice points: 8 (as described in the problem note).
  - Program output: \( 3 \times 1^2 = 3 \), which is incorrect.

- For \( r = 2 \):
  - Correct number of lattice points: 16.
  - Program output: \( 3 \times 2^2 = 12 \), which is incorrect.

- For \( r = 3 \):
  - Correct number of lattice points: 20.
  - Program output: \( 3 \times 3^2 = 27 \), which is incorrect.

- For \( r = 4 \):
  - Correct number of lattice points: 24.
  - Program output: \( 3 \times 4^2 = 48 \), which is incorrect.

- For \( r = 5 \):
  - Correct number of lattice points: 40.
  - Program output: \( 3 \times 5^2 = 75 \), which is incorrect.

- For \( r = 1984 \):
  - Correct number of lattice points: 12504.
  - Program output: \( 3 \times 1984^2 = 12211104 \), which is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not use the correct formula to determine the number of lattice points. Therefore, the program is incorrect for all test cases as per the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
