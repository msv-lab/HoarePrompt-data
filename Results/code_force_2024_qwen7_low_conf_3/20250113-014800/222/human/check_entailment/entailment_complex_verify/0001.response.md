Reasoning:
- The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the function `func_1(r) = 3 * r * r` approximates the number of lattice points within the specified range based on the area of circles. However, this approach is not accurate for lattice points, especially for smaller values of \( r \).
- According to the problem statement, the goal is to find the number of lattice points with Euclidean distances from (0, 0) that are greater than or equal to \( r \) but strictly less than \( r+1 \). This involves counting specific lattice points rather than approximating the area of circles.
- The correct approach would involve a more precise calculation, considering the integer nature of the coordinates and the exact boundaries of the annular region.
- Let's consider the example test cases:
  - For \( r = 1 \), the points are \((\pm 1, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1)\), \((\pm 1, \pm 1)\), totaling 8 points.
  - For \( r = 2 \), the points are \((\pm 2, 0)\), \((0, \pm 2)\), \((\pm 2, \pm 1)\), \((\pm 1, \pm 2)\), excluding those within the circle of radius 1, resulting in 16 points.
  - For larger \( r \), the number of lattice points is not simply \( 3r^2 \), but follows a more complex pattern involving integer coordinates.

The function `func_1(r) = 3 * r * r` does not accurately reflect the number of lattice points in the specified range. The original assessment's reasoning is flawed because it uses an approximation based on area, which does not account for the discrete nature of lattice points.

Final: **False**
