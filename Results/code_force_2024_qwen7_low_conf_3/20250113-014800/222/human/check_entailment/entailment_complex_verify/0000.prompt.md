You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an integer r , find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean
distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to r but strictly less than r+1 .

A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. The Euclidean distance
from (0, 0) to the point (x,y) is \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer r (1 \leq r \leq
10^5 ).

The sum of r over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of lattice points
that have an Euclidean distance d from (0, 0) such that r \leq d < r+1 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5.
def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
    #The program returns 3 times r squared, where r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `r` where `1 <= r <= 10^5`. It calculates and returns the value of `3 * r * r`, which is three times the square of `r`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function correctly computes the intended result based on the input constraint.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the number of lattice points using the formula `3 * r * r`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the number of lattice points with a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to `r` but strictly less than `r+1` is given by the formula `4 * (2 * r - 1)`.

To verify this, consider the following:

- For `r = 1`, the correct number of lattice points is 8 (the points (±1, ±1), (±1, 0), (0, ±1)).
- The program outputs `3 * 1 * 1 = 3`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one input case.
