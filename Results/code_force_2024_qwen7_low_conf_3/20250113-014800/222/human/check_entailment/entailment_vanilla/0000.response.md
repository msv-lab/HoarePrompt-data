Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of lattice points with Euclidean distances between \( r \) and \( r+1 \).
- The formula to calculate the number of lattice points within a circle of radius \( r \) is \( \pi r^2 \). However, we need to exclude points within the circle of radius \( r \) and include points just within the annular region \( [r, r+1) \).
- For small radii, this can be approximated using the difference in areas of two circles:
  \[ \text{Number of lattice points} \approx \pi (r+1)^2 - \pi r^2 = \pi ((r+1)^2 - r^2) = \pi (2r + 1) \]
- Given the constraints, the function `func_1(r)` uses a simplified approximation \( 3r^2 \) which is close to the actual value when \( r \) is large.
- We need to verify if the function `func_1(r) = 3 * r * r` matches the expected results for given test cases.

Given the example test cases:

- For \( r = 1 \): 
  \[ 3 \times 1^2 = 3 \] (Expected: 8)
- For \( r = 2 \):
  \[ 3 \times 2^2 = 12 \] (Expected: 16)
- For \( r = 3 \):
  \[ 3 \times 3^2 = 27 \] (Expected: 20)
- For \( r = 4 \):
  \[ 3 \times 4^2 = 48 \] (Expected: 24)
- For \( r = 5 \):
  \[ 3 \times 5^2 = 75 \] (Expected: 40)
- For \( r = 1984 \):
  \[ 3 \times 1984^2 = 12505248 \] (Expected: 12504)

Upon closer inspection, it appears the function `func_1(r)` does not correctly approximate the number of lattice points for the given ranges of \( r \). The discrepancy is due to the fact that the actual formula is more complex and involves rounding and integer considerations not captured by \( 3r^2 \).

Correctness: **False**
