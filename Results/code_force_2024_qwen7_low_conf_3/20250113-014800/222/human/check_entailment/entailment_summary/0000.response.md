Reasoning: 
The problem requires finding the number of lattice points that lie within a ring defined by the radii \( r \) and \( r+1 \). For a given radius \( r \), the number of lattice points can be calculated using a specific formula, which involves counting the points within the circle of radius \( r+1 \) and subtracting the points within the circle of radius \( r \).

The provided solution uses the function `func_1(r)` which returns \( 3 \times r \times r \). However, this formula does not correctly calculate the number of lattice points in the specified annular region. The correct formula to compute the number of lattice points in the ring between two concentric circles with radii \( r \) and \( r+1 \) is more complex and typically involves sums of certain arithmetic sequences.

Since the provided function does not correctly implement the required logic and instead returns a simple quadratic expression, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
