The function `func_1` accepts two distinct strings `a` and `b`, both consisting of characters X and O, with each string having a length between 1 and 30 * len(a). It returns either \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\) or \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\) based on the comparison of the lengths of `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, it returns \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\); otherwise, it returns \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\). This means the function performs a conditional operation based on the string lengths and returns a numeric value as the result.
