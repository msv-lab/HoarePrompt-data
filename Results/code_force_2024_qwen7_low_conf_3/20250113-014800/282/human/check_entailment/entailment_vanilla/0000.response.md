Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Generation of Magic Words:**
   - The program reads `n` from input, indicating the number of distinct magic words to generate.
   - It then uses a while loop to generate these magic words. The function `func_1(a, b)` is used to generate unique identifiers for pairs of words, ensuring that the generated identifiers do not overlap.
   - The magic words are generated using a simple pattern ('XO' repeated `i` times, where `i` is the index of the current word).

2. **Validation of Magic Words:**
   - The generated magic words are stored in the list `w`.
   - A dictionary `q` is used to store the unique substrings (identified by `func_1`) and their corresponding positions in the list of magic words. This helps in validating the uniqueness and order of the words.
   - The program checks for overlapping substrings and ensures that no duplicates exist by verifying the conditions within the loop.

3. **Printing the Magic Words:**
   - After generating the magic words, the program prints them. Each word follows the pattern 'XO' repeated `i` times, ensuring they are distinct and meet the length constraints.

4. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program then reads `q` from input, indicating the number of students and their spell powers.
   - For each query, it reads the power of the spell and looks up the indices `(u, v)` in the dictionary `q` that correspond to the given spell power.
   - It then prints the indices `u + 1` and `v + 1` to match the required format.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` generates unique identifiers for substrings based on the pair of words (`a`, `b`). It ensures that identifiers are unique even when the order of words changes.

Given the above points, the program correctly generates the magic words, validates their uniqueness and order, and accurately determines the indices of the words used by the students based on the provided spell power.

Correctness: **True**
