You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value
of n .

Professor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to
prepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string
consisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating
two magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its
different non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is
equal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and
XOXO.

Each student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.
Since the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of
the two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided
by Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a
student chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of
their spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,
and of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out
which two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.

Your program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n
distinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the
spell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the
correct order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.

Interaction

This is an interactive problem.

First, your program should read a single integer n (1 \le n \le 1000 ), the
number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has
created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must
have at least 1 and at most 30\cdot n characters, and each character must be
either X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \le i
\le n ).

Then, your program should read a single integer q (1 \le q \le 1000 ), the
number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process
q times, one per student.

For the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power
of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two
indices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n
inclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of
different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program
must print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \le u_j, v_j \le n ).

Note that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a
spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student
in the exact order.

Remember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after
printing u_j and v_j for each student.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
