You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value
of n .

Professor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to
prepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string
consisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating
two magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its
different non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is
equal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and
XOXO.

Each student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.
Since the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of
the two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided
by Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a
student chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of
their spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,
and of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out
which two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.

Your program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n
distinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the
spell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the
correct order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.

Interaction

This is an interactive problem.

First, your program should read a single integer n (1 \le n \le 1000 ), the
number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has
created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must
have at least 1 and at most 30\cdot n characters, and each character must be
either X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \le i
\le n ).

Then, your program should read a single integer q (1 \le q \le 1000 ), the
number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process
q times, one per student.

For the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power
of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two
indices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n
inclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of
different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program
must print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \le u_j, v_j \le n ).

Note that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a
spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student
in the exact order.

Remember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after
printing u_j and v_j for each student.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two distinct strings `a` and `b`, both consisting of characters X and O, with each string having a length between 1 and 30 * len(a). It returns either \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\) or \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\) based on the comparison of the lengths of `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, it returns \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\); otherwise, it returns \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\). This means the function performs a conditional operation based on the string lengths and returns a numeric value as the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Generation of Magic Words:**
   - The program reads `n` from input, indicating the number of distinct magic words to generate.
   - It then uses a while loop to generate these magic words. The function `func_1(a, b)` is used to generate unique identifiers for pairs of words, ensuring that the generated identifiers do not overlap.
   - The magic words are generated using a simple pattern ('XO' repeated `i` times, where `i` is the index of the current word).

2. **Validation of Magic Words:**
   - The generated magic words are stored in the list `w`.
   - A dictionary `q` is used to store the unique substrings (identified by `func_1`) and their corresponding positions in the list of magic words. This helps in validating the uniqueness and order of the words.
   - The program checks for overlapping substrings and ensures that no duplicates exist by verifying the conditions within the loop.

3. **Printing the Magic Words:**
   - After generating the magic words, the program prints them. Each word follows the pattern 'XO' repeated `i` times, ensuring they are distinct and meet the length constraints.

4. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program then reads `q` from input, indicating the number of students and their spell powers.
   - For each query, it reads the power of the spell and looks up the indices `(u, v)` in the dictionary `q` that correspond to the given spell power.
   - It then prints the indices `u + 1` and `v + 1` to match the required format.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` generates unique identifiers for substrings based on the pair of words (`a`, `b`). It ensures that identifiers are unique even when the order of words changes.

Given the above points, the program correctly generates the magic words, validates their uniqueness and order, and accurately determines the indices of the words used by the students based on the provided spell power.
