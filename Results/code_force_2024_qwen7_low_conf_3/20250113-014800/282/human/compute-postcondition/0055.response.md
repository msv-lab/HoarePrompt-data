`p` is assigned the value `int(input())`. This means `p` now holds the integer input from the user, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `q` is 1; `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`); `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[i] + words[j]` for all valid pairs `(i, j)`; `u` and `v` are the first and second values in the tuple corresponding to the key `p` in `powers`; `p` is an integer input from the user; the standard output buffer is flushed**.
