The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are distinct strings consisting of characters X and O, and each string has at least 1 and at most 30 * len(a) characters. If the length of string `a` is greater than or equal to the length of string `b`, the function returns `(a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1`; otherwise, it returns `(a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two distinct strings `a` and `b`, and based on their lengths, return either \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\) or \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\).
