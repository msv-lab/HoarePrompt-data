According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is within the range defined by `n`. The given initial states are:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer
- `concatenated` is a string formed by concatenating `words[1]` with each `words[j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`
- `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each iteration of the loop, and `powers` contains the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated` for each iteration as keys with corresponding values as `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `j` is within the range `[0, n)`. Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `j` must be 0 initially (since the loop starts iterating from `j = 0`)

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
