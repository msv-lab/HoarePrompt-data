The code prints the values of `u` and `v` which are the first and second values in the tuple corresponding to the key `p` in the dictionary `powers`. However, the actual values of `u` and `v` are not computed within the given code snippet; they are retrieved from the dictionary `powers`. The values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged after the print statement.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `q`, `words`, `powers`, and `p`) are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the Output State remains as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `q` is at least 1, `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`), `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[i] + words[j]` for all valid pairs `(i, j)`, `p` is an input integer, and `u` and `v` are the first and second values in the tuple corresponding to the key `p` in `powers`. The values of `u` and `v` are printed.**
