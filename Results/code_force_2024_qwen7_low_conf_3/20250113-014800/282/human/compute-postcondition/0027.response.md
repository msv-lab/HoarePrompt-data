The code `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1` updates the dictionary `powers` with the key `power`. Since `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, and the initial value of `i` is 1, the value of `i + 1` is 2. However, the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we denote it as `j`.

The updated dictionary `powers` will have the key `power` with the value `(2, j + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `concatenated` is `a + b`, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j_max + 1]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`, and the dictionary `powers` now contains the key `power` (where `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`) with the value `(2, j + 1)`**
