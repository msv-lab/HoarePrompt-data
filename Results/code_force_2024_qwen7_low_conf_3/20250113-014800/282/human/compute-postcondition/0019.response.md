Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `concatenated` is undefined.
   - `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Increment of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, after the first iteration, `i` will become `1`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` is 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should be 2.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged and must still be a positive integer.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `concatenated` remains undefined since there is no information about its modification inside the loop.
   - `powers` dictionary remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and there is no information indicating any changes to this dictionary during the iteration.

Based on these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `concatenated` is undefined, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`**.
