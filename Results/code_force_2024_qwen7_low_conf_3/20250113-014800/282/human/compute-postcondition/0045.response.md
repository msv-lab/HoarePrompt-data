The code snippet updates the dictionary `powers` with the key `power` (which is 22), setting its value to a tuple containing `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given the initial values of `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, the updated values will be `(3, 3)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `concatenated` is "wordswords", `power` is 22, `powers[22]` is (3, 3)**
