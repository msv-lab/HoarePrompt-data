The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `q`. This means that the user will input an integer, which will be assigned to `q`. The values of `n`, `words`, and `powers` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 1000\) as assigned by user input, `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`), `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[i] + words[j]` for all valid pairs `(i, j)` and values as tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)`**.
