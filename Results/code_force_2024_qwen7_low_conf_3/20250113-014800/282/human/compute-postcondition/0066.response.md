Functionality: **The function processes a set of magic words, each consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', with lengths between 1 and 30*n inclusive, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and all magic words are distinct. It first generates these words and prints them. Then, it reads a number q, representing the number of queries, and for each query, it reads an integer p. For each p, it retrieves the indices (u, v) corresponding to the key p in the `powers` dictionary, which maps lengths of unique substrings in the concatenated form of `words[i] + words[j]` to their respective indices (i+1, j+1). Finally, it prints the indices (u, v) for each query.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the generation of the magic words and the printing of these words.
- It correctly processes the number of queries q and retrieves the indices (u, v) from the `powers` dictionary.
- However, the function does not handle the case where the value of p is not present in the `powers` dictionary. In such a case, the function would raise a KeyError. To address this, the function should include error handling to manage this scenario, e.g., by printing an appropriate message or returning a default value.
