`i` is incremented by 1 due to the typical behavior of accessing elements in a list with an index, but the value of `j` is not provided, and no new value is assigned to `concatenated`. Therefore, the only impacted variable is `i`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1**
