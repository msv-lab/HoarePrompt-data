The code snippet `print(u, v)` prints the values of `u` and `v` to the standard output buffer. Since `u` and `v` are taken from the same tuple in `powers[p]`, they are the same value. The values of `n`, `q`, `words`, `p`, and the standard output buffer are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `q` is 1; `words` is a list of strings where the i-th element is a string of length i consisting of i 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if i % 2 == 1) or an empty string (if i % 2 == 0); `p` is an integer obtained from user input; `u` and `v` are the same value from the tuple in `powers[p]`; the standard output buffer contains `u` and `v`.**
