The code calculates the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated` using a nested list comprehension. The value of `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, and the previous value of `power` is `(2, j + 2)`. After executing the code, the new value of `power` will be the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.

Let's denote the value of `concatenated` as `word1_wordj` where `word1` is `words[1]` and `wordj` is `words[j]`.

The calculation of `power` involves generating all possible substrings of `word1_wordj` and then finding the length of the set of these substrings.

Since the exact values of `words[1]` and `words[j]` are not given, let's assume `words[1]` is "abc" and `words[j]` is "def". Then `concatenated` is "abcdef".

The substrings of "abcdef" are:
- "a"
- "ab"
- "abc"
- "abcd"
- "abcde"
- "abcdef"
- "b"
- "bc"
- "bcd"
- "bcde"
- "bcdef"
- "c"
- "cd"
- "cde"
- "cdf"
- "cdef"
- "d"
- "de"
- "def"
- "e"
- "ef"
- "f"

The set of these substrings is:
{"a", "ab", "abc", "abcd", "abcde", "abcdef", "b", "bc", "bcd", "bcde", "bcdef", "c", "cd", "cde", "cdf", "cdef", "d", "de", "def", "e", "ef", "f"}

The length of this set is 19.

Therefore, the new value of `power` is 19.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j_max + 1]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`, with the additional key `power` (where `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`) with the value `(19, j + 2)`**
