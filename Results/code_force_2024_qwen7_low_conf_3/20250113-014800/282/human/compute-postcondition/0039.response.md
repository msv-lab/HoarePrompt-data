The code assigns the value of `words[i] + words[j]` to the variable `concatenated`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `j` is 1
- `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[2]` and `words[0]`
- `power` is 20
- `powers[20]` is 3
- `powers[power]` is 1

The updated value of `concatenated` will be `words[2] + words[1]` because `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[2]` and `words[1]`, `power` is 20, `powers[20]` is 3, `powers[power]` is 1**
