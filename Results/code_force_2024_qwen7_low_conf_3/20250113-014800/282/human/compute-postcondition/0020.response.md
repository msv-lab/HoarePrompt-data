According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The initial states provided are:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `concatenated` is undefined
- `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The other states (`i`, `concatenated`, and `powers`) are not directly relevant to the condition for the loop to execute.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `for j in range(n)`, which means the loop will run if `n` is at least 1.
2. Since `n` is described as a positive integer, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `concatenated` is undefined, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`**
