Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is a value between 0 and `n-1`, `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[2]` and `words[j]`, `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` is the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each `j`, it concatenates `words[i]` (which is `words[2]` since `i` remains 2 throughout the loop) with `words[j]`.
- It calculates the length of the set of all unique substrings of the concatenated string.
- It stores this length (`power`) as a key in the dictionary `powers` with the value being the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will remain 2, `n` will be the original positive integer provided, and `j` will cover all valid values from 0 to `n-1`.
- `concatenated` will be the concatenation of `words[2]` and `words[j]` for each valid `j`.
- `power` will be the length of the set of all unique substrings for each `concatenated` string.
- The dictionary `powers` will contain all these values for each valid `j`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
