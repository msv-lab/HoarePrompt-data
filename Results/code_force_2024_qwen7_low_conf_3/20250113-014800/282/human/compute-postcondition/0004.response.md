The code initializes an empty dictionary named `powers`. The previous values of `n`, `q`, and `words` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `powers` dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 1000\); `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`); `powers` is an empty dictionary.**
