`p` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `q` remains at least 1, and the structure of the `words` list and the `powers` dictionary remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `q` is at least 1, `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`), `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[i] + words[j]` for all valid pairs `(i, j)`, and `p` is an input integer.**
