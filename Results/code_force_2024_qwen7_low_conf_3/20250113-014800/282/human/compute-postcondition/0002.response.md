Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two distinct strings `a` and `b`, both consisting of characters X and O, with each string having a length between 1 and 30 * len(a). It returns either \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\) or \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\) based on the comparison of the lengths of `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, it returns \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\); otherwise, it returns \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\). This means the function performs a conditional operation based on the string lengths and returns a numeric value as the result.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `a` and `b` are empty strings, the function will raise a `TypeError` because string concatenation with a number is not allowed. The function does not handle this case, so it should be noted that the function will fail if `a` or `b` are empty strings.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not check whether the strings `a` and `b` consist only of characters X and O as stated in the annotations. It only checks the length constraint, which might lead to incorrect results if the strings contain other characters. To ensure correctness, additional validation could be added to verify that `a` and `b` contain only X and O characters.
