Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `q` is at least 1, `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`), `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[i] + words[j]` for all valid pairs `(i, j)`, the standard output buffer contains the printed values `u v` corresponding to each input integer `p` which is a key in `powers`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 1000\).
   - `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`).
   - `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[i] + words[j]` for all valid pairs `(i, j)`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `q` iterations, where in each iteration:
     - An integer `p` is read from user input.
     - The dictionary `powers` is accessed using the key `p` to get the tuple `(u, v)`.
     - The values `u` and `v` are printed, and the standard output buffer is flushed.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, the final state includes the initial conditions for `n`, `q`, `words`, and `powers`.
   - The standard output buffer contains the values `u v` for each input integer `p` that was processed by the loop.

Thus, the loop ensures that for each input integer `p`, the corresponding values `u` and `v` from the `powers` dictionary are printed, and these prints accumulate in the standard output buffer.
