`concatenated` is assigned the value of `words[i] + words[j]`. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state, and the operation does not define the values of `i` or `j`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `concatenated` variable, which is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`.

The initial state is: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `concatenated` is undefined, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`**
