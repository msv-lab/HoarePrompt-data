The code `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1` assigns the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the key `power` in the dictionary `powers`. Given the initial state where `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, and `concatenated` is undefined, the only variables affected are `i` and the newly defined elements within the dictionary.

Since `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` evaluates to 2. However, the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains undefined. The dictionary `powers` is now defined with the key `power` mapping to the tuple `(2, j + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `concatenated` is undefined, `powers[power]` is (2, `j` + 1)**
