`concatenated` is updated to be the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `concatenated` is `a + b`, and `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j_max + 1]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`, with the additional key `power` (where `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`) with the value `(2, j + 2)`, the new concatenated string will be `words[1] + words[j]`.

Since the specific values of `words[1]` and `words[j]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact concatenated string. However, we can express it as `words[1] + words[j]`. The dictionary `powers` remains unchanged except for the update to the `concatenated` string.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j_max + 1]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`, with the additional key `power` (where `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`) with the value `(2, j + 2)`**.
