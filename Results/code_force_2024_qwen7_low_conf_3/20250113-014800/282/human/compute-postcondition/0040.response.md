First, let's determine the value of `concatenated` based on the given initial state:
- `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[2]` and `words[1]`.

Next, we need to calculate the value of `power` using the given code snippet:
```python
power = len(set(concatenated[k:l] for k in range(len(concatenated)) for l in
    range(k + 1, len(concatenated) + 1)))
```

Given `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[2]` and `words[1]`, let's assume `words[2]` is "abc" and `words[1]` is "def". So, `concatenated` would be "abcdef".

Let's calculate `power`:
- We need to find all unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- The substrings of "abcdef" are: "a", "ab", "abc", "abcd", "abcde", "abcdef", "b", "bc", "bcd", "bcde", "bcdef", "c", "cd", "cde", "bcdef", "d", "de", "def", "e", "ef", "f".
- The set of these substrings contains 15 unique elements.

So, `power` is 15.

Now, updating the values of the variables based on the calculation:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `j` is 1.
- `concatenated` is "abcdef".
- `power` is 15.
- `powers[20]` is 3 (unchanged).
- `powers[power]` is `powers[15]` which is not defined in the initial state and remains undefined.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `concatenated` is "abcdef", `power` is 15, `powers[20]` is 3, `powers[power]` is undefined**.
