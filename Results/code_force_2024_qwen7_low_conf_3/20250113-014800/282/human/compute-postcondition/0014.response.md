According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `concatenated` is undefined, `powers[power]` is (3, `j + 1`), and `power` is 2.

To determine the new state for the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop condition.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.
- `concatenated` remains undefined as no information about its change is provided.
- `powers[power]` will change since `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
- `power` remains 2 as it is not part of the loop condition.

Since `j` starts from 0 in the `range(n)` and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. Therefore, `powers[power]` will now be `powers[2]` which corresponds to `(3, 2)`, because `j + 1` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `concatenated` is undefined, `powers[power]` is (3, 2), `power` is 2**
