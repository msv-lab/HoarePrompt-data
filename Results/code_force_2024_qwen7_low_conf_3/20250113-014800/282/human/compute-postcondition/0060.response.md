`p` is assigned the value `int(input())`. This means `p` is an integer obtained from user input, and the previous values of `n`, `q`, and `words` remain unchanged. The dictionary `powers` and the standard output buffer also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `q` is 1; `words` is a list of strings where the i-th element is a string of length i consisting of i 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if i % 2 == 1) or an empty string (if i % 2 == 0); `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[i] + words[j]` for all valid pairs (i, j); `p` is an integer obtained from user input; the standard output buffer is empty**
