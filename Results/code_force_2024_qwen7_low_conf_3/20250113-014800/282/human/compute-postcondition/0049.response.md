To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the for loop and ensure they meet the necessary conditions.

1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable is `_`, which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the loop index is not needed. This does not affect the conditions required for the loop to execute since the loop will run `q` times regardless of what `_` is set to.

2. **`q`**: The number of iterations of the loop is determined by the value of `q`. For the loop to execute, `q` must be at least 1 because the loop runs `q` times. Given that `q` is assigned by user input and \(1 \leq q \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **`words`**: The `words` list contains strings defined by specific rules. Since the loop does not directly manipulate `words`, no adjustments are needed for this list for the loop to execute.

4. **`powers`**: The `powers` dictionary contains information about unique substrings in the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]` for all valid pairs `(i, j)`. The loop does not directly manipulate this dictionary, so no adjustments are needed for this dictionary for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `q` being at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`), `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[i] + words[j]` for all valid pairs `(i, j)` and values as tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
