Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `concatenated` is a string formed by concatenating `words[1]` with each `words[j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each iteration of the loop, and `powers` contains the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated` for each iteration as keys with corresponding values as `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `concatenated` is undefined.
   - `powers` is a dictionary with initial keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j + 1)`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration of the loop (`j` from 0 to `n-1`), the following operations are performed:
     - `concatenated` is updated to `words[i] + words[j]`.
     - `power` is calculated as the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.
     - A new key-value pair is added to `powers` where the key is `power` and the value is `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` remains 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `concatenated` is a string formed by concatenating `words[1]` with each `words[j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `powers` contains the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated` for each iteration as keys with corresponding values as `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **No Loop Execution**:
   - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the final state remains:
     - `i` is 1.
     - `n` is 0.
     - `concatenated` is undefined.
     - `powers` is an empty dictionary.

This ensures that the output state captures the final values and relationships of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations or if it did not execute at all.
