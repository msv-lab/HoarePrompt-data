The code snippet updates the values of `powers[power]` based on the current values of `i` and `j`. Given the previous values:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `concatenated` is "abcdef".
- `power` is 15.
- `powers[20]` is 3.
- `powers[power]` is undefined.

The code `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1` means that `powers[power]` will be assigned the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which evaluates to `(2 + 1, 1 + 1) = (3, 2)`.

Thus, the updated state of `powers[power]` is `(3, 2)`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `concatenated` is "abcdef", `power` is 15, `powers[20]` is 3, `powers[power]` is (3, 2)**.
