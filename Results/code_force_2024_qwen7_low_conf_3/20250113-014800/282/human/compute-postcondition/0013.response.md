The code assigns a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `powers[power]`. However, the value of `j` is not provided, and `power` is undefined. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `i + 1` is 3. Since `power` is undefined, it will be assigned the value of `i` (which is 2) according to the syntax used. The value of `j + 1` remains undefined because `j` is not specified. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `concatenated` is undefined, `powers[power]` is (3, `j + 1`), `power` is 2**
