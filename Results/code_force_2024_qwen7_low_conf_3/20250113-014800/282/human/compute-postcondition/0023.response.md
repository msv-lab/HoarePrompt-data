The code snippet `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1` updates the dictionary `powers` by setting the key `power` to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`
- `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`
- `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`

After executing the code, the dictionary `powers` will have its key updated to `power`, which is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, and the value will be the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2. The value of `j` is not specified, but it ranges from 0 to `n-1`. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, `powers` is a dictionary containing keys as lengths of unique substrings in `words[0] + words[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` and values as tuples `(1, j+1)`, and the dictionary `powers` now contains the key `power` (where `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`) with the value `(2, j + 1)`.**
