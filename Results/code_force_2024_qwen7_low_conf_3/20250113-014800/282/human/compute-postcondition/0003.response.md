The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only ensures that any pending output in the buffer is flushed immediately to the console. Since no new values are assigned to any variables and the condition is met, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 1000\); `words` is a list of strings where the `i`-th element is a string of length `i` consisting of `i` 'X' characters followed by either 'O' (if `i % 2 == 1`) or an empty string (if `i % 2 == 0`). The list `words` is printed with each element separated by a newline.**
