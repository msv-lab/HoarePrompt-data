`powers[power]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. Similarly, `j + 1` is assigned to `powers[power]`, and since `j` is 0, `j + 1` equals 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `concatenated`, and `power` are not directly affected by this line of code, but the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[2]` and `words[0]`, `power` is 20, `powers[20]` is 3, `powers[power]` is 1**
