#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are distinct strings consisting of characters X and O, and each string has at least 1 and at most 30 * len(a) characters.
def func_1(a, b):
    return (a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1 if a >= b else (a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1
    #The program returns (a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1 if the length of string 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of string 'b', otherwise it returns (a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1, where 'a' and 'b' are distinct strings consisting of characters X and O, and each string has at least 1 and at most 30 * len(a) characters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two distinct strings `a` and `b`, both consisting of characters X and O, with each string having a length between 1 and 30 * len(a). It returns either \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\) or \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\) based on the comparison of the lengths of `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, it returns \((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1\); otherwise, it returns \((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1\). This means the function performs a conditional operation based on the string lengths and returns a numeric value as the result.
