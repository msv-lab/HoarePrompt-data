#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    res = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if int(s[i]) < 5:
            res = i
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is -1, `i` is the index of the smallest digit in `s` that is less than '5', or `n` if no such digit exists, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), and `res` is the value of `i` when the loop breaks or remains -1 if the loop does not break.
    return res
    #The program returns `res` which is the index of the smallest digit in `s` that is less than '5', or `n` if no such digit exists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and converts it to a string `s`. It then iterates through the digits of `s` to find the smallest index `i` where the digit is less than '5'. If such a digit is found, it sets `res` to this index `i` and breaks out of the loop. If no such digit is found, `res` remains -1. Finally, the function returns `res`. The possible values for `res` are either the index of the smallest digit in `s` that is less than '5' or `n` itself if no such digit exists. This covers all edge cases including when `n` is a single-digit number (since converting it to a string will have only one character).
