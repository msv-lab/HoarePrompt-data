Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum back into the array at any position.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code iterates over `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `k` (number of operations).
   - It then reads the array `arr`.
   - The main logic lies in the following lines:
     ```python
     bsum = sum(arr)
     mx = bsum
     while r - l != 0:
         if arr[l] <= arr[r]:
             bsum -= arr[l]
             l += 1
             mx = max(mx, bsum)
         else:
             bsum -= arr[r]
             mx = max(mx, bsum)
             r -= 1
     ```
     - This part attempts to find a maximum subarray sum using a sliding window approach, but it is incorrect because it does not properly handle the insertion of sums back into the array. Instead, it is trying to find a subarray sum which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The commented-out function `func_1(n)` is irrelevant to solving the problem and appears to be a separate task.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum after `k` operations, it is optimal to use the largest elements available and repeatedly sum them.
   - The key insight is to sort the array and consider the largest elements for summing up multiple times (`2**k - 1` times), since inserting the largest element back into the array `k` times effectively doubles its contribution `(2**k - 1)` times.
   - The provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it uses a sliding window approach that is irrelevant to the problem.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - Sort the array.
   - Calculate the initial sum of the array.
   - Add the largest element multiple times (`2**k - 1` times), since inserting it back into the array `k` times effectively doubles its contribution `(2**k - 1)` times.
   - Ensure to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Verifying the Given Code**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution.
   - The sliding window approach used in the commented code is incorrect and does not contribute to solving the problem as stated.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The given code does not correctly solve the problem, and the provided logic is incorrect.

Final: **False**
