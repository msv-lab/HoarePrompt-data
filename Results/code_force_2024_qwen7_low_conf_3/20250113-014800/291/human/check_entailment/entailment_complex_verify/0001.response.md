### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum back into the array at any position.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code iterates over `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `k` (number of operations).
   - It then reads the array `arr`.
   - The commented-out function `func_1(n)` is irrelevant to solving the problem and appears to be a separate task.
   - The main part of the code attempts to find a maximum subarray sum using a sliding window approach but seems to be incorrectly implemented. This part does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum after `k` operations, it is optimal to use the largest elements available and repeatedly sum them.
   - If we have a large positive number in the array, adding its sum multiple times will increase the total sum significantly.
   - The key insight is to sort the array and consider the largest elements for summing up multiple times.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code uses a sliding window approach to find a maximum subarray sum, which is not necessary for solving the problem correctly.
   - The logic inside the while loop is flawed and does not contribute to the correct solution.
   - The code then prints a fixed value `mx` and a modified sum which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - Sort the array.
   - Calculate the initial sum of the array.
   - Add the largest element multiple times (`2**k - 1` times), since inserting it back into the array `k` times effectively doubles its contribution `(2**k - 1)` times.
   - Ensure to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Verification of the Given Code**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution.
   - The sliding window approach used in the commented code is incorrect and does not contribute to solving the problem as stated.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified that the given code is not implementing the correct solution. The code is attempting to solve a different problem and contains incorrect logic. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
