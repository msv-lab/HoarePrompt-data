Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum back into the array at any position.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code iterates over `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `k` (number of operations).
   - It then reads the array `arr`.
   - A segment of the code attempts to find a maximum subarray sum using a sliding window approach but seems to be incorrectly implemented. This part does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The commented-out function `func_1(n)` is irrelevant to solving the problem and appears to be a separate task.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum after `k` operations, it is optimal to use the largest elements available and repeatedly sum them.
   - If we have a large positive number in the array, adding its sum multiple times will increase the total sum significantly.
   - The key insight is to sort the array and consider the largest elements for summing up multiple times.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - Sort the array.
   - Calculate the initial sum of the array.
   - Add the largest element multiple times (`2**k - 1` times), since inserting it back into the array `k` times effectively doubles its contribution `(2**k - 1)` times.
   - Ensure to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Verifying the Given Code**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution.
   - The sliding window approach used in the commented code is incorrect and does not contribute to solving the problem as stated.

Therefore, the given code is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
