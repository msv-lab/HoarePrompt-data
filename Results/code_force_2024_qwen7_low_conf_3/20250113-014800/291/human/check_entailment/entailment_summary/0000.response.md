Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the main problem of finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing \( k \) operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the given program is incorrect:

1. **Main Logic for Array Operations**: 
   - The program attempts to sort the array to find the best subarray to manipulate. However, this approach does not consider all possible ways to insert sums into the array to maximize the final sum.
   - The logic inside the while loop is incorrect. It only moves left or right in the array based on the comparison of elements but doesn't consider other potential gains from different subarrays or inserting the sum at different positions.

2. **Calculation of Final Sum**:
   - The final sum calculation `(sum(arr) + mx * (2 ** k - 1)) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is intended to account for the effects of \( k \) operations. However, `mx` is computed incorrectly as it represents a local maximum rather than a strategic global maximum after all operations.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is completely unrelated to the main problem and does not influence the correctness of the solution to the array manipulation problem. Its purpose and implementation are irrelevant to the given task.

Given these issues, the program does not follow the correct logic to achieve the maximum possible sum of the array after \( k \) operations.

Correctness: **False**
