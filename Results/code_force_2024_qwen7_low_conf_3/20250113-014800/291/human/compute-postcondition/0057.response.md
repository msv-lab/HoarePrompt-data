According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_acc` is 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is `k + 1`, `_max` is `max(0, a[1])`, `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `n` must be at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- Since `i` is currently `k + 2`, `i` will become `k + 3` in the next iteration.
- Therefore, `n` must be greater than `k + 3`.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `_acc` remains 0.
- `i` will be `k + 3`.
- `k` will be `k + 1` (unchanged from the current state).
- `_max` remains `max(0, a[1])`.
- `_sum` remains `max(0, a[1])`.
- `a` remains a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `n` must be greater than `k + 3`.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is `k + 3`, `k` is `k + 1`, `_max` is `max(0, a[1])`, `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than `k + 3`**.
