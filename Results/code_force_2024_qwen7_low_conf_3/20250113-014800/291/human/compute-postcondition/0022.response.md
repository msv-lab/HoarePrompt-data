The code `_acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD` updates `_acc` by adding the value of `(_acc + _max) % MOD` to `_acc`. Given that `_acc` was previously `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`, this operation does not change the value of `_acc` because it is essentially setting `_acc` to its previous value plus itself modulo `MOD`.

- `_acc` remains `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`.
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `a` remains a list of integers with at least `k` elements.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`_acc` is `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`, `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements.**
