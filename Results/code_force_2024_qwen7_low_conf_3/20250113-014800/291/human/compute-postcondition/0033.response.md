According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `_acc` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input()
- `_sum` is `a[0]`
- `_max` is `a[0]`
- `n` must be at least 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and remain less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 0, it needs to become 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be 1.

For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 1.

The other states (`_acc`, `k`, `a`, `_sum`, and `_max`) do not change unless explicitly modified within the loop body, so they remain the same.

State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `_sum` is `a[0]`, `_max` is `a[0]`, `n` must be at least 1**
