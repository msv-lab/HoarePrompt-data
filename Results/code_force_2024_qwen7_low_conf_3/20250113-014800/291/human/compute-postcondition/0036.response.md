Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `_acc` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is 0
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input()
   - `_sum` is `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`
   - `_max` is the larger of `a[0]` and `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`
   - `n` must be at least 1

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in `range(n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 1 (which means the loop has run once)

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and checked against `n`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i`, which is now 2.

5. **Adjusting States**: We need to adjust the values accordingly:
   - `_acc` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop logic.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `_sum` remains unchanged as it was calculated outside the loop and does not depend on the loop variable `i`.
   - `_max` remains unchanged for the same reason.
   - `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **_acc is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `_sum` is `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`, `_max` is the larger of `a[0]` and `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`, `n` must be at least 2**
