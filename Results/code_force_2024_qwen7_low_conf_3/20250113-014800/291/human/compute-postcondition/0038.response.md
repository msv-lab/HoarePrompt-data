Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. The initial state includes the following:
   - `_acc` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is 0
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input()
   - `_sum` is calculated as `max(0, max(0, a[0] + a[1]) + a[2])`
   - `_max` is the larger of `a[0]` and `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`
   - `n` is at least 2

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   _max = max(_max, _sum)
   ```

3. The impact of this code is to update `_max` with the maximum value between its current value and `_sum`.

4. To determine the new value of `_max`, we need to consider the values of `_max` and `_sum`:
   - `_sum` is already defined as `max(0, max(0, a[0] + a[1]) + a[2])`
   - `_max` is the larger of `a[0]` and `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`

5. Since `_max` and `_sum` both depend on the values in the list `a`, let's break it down further:
   - Let `x = a[0]`
   - Let `y = a[1]`
   - Let `z = a[2]`

   Therefore:
   - `_max` is `max(x, max(0, x + y))`
   - `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, x + y) + z)`

6. After updating `_max` with `max(_max, _sum)`, `_max` will be the maximum of its current value and `_sum`.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **_acc is 0, i is 2, k is 0, a is a list of integers obtained from input(), _sum is max(0, max(0, a[0] + a[1]) + a[2]), _max is the larger of max(x, max(0, x + y)) and max(0, max(0, x + y) + z), n is at least 2**
