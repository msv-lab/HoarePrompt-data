The code sets `_max` to the maximum value between `_max` and `_sum`. Initially, `_max` is 0 and `_sum` is `a[0]`. Since `_max` is 0, the value of `_sum` (which is `a[0]`) will be assigned to `_max`.

So, the updated state is:
- `_max` is now `_sum` which is `a[0]`.
- All other variables (`_acc`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `_sum`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **_acc is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `_sum` is `a[0]`, `_max` is `a[0]`, `n` must be at least 1**
