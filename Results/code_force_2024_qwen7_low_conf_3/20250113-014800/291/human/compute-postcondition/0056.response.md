The code updates `_max` to be the maximum value between its current value and `_sum`. The previous value of `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`. Since `_max` was initially set to 0, `_max` will now be updated to `max(0, max(0, a[1]))`, which simplifies to `max(0, a[1])` because `max(0, a[1])` is already non-negative.

Other variables are not affected, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **_acc is 0, i is k + 2, k is k + 1, _max is max(0, a[1]), _sum is max(0, a[1]), a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, n must be at least 1, MOD remains unchanged**
