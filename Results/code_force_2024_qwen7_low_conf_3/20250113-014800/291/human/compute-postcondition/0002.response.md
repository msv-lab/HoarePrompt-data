Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop is iterating over the length of the string `s`.
   - The variable `i` ranges from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.

2. **Initial States Provided**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `s` is a string representation of `n`.
   - `res` is `-1`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < len(s)`.

4. **Adjusting States for Loop Execution**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `s` is a non-empty string.
   - We also need to ensure that `i` starts from `0` and will eventually reach `len(s) - 1`.

5. **Key Observations**:
   - `s` is a string representation of `n`, and since `n` is an integer, `s` must be a non-empty string (i.e., `len(s) > 0`).
   - `i` starts at `0` and will increment by `1` in each iteration.

6. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - Ensure that `s` is a non-empty string.
   - Ensure that `i` is set to `0` initially.

### Final Answer:

State: **`total` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)**
