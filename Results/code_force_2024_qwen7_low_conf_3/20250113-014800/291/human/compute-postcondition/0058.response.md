The code snippet updates `_sum` to be the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. Initially, `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`.
2. `i` is `k + 3`.

Since the exact value of `a` and `k` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`. However, we know that `_sum` will be updated based on the value of `a[i]`.

The new value of `_sum` will be:
- `max(0, _sum + a[i])`

Given that `_sum` is initially `max(0, a[1])`, let's denote `_sum` as `S` for simplicity. So, `_sum` becomes `max(0, S + a[i])`.

Other variables (`_acc`, `i`, `k`, `_max`, `a`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`_acc` is 0, `i` is `k + 3`, `k` is `k + 1`, `_max` is `max(0, a[1])`, `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than `k + 3`**.
