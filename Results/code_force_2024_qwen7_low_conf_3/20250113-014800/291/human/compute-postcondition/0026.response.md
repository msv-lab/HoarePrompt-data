`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which converts the input into integers. The values of `_acc`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The precondition that the result of `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD` is printed is not directly affected by this code snippet since `a` is not defined in the given code.

Output State: **_acc is 0, i is 0, k is 0, n and k are integers from input()**
