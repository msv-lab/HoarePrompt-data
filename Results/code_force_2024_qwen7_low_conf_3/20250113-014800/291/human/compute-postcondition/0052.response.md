The code initializes `_sum` to 0. This means that `_sum` is now 0, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state should include the updated value of `_sum` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **_acc is the result of adding _max ((k+1)+1) times, modulo MOD; i is (k+1); k is (k+1); _max is the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index n-1; `_sum` is 0; `a` is a list of integers input by the user; MOD remains unchanged.**
