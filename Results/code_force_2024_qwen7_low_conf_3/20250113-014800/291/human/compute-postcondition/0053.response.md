The code sets `_max` to 0, which means the value of `_max` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **_acc is the result of adding _max ((k+1)+1) times, modulo MOD; i is (k+1); k is (k+1); _max is 0; `_sum` is 0; `a` is a list of integers input by the user; MOD remains unchanged.**
