The code updates `_sum` by adding the current element of the list `a` (at index `i`) to `_sum` and then taking the maximum of the result and 0. Since the initial value of `_sum` is 0 and `i` is 0, the value of `a[0]` will be added to `_sum` and then the maximum of 0 and this value will be assigned back to `_sum`. However, since `_sum` starts at 0, the value of `_sum` will simply be the value of `a[0]`.

The values of `_acc`, `k`, `a`, `_max`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **_acc is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `_sum` is `a[0]`, `_max` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
