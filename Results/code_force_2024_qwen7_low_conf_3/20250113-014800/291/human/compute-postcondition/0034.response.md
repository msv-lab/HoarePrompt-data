The code updates `_sum` by setting it to the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. Given the initial state, `_sum` is initially set to `a[0]` and `_max` is also `a[0]`. We need to evaluate `_sum` based on the initial values and the condition in the code.

Let's start with the initial state:
- `_acc` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `k` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input()
- `_sum` is `a[0]`
- `_max` is `a[0]`
- `n` must be at least 1

Since `_sum` is initially set to `a[0]`, the code updates `_sum` to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`. Given `_sum` is `a[0]` and `i` is 1, the code becomes `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`.

The new value of `_sum` will be `a[0] + a[1]` if `a[0] + a[1] > 0`, otherwise it will be 0.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `_sum` is `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`
- `_max` remains `a[0]` (since `_max` is not affected by this line of code)
- All other variables (`_acc`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `_sum` is `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`, `_max` is `a[0]`, `n` must be at least 1**
