Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial States:**
   - `_acc` is the result of adding `_max` a total of `k` times, modulo `MOD`.
   - `i` is `k`.
   - `k` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `_max` is the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index `n-1`.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs based on an input value.
   - The input value determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` (which is equal to `k`) represents the current number of iterations.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the input value (let's call it `input_value`) must be greater than `i`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - After the loop runs once more, `k` will increase by 1 (since `i` starts from `k`).
   - `_acc` will be updated based on the new value of `_max` and the new value of `k`.
   - `i` will be set to the new value of `k`.

Given these points, we can determine the required states for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Increase `k` by 1:**
   - Since the loop runs one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1.

2. **Update `_acc`:**
   - `_acc` will be updated as the result of adding `_max` to itself `k` times, modulo `MOD`.

3. **Set `i` to the New Value of `k`:**
   - `i` will be set to the new value of `k`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`_acc` is the result of adding `_max` a total of (k+1) times, modulo `MOD`, `i` is (k+1), `k` is (k+1), `_max` is the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index n-1, `MOD` remains unchanged.**

In a more concise form:

State: **`_acc` is the result of adding `_max` (k+1) times, modulo `MOD`, `i` is (k+1), `k` is (k+1), `_max` is the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index n-1, `MOD` remains unchanged.**
