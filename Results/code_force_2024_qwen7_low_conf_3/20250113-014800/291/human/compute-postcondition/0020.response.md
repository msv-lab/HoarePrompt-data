First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `_acc` is updated to (`_acc + a[0]`) % MOD, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements.

The code snippet is:
```
_acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD
```

Here, `_max` is not defined in the initial state, so it will remain undefined. Let's assume `_max` is some value that will be used in the calculation.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `_acc` is initially set to (`_acc + a[0]`) % MOD.
2. The code snippet updates `_acc` by adding (`_acc + _max`) % MOD to `_acc`.

Since `_max` is not defined, we can represent it as `_max`. The calculation becomes:
```
_acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD
```

This means `_acc` is updated to its current value plus the value of (`_acc + _max`) % MOD.

The output state will be:
- `_acc` is now `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `a` remains a list of integers with at least `k` elements.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`_acc` is `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements.**
