According to the code, the loop condition is based on the variable `i`, and it ranges from 0 to `k-1`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states hold:

- \_acc is \((3A + 3B + (A + 2B) \% \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD}\)
- \_max is B
- MOD is unchanged
- i is k

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`.

Since `k` is unchanged, the value of `_acc` and `_max` remain the same, and `MOD` remains unchanged as well.

State: **\_acc is \((3A + 3B + (A + 2B) \% \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD}\), \_max is B, MOD is unchanged, i is k + 1**
