The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but presumably processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases. The function does not directly return a value within the problem statement, but it processes the test cases and returns results for each based on the given constraints.

Given the constraints and the lack of specific return details in the provided output cases, the function likely returns some form of result for each test case, possibly a list or dictionary containing results for each `n` and `k` pair.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes `n`, `k`, and a list `a`. It returns results for each test case based on the given constraints.**
