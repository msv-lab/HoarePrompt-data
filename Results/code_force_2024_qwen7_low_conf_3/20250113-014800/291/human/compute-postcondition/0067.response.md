Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `_acc` is `_max` % MOD.
   - `_max` is the maximum subarray sum of the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `k` is `(k+1)`.
   - `_sum` is irrelevant.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - The length of the list `a` (which is `n`) must be less than `k`.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `k-1`.

3. **Determine the New Values After the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was initially `n` and the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1` if `n < k-1`. Otherwise, if `n` is already `k-1`, the loop will stop.
   - Given that `k` is updated to `(k+1)` in each iteration, the new value of `k` will be `k + 1`.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `_acc` remains the same as it is `_max` % MOD, and `_max` does not change until a new maximum subarray sum is found.
   - `_sum` is irrelevant and does not change.
   - The length of `a` remains the same, so `n` (which is the length of `a`) must still be less than the new `k`.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `_acc` is `_max` % MOD.
   - `_max` is the maximum subarray sum of the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n + 1` (if `n < k-1`).
   - `k` is `(k + 1)`.
   - `_sum` is irrelevant.
   - `a` is a list of integers, and the length of `a` must be less than the new `k`.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged.

**State:**
**`_acc` is `_max` % MOD, `_max` is the maximum subarray sum of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1` (if `n < k-1`), `k` is `(k + 1)`, `_sum` is irrelevant, `a` is a list of integers, the length of the list `a` (which is `n`) must be less than the new `k`, `MOD` remains unchanged.**
