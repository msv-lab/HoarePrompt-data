The code snippet updates `_sum` to be the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. After that, it updates `_max` to be the maximum of `_max` and `_sum`. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. Initially, `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`.
2. `i` is `k + 3`.

The new value of `_sum` will be:
- `_sum` becomes `max(0, _sum + a[i])`

Then, `_max` is updated to be:
- `_max` becomes `max(_max, _sum)`

Given that `_sum` is initially `max(0, a[1])`, let's denote `_sum` as `S` for simplicity. So, `_sum` becomes `max(0, S + a[i])`.

After updating `_sum`, `_max` is updated to be the maximum of `_max` and `_sum`. Therefore, `_max` will be `max(_max, max(0, S + a[i]))`.

Other variables (`_acc`, `i`, `k`, `_max`, `a`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`_acc` is 0, `i` is `k + 3`, `k` is `k + 1`, `_max` is `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]))`, `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than `k + 3`**.

Output State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is `k + 3`, `k` is `k + 1`, `_max` is `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]))`, `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than `k + 3`**.
