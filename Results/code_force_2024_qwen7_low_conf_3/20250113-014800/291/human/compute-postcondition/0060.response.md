According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:

- `_acc` is 0
- `i` is `k + 3`
- `k` is `k + 1`
- `_max` is `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]))`
- `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i])`
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element
- `n` must be greater than `k + 3`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state as follows:

1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `k + 4`.
2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `k + 4`.

The values of `_acc`, `_max`, `_sum`, and `a` do not change within the loop based on the information given, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is `k + 4`, `k` is `k + 1`, `_max` is `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]))`, `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than `k + 4`**
