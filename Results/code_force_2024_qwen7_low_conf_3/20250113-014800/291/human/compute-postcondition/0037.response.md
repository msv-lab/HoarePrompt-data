First, let's break down the initial state and the given code:

- `_acc` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `k` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input()
- `_sum` is `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`
- `_max` is the larger of `a[0]` and `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`
- `n` must be at least 2

The code snippet is:
```python
_sum = max(0, _sum + a[i])
```

Now, let's analyze this step by step:

1. `_sum` is initially defined as `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`.
2. The code updates `_sum` by adding `a[i]` (where `i` is 2) and taking the maximum of 0 and the resulting sum.

Since `i` is 2, the code becomes:
```python
_sum = max(0, _sum + a[2])
```

Given that `_sum` is initially `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`, we substitute this into the equation:
```python
_sum = max(0, max(0, a[0] + a[1]) + a[2])
```

To summarize the changes:
- `_sum` is updated to `max(0, max(0, a[0] + a[1]) + a[2])`
- The values of `i`, `k`, `a`, `_max`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **_acc is 0, i is 2, k is 0, a is a list of integers obtained from input(), _sum is max(0, max(0, a[0] + a[1]) + a[2]), _max is the larger of a[0] and max(0, a[0] + a[1]), n is at least 2**
