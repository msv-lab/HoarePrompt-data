To determine the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the structure of the loop.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `_acc` is 0
  - `i` is 0
  - `k` is 0
  - The result of `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD` is printed

- **Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for _ in range(int(input())):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs based on the input value provided by `int(input())`.
   - This means the loop will run until the user inputs a number of iterations.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `_acc` is 0 (accumulated sum of elements from list `a`)
   - `i` is 0 (index or some other counter, but it doesn't directly influence the loop condition)
   - `k` is 0 (another counter or variable, but it doesn't directly influence the loop condition)
   - The result of `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD` was printed.

3. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide another input value for the number of iterations.
   - The variables `_acc`, `i`, and `k` will reset or be re-initialized for the new iteration.
   - Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input()))`, the loop will execute once for each integer input provided by the user.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `_acc` will be reset to 0 because we are starting a new iteration.
   - `i` will be reset to 0 for the new iteration.
   - `k` will be reset to 0 for the new iteration.
   - The result of `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD` will be calculated and printed for the new input.

### Final Answer:
State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, the result of `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD` is printed** (This state will be the same as the initial state since the values reset for the new iteration)

However, to properly reflect the state just before the new iteration starts, the final state should be:

State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, waiting for the next input to determine the number of iterations** 

But if we strictly follow the format and consider the variables that need adjustment for the loop to execute again:

State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, the result of `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD` is printed**
