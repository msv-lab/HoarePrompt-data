Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `_acc` is the result of adding `_max ((k+1)+1)` times, modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is `(k+1)`.
- `k` is `(k+1)`.
- `_max` is `0`.
- `_sum` is `0`.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `MOD` remains unchanged.
- The loop statement is: `for i in range(n):`

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n)` means that the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `_acc` is calculated as `_max ((k+1)+1)` times, modulo `MOD`. Given `_max` is `0`, `_acc` will be `0` because any number multiplied by `0` is `0`.
   - `i` is set to `(k+1)`. Since `k` is `(k+1)`, `i` will be `k+1+1 = k+2`.
   - `k` is `(k+1)`, so `k` is an integer value that is `1` more than its initial value.

3. **List `a`**: `a` is a list of integers input by the user. The loop will iterate over this list, so `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted States:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1`.
- The values of `_acc`, `i`, `k`, `_max`, `_sum`, and `a` do not directly affect the loop execution based on the provided information.

### Final Answer:
State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is `k+2`, `k` is `k+1`, `_max` is 0, `_sum` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` must be at least 1, `MOD` remains unchanged**.
