Output State: **_acc is 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index `n-1`, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` encountered during the loop execution, `n` is the length of the list `a`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` from index 0 to `n-1`.
- `_sum` keeps track of the cumulative sum starting from the beginning of the array up to the current index, resetting to 0 if `_sum` becomes negative.
- `_max` keeps track of the maximum value of `_sum` encountered during the loop execution.
- After the loop completes, `_sum` will hold the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to the last element, and `_max` will be the maximum value of `_sum` encountered during the loop.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), then:
- `_acc` remains 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `_sum` is 0.
- `_max` is 0.
- `n` is 0.
