According to the given for loop, the loop will execute if the variable `i` (which is initially set to `n`) is less than `k`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Initial Value of `i`:** The problem states that `i` is initially `n`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `k`.
2. **Value of `n`:** Since `i` is initially set to `n`, `n` (the length of the list `a`) must be less than `k` for the loop to execute.

The other variables (`_acc`, `_max`, `_sum`, `a`, `k`, and `MOD`) do not directly influence the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, we need to adjust the initial values of `i` and `n` such that the loop condition `i < k` is satisfied.

State: **`_acc` is 0, `_max` is the maximum subarray sum of the list `a`, `i` is `n` (which must be less than `k`), `k` is \((k+1)\), `_sum` is irrelevant, `a` is a list of integers, the length of the list `a` (which is `n`) must be less than `k`, `MOD` remains unchanged.**
