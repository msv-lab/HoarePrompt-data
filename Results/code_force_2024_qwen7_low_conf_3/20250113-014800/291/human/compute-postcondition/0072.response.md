The code snippet prints the sum of `a` (which is not defined in the initial state) plus `_acc` modulo `MOD`. Since `a` is not defined, its sum cannot be calculated, and the code will raise an error. However, based on the provided initial state, we can proceed with the known values.

Here's the breakdown:
- `_acc` is given as `((2^k * (A + (A + B) % M) + k * B) % MOD)`
- `_max` is `B`
- `MOD` is `M`
- `i` is `k`

Since `a` is not defined, the sum of `a` cannot be computed. The code will attempt to print `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD`, which will raise a TypeError due to the undefined `a`.

Given this, the output state is:
Output State: **TypeError: 'sum' of unsuited type**
