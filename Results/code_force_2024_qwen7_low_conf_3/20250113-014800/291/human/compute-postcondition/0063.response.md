Let's analyze the given loop step by step and determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `_acc` is the result of adding `_max` \((k+1)+1\) times, modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is \((k+1)\).
- `k` is \((k+1)\).
- `_max` is \(0\).
- `_sum` is \(0\).
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `MOD` remains unchanged.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(n):
    _sum = max(0, _sum + a[i])
    _max = max(_max, _sum)
```

### Analysis of Loop Iterations
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `i` becomes `k + 2`.
   - `_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[0])`.
   - `_max` is updated to `max(_max, _sum)`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `i` becomes `k + 3`.
   - `_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[1])`.
   - `_max` is updated to `max(_max, _sum)`.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `i` becomes `k + 4`.
   - `_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[2])`.
   - `_max` is updated to `max(_max, _sum)`.

From these iterations, we observe that:
- `_sum` keeps track of the maximum subarray sum ending at the current index.
- `_max` keeps track of the maximum subarray sum encountered so far.

### Final Output State
After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions hold:
- `i` will be `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, and the last iteration sets `i` to `n`.
- `k` remains \((k+1)\) because it is not modified inside the loop.
- `_max` will contain the maximum subarray sum of the list `a`.
- `_sum` will contain the subarray sum at the last index, which is irrelevant for `_max`.

The value of `_acc` is derived from `_max` and is computed as follows:
- `_acc` is the result of adding `_max` \((k+1)+1\) times, modulo `MOD`.

### Final Output State
**Output State:**
- `_acc` is the result of adding `_max` \((k+1)+1\) times, modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `k` is \((k+1)\).
- `_max` is the maximum subarray sum of the list `a`.
- `_sum` is irrelevant and does not affect the final output.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `MOD` remains unchanged.

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: **_acc is the result of adding `_max` \((k+1)+1\) times, modulo `MOD`; i is `n`; k is \((k+1)\); _max is the maximum subarray sum of the list `a`; _sum is irrelevant; a is a list of integers; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `MOD` remains unchanged.**
