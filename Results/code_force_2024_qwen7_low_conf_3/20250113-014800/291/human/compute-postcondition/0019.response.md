Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `_acc` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements.
   - `_acc` is updated to (`_acc + _max`) % MOD, where `_max` is the maximum element in the sublist `a[0:i+1]` and MOD is an unspecified modulus value.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.
   - At the end of each iteration, `_acc` is updated to include the current maximum element in the sublist `a[0:i+1]`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `_acc` is 0 (unchanged from the initial state).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` remains a positive integer.
   - `a` remains a list of integers with at least `k` elements.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented to 1.
   - `_acc` will be updated based on the maximum element in the sublist `a[0:1]` (i.e., the first element of `a`).

5. **Updated States:**
   - `_acc` will be updated to include the first element of `a` if it is the maximum in the sublist.
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer and the condition for the loop to continue is `i < k`.

6. **Final State Before Next Iteration:**
   - `_acc` will be updated to (`_acc + a[0]`) % MOD, where `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `k` remains a positive integer.
   - `a` remains a list of integers with at least `k` elements.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`_acc` is updated to (`_acc + a[0]`) % MOD, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements.**
