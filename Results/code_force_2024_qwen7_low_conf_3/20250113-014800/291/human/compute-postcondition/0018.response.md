Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and converts it to a string `s`. It then iterates through the digits of `s` to find the smallest index `i` where the digit is less than '5'. If such a digit is found, it sets `res` to this index `i` and breaks out of the loop. If no such digit is found, `res` remains -1. Finally, the function returns `res`. The possible values for `res` are either the index of the smallest digit in `s` that is less than '5' or `n` itself if no such digit exists. This covers all edge cases including when `n` is a single-digit number (since converting it to a string will have only one character).**
