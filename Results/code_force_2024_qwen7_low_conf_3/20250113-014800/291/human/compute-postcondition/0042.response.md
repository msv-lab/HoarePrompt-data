The code `_acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD` updates the value of `_acc`. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. `_acc + _max` is computed.
2. The result of `_acc + _max` is taken modulo `MOD`.
3. The resulting value is added to `_acc`.

Let's denote the initial value of `_acc` as `A` and the initial value of `_max` as `B`, and assume `MOD` is a constant.

After the operation:
- `_acc` becomes `A + (A + B) % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **_acc is A + (A + B) % MOD, _max is B, MOD is unchanged**
