The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigns the resulting list to `a`. However, the specific values of `a` depend on the input provided by the user. The variables `_acc`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Since no specific input is given, we can represent the output in a general form:

Output State: **_acc is 0, i is 0, k is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input()**
