The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input using `map` and `int`. This operation affects the values of `_acc`, `i`, and `k`, which are no longer relevant after this input. The values of `_max` and `MOD` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `_acc` remains the result of adding `_max` (k+1) times, modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is now `(k+1)`.
- `k` is now `(k+1)`.
- `_max` remains the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index n-1.
- `MOD` remains unchanged.

Output State: **_acc is the result of adding _max ((k+1)+1) times, modulo MOD; i is (k+1); k is (k+1); _max is the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index n-1; MOD remains unchanged.**
