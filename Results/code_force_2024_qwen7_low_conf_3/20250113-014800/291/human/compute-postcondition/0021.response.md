According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `k` remains a positive integer.

The state adjustments are as follows:
- `_acc` remains `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`.
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `a` remains a list of integers with at least `k` elements.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`_acc` is `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`, `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements.**
