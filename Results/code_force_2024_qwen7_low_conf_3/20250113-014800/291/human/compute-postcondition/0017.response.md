The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns `res`, which is the index of the smallest digit in `s` that is less than '5', or `n` if no such digit exists.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return the index of the smallest digit in `s` that is less than '5', or `n` if no such digit exists.
