The code `_acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD` updates the value of `_acc`. Here, `_acc` is added to `_max` modulo `MOD`, and the result is then added back to `_acc`.

Let's denote the initial value of `_acc` as `A` and the initial value of `_max` as `B`, and the value of `MOD` as `M`.

The updated value of `_acc` will be:
\[ \text{new\_}_\text{acc} = A + (A + B) \% M \]

So, the output state will be:
Output State: **`_acc` is equal to `(A + (A + B) % M)`; `_max` is `B`; `MOD` is `M`**
