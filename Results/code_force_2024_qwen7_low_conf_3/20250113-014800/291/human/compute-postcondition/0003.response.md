Postcondition: **`total` is -1, `i` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), and the current value of `s[i]` is less than '5'**
