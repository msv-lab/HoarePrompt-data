According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `_acc` is equal to `(A + (A + B) % M)`
- `_max` is `B`
- `MOD` is `M`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `k`.

Therefore, the new state will be:
- `_acc` remains the same: equal to `(A + (A + B) % M)`
- `_max` remains the same: `B`
- `MOD` remains the same: `M`
- `i` is incremented by 1

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we express it as `i + 1 < k`.

State: **`_acc` is equal to `(A + (A + B) % M)`, `_max` is `B`, `MOD` is `M`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i + 1 < k`**
