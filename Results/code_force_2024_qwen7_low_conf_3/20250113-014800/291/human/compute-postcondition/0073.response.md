Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `MOD` = 10, `_acc` is the cumulative sum of _max (mod MOD) over k iterations, `_max` is the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index n-1, the final result is `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case involves reading new values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.
   - `_sum` and `_max` are updated within the first for loop to find the maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index `n-1`.
   - `_acc` is the cumulative sum of `_max` (mod `MOD`) over `k` iterations.

2. **First Loop (`for i in range(n)`)**:
   - `_sum` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of `_sum` and `a[i]`.
   - `_max` is updated to be the maximum of `_max` and `_sum`.

3. **Second Loop (`for i in range(k)`)**:
   - `_acc` is updated by adding `(prev_acc + _max) % MOD` to itself, where `prev_acc` is the previous value of `_acc` and `_max` is the maximum subarray sum.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the final result for each test case is `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD`.

### Summary of Variables After All Iterations:
- `t`: Number of test cases.
- `n`, `k`: Positive integers representing the size of the list `a` and the number of iterations for the second loop, respectively.
- `a`: List of `n` integers.
- `MOD`: Constant value of 10.
- `_acc`: Cumulative sum of `_max` (mod `MOD`) over `k` iterations.
- `_max`: Maximum subarray sum starting from the beginning of the array up to index `n-1`.
- The final result for each test case is `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD`.
