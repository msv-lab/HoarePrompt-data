The code updates `_max` to be the maximum of its current value and `_sum`. Let's analyze the values:

- Initially, `_acc` is 0.
- `i` is `k + 4`.
- `k` is `k + 1`.
- `_max` is calculated as `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]))`.
- `_sum` is calculated as `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]) + a[i]`.

After executing `_max = max(_max, _sum)`, `_max` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and `_sum`. Since `_sum` is already calculated and is the sum of `_max` (or a part of it) and another element from the list, `_max` will be updated to `_sum` because `_sum` is guaranteed to be greater or equal due to the way `_sum` is defined.

Therefore, the new value of `_max` will be `_sum`.

Output State: **_acc is 0, i is k + 4, k is k + 1, _max is max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]) + a[i), _sum is max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]) + a[i]**.
