Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `_acc` is `A + (A + B) % MOD`.
   - `_max` is `B`.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged.
   - The loop runs for `k` iterations with `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
   - At each iteration, `i` increases by `1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `_acc` is already updated to the value after the previous iteration.
   - `_max` is already updated to the value after the previous iteration.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `k-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `k` (the next value in the range `range(k)`).

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `_acc` and `_max` will be updated based on the loop body, but since we don't have the exact loop body, we assume they remain as they were after the previous iteration.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged.
   - `i` will be incremented to `k`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `_acc` is still `A + (A + B) % MOD`.
   - `_max` is still `B`.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **_acc is A + (A + B) % MOD, _max is B, MOD is unchanged, i is k**
