Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have executed.

### Initial State
- `_acc` is equal to `(A + (A + B) % M)`
- `_max` is `B`
- `MOD` is `M`
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is `(k + 1)`
- `i < k`

### Loop Code
```
for i in range(k):
    _acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD
```

### Analysis

#### Step 1: Understanding the Loop
The loop runs `k` times, incrementing `i` from `0` to `k-1`. In each iteration, `_acc` is updated as follows:
- `_acc` is updated to `(_acc + _acc + _max) % MOD`

#### Step 2: Simplifying the Update Expression
- Initially, `_acc` is `(A + (A + B) % M)`
- In each iteration, `_acc` is updated to `((2 * _acc + _max) % MOD)`

#### Step 3: Final Value of `_acc`
To find the final value of `_acc` after `k` iterations, we need to observe the pattern of updates.

Let's denote the initial value of `_acc` as `_acc_initial = (A + (A + B) % M)`. After `k` iterations, `_acc` will be:
- `_acc_k = (((...(((2 * _acc_initial + _max) % MOD) + _max) % MOD) + ... + _max) % MOD)`

This can be simplified as:
- `_acc_k = ((2^k * _acc_initial + k * _max) % MOD)`

Since the loop runs `k` times, the final value of `_acc` after `k` iterations is:
- `_acc` is `((2^k * (A + (A + B) % M) + k * B) % MOD)`

#### Step 4: Values of Other Variables
- `_max` remains `B` throughout the loop.
- `MOD` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be `k`.
- `k` remains unchanged.

### Output State

If the loop executes `k` times, the final values of the variables are:
- `_acc` is `((2^k * (A + (A + B) % M) + k * B) % MOD)`
- `_max` is `B`
- `MOD` is `M`
- `i` is `k`
- `k` remains unchanged

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `i >= k` initially), the values of the variables remain:
- `_acc` is `(A + (A + B) % M)`
- `_max` is `B`
- `MOD` is `M`
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is `(k + 1)`

### Final Output State
Output State: **`_acc` is `((2^k * (A + (A + B) % M) + k * B) % MOD)`, `_max` is `B`, `MOD` is `M`, `i` is `k`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
