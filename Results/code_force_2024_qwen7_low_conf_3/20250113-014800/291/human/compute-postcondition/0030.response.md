To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the structure of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `_acc` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input()
- `_sum` is 0
- `_max` is 0

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the `range(n)`**: The `for i in range(n)` loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute even once, `n` must be at least 1.
   
2. **Initial Values of Variables**: The initial values of `_acc`, `i`, `k`, `_sum`, and `_max` do not directly affect the loop's execution. However, since `i` is initially set to 0, the loop will start iterating when `i` reaches 1 (or higher) based on the value of `n`.

3. **List `a`**: The list `a` is obtained from user input, but its contents do not affect whether the loop can execute. It just needs to exist as a valid list.

### Required Adjustments:
To ensure the loop can execute, the only state adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

### Final State:
State: **`_acc` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
