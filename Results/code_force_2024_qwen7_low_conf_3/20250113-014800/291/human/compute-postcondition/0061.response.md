First, let's break down the initial state:
- `_acc` is 0
- `i` is `k + 4`
- `k` is `k + 1`
- `_max` is `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]))`
- `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i])`
- `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element
- `n` must be greater than `k + 4`

The code snippet modifies `_sum` as follows:
```
_sum = max(0, _sum + a[i])
```

To proceed, let's substitute the value of `_sum` from the initial state into the code snippet:
- `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i])`
- Therefore, `_sum + a[i]` becomes `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]) + a[i]`

Now, let's take the maximum of 0 and this expression:
- `_sum` will become `max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]) + a[i])`

Given the above, the only updated variable is `_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.

Output State: **_acc is 0, i is k + 4, k is k + 1, _max is max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i])), _sum is max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[i]) + a[i], a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, n must be greater than k + 4**
