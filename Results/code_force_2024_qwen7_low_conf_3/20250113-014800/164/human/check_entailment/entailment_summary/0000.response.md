Reasoning:

1. The program correctly parses the input values for each test case.
2. The `graph` is constructed properly using the given passages.
3. The BFS algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path from platform 1 (index 0) to platform n (index n-1).
4. The BFS algorithm correctly checks the current level of each platform and updates it based on the changes specified in the `changes` list.
5. The BFS ensures that only valid moves (same level) are considered during each step.
6. The BFS returns the minimum number of steps required to reach the target platform or -1 if it's not possible.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
