Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform n, considering the changing levels of platforms.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs a graph where nodes represent platforms, and edges represent passages between platforms with the same level.

2. **Level Update**: After each step, the levels of the platforms are updated according to the rules specified in the problem statement.

3. **BFS Traversal**: The BFS traversal ensures that the shortest path is found in terms of the number of steps, taking into account the changing levels.

4. **Visited Set**: The `visited` set ensures that states are not revisited, which helps in avoiding cycles and redundant computations.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it should handle all the test cases correctly as long as the input adheres to the constraints provided. The BFS algorithm is well-suited for finding the shortest path in such scenarios, and the level update mechanism ensures that the correct transitions are made.

Since the program handles the core logic accurately and efficiently, and there are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
