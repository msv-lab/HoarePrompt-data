Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure its correctness.

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program correctly constructs a graph using the `passages` list, where each platform is represented as a node and each passage as an edge.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Level Update**:
   - The levels of the platforms are updated correctly using the formula \( l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H \).
   - This part is also correct and follows the problem requirements.

3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - The BFS traversal starts from platform 0 (platform 1 in the problem description) and searches for the shortest path to platform `n-1`.
   - The BFS ensures that the minimum number of steps is found by exploring the shortest paths first.
   - The use of a `deque` for the queue and the `visited` set to avoid revisiting states is appropriate and helps in efficiently finding the shortest path.

4. **Handling Initial State**:
   - The initial state of the BFS is correctly set to \((0, levels[0])\), meaning it starts from platform 0 with its initial level.
   - This is consistent with the problem requirement to start from platform 1 (which corresponds to index 0 in the list).

5. **Checking for Valid Moves**:
   - The program correctly checks if the current platform and the next platform have the same level before adding the next state to the queue.
   - This ensures that only valid moves are considered, aligning with the problem constraints.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no path is found by returning `-1` if the target platform cannot be reached.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and aligns with the problem description and constraints. The function summary provided accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
