You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a game where you need to move through a labyrinth. The labyrinth
consists of n platforms, connected by m passages.

Each platform is at some level l_i , an integer number from 0 to H - 1 . In a
single step, if you are currently on platform i , you can stay on it, or move
to another platform j . To move to platform j they have to be connected by the
passage, and their levels have to be the same, namely l_i = l_j .

After each step, the levels of all platforms change. The new level of platform
i is calculated as l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H , for all i .

You start on platform 1 . Find the minimum number of steps you need to get to
platform n .

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and H (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m \le 10^5 , 1 \le H \le 10^9 ).

The second line contains n integers l_i , the initial level of each platform
(0 \le l_i \le H-1 ).

The third line contains n integers s_i , the change of level for each platform
(0 \le s_i \le H-1 ).

Next m lines contain a description of the passages. Each passage is described
as a pair of integers — the platforms, connected by the passage. There is at
most one passage connecting each pair of platforms, and there is no passage
connecting a platform to itself.

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^5 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the minimum number of steps needed
to get from platform 1 to platform n .

If it is impossible to get to platform n , print -1 .

Note

This is how levels of the platforms change, and what actions we need to
perform in the first example.

| Platform 1| Platform 2| Platform 3| Action  
---|---|---|---|---  
Step 1| 1| 9| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 2| 3| 2| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 3| 5| 5| 4| Move to the platform 2  
Step 4| 7| 8| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 5| 9| 1| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 6| 1| 4| 4| Move to the platform 3

                if next_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_state)
                    queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts the parameters `n`, `m`, `H`, `levels`, `changes`, and `passages`. It constructs a graph representation of the platforms and their connections. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum number of steps required to travel from the first platform (platform 0) to the last platform (platform `n-1`). During the BFS, it considers the current level of each platform and updates it based on the changes specified in the `changes` list. If a path from the first platform to the last platform is found, the function returns the number of steps taken. If no such path exists, the function returns `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform n in terms of the number of steps required, considering the changes in platform levels over time.

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs a graph where each node represents a platform, and edges represent passages between platforms. This part is correct.
2. **Queue Initialization**: A queue is initialized with the starting node (platform 1) and the initial state of its level.
3. **State Representation**: Each state in the BFS is represented as a tuple `(current_platform, current_level)`. This is necessary because the state also depends on the current level of the platform, which changes over time.
4. **Visited Set**: A set `visited` is used to keep track of visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times. This ensures that the BFS does not get stuck in a loop due to changing levels.
5. **BFS Loop**: The BFS loop correctly processes nodes and checks if the target node (platform n-1) has been reached. If the target node is reached, the function returns the number of steps taken to reach it.
6. **Level Update**: After processing a node, the level of the current platform is updated according to the problem statement. This update is done correctly within the BFS loop.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it appears to handle the problem correctly, taking into account the changing levels of platforms and ensuring that the BFS finds the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.
