### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the given problem description and function summary.

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program correctly constructs a graph using the `passages` information, where each platform is a node, and each passage is an edge.
   - This part is accurate and correctly handles the graph construction.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - The queue is initialized with the starting node (platform 0, since the problem states "platform 1" but the indexing starts from 0 in Python).
   - The initial state is set correctly as `(0, levels[0])`, representing the starting platform and its initial level.

3. **State Representation**:
   - The state `(current_platform, current_level)` is used to ensure that the BFS takes into account the changing levels of platforms.
   - This is crucial because the allowed movements depend on the levels being the same.

4. **Visited Set**:
   - The `visited` set is used to avoid revisiting states, which helps prevent infinite loops in the BFS.
   - This is correct and ensures that the algorithm does not get stuck.

5. **BFS Loop**:
   - The BFS loop correctly processes nodes and checks if the target node (platform `n-1`) has been reached.
   - When the target node is reached, the function returns the number of steps taken to reach it.
   - This is handled correctly.

6. **Level Update**:
   - After processing a node, the level of the current platform is updated according to the problem statement: `levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
   - This update is done correctly within the BFS loop.

7. **Handling No Path**:
   - If the BFS completes without finding the target node, the function correctly returns `-1`.
   - This handles the case where no path exists.

8. **Indexing Issue**:
   - One potential issue is the index handling. The program starts BFS from platform 0 instead of platform 1 as stated in the problem description.
   - This is a minor issue but could lead to confusion. However, since the problem description mentions "platform 1", this should be adjusted to `1` instead of `0`.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the above analysis, the program is generally correct in its approach and implementation. The only minor issue is the index handling, which should be corrected to align with the problem description.

**Final: True**

The program correctly implements the BFS to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform n, considering the changing levels of platforms. The minor issue with index handling can be fixed, but it does not affect the overall correctness of the program.
