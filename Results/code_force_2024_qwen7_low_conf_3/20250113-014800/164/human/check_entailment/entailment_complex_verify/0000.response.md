### Reasoning

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
   - The graph is constructed correctly, and the BFS setup is appropriate.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each node (platform) points to other nodes (platforms) that it can connect to.
   - This representation is correct and efficient for the BFS traversal.

3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - The BFS starts from platform 0 (since the input specifies starting from platform 1, but the graph index is zero-based).
   - The BFS visits each platform only once, ensuring that cycles are avoided.
   - The program checks if the current platform and the next platform have the same level before considering the next platform for the BFS queue.
   - The level update is done correctly using modular arithmetic.

4. **Visited Set**:
   - The `visited` set keeps track of the states that have already been processed, preventing redundant computations and infinite loops.
   - This is crucial for handling the changing levels correctly and ensuring that the BFS finds the shortest path.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where it is impossible to reach platform `n-1` by checking if the BFS completes without reaching the target platform.
   - If no path is found, the program returns `-1`.

6. **Final Check**:
   - The program updates the levels of platforms correctly and ensures that the BFS continues until the target platform is reached or determined unreachable.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented and handles all the requirements specified in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that would make the program incorrect.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed reasoning and the annotations provided, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Final: True**
