### Reasoning:

The provided program indeed uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to solve the problem, and the logic seems correct based on the annotated code. Let's break down the key aspects of the program:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs a graph where each node represents a platform, and edges represent passages between platforms. This is done using the `passages` list.

2. **Queue Initialization**: The queue is initialized with the starting node (platform 1) and its initial state (level).

3. **State Representation**: Each state in the BFS is represented as a tuple `(current_platform, current_level)`. This is crucial because the state also depends on the current level of the platform, which changes over time. This representation ensures that the BFS can track the correct sequence of states.

4. **Visited Set**: A set `visited` is used to keep track of visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times. This helps prevent the BFS from getting stuck in a loop due to the changing levels of platforms.

5. **BFS Loop**: The BFS loop correctly processes nodes and checks if the target node (platform n-1) has been reached. If the target node is reached, the function returns the number of steps taken to reach it.

6. **Level Update**: After processing a node, the level of the current platform is updated according to the problem statement. This update is done correctly within the BFS loop, ensuring that the BFS considers the correct levels when making decisions.

The BFS approach is well-suited for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of steps, considering the changing levels of platforms. The program correctly handles the state transitions and ensures that it does not revisit the same state unnecessarily.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it appears to handle the problem correctly, taking into account the changing levels of platforms and ensuring that the BFS finds the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of steps required to move from platform 1 to platform n, considering the changing levels of platforms.

**Final: True**
