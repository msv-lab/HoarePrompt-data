Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Graph Construction**: 
   - The program constructs a graph using the passages provided. Each platform \(i\) is represented as a node, and edges are added between nodes that are connected by passages with the same level.
   
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - A BFS is used to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform \(n\). The BFS starts from platform 1, and for each platform, it checks if there are any adjacent platforms at the same level. If such a platform is found, the program moves to it and updates the level accordingly.
   - The BFS ensures that the program finds the minimum number of steps required to reach platform \(n\).

3. **Level Update**:
   - After each move, the levels of all platforms are updated according to the rules specified in the problem description. Specifically, the level of a platform \(i\) is updated as \(l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \mod H\).

4. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The BFS continues until it either reaches platform \(n\) or exhausts all possible paths without reaching it. If the program reaches platform \(n\), it returns the number of steps taken. If it exhausts all possibilities without reaching platform \(n\), it returns \(-1\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where it is impossible to reach platform \(n\) by checking if the BFS completes without finding a path to platform \(n\).

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It uses BFS to find the shortest path, updates levels according to the given rules, and handles all necessary conditions and edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
