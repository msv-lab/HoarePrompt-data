### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs the graph using the provided passages, ensuring that each passage connects nodes with the same level.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The BFS is implemented correctly. It starts from the initial platform (node 0) and uses a queue to explore the graph level by level. This ensures that the shortest path is found in terms of the number of steps.

3. **Level Update**: The levels of the platforms are updated correctly using the formula \( l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H \). This ensures that the BFS always operates on the correct current state of the platform levels.

4. **Visited Set**: The visited set is used correctly to avoid revisiting nodes, which prevents cycles and ensures that the BFS finds the shortest path.

5. **Termination Condition**: The program correctly checks if the current platform matches the target platform (node \( n-1 \)). If it does, it returns the number of steps taken.

6. **No Path Case**: If the BFS completes without finding a path to the target platform, the program correctly returns -1.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:

**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of steps required to move from platform 1 to platform \( n \) in the given labyrinth game, considering the constraints and rules provided.
