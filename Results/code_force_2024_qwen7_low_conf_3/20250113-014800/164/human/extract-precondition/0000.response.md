Precondition: **num_platforms is a positive integer such that 2 <= num_platforms <= 10^5; num_passages is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_passages <= 10^5; max_level is a positive integer such that 1 <= max_level <= 10^9; levels is a list of num_platforms integers where each element is between 0 and H-1 inclusive; changes is a list of num_platforms integers where each element is between 0 and H-1 inclusive; passages is a list of num_passages tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indices of the platforms connected by a passage (indices are 1-based).**
