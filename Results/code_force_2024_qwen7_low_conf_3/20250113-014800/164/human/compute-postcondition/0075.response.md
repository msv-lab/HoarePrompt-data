`queue` appends a tuple containing the `next_platform` and `steps + 1`. The `next_platform` is derived from `next_state[0]`, and `steps + 1` is the sum of the current `steps` and 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is the leftmost element's second value + 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and `next_state` is in `visited`**
