Postcondition: ***`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is either \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\), and `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element, provided that `next_state` is not in `visited`. If `next_state` is already in `visited`, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
