Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Initial States**: We start with the following states:
   - `levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
   - `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()` (this means `current_platform` has changed).
   - `steps` remains unchanged.
   - `graph` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are platforms in `graph[current_platform]` (i.e., the list of adjacent platforms is not empty).

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `graph[current_platform]` is not empty. If `graph[current_platform]` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Final States**: After the loop, the states remain the same except for the possible update in `current_platform` inside the loop body. However, since we are asked to adjust the state before the loop, we only need to ensure the condition under which the loop can start.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `graph[current_platform]` must not be an empty list.

State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged, and `graph[current_platform]` must not be an empty list**.
