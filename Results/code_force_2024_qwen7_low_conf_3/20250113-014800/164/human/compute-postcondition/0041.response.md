The code `current_platform, steps = queue.popleft()` removes the first element from the queue and assigns it to `current_platform` and `steps` respectively. Since the queue was non-empty, removing an element will make it non-empty afterward. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue before `.popleft()`, `steps` is the second element of the queue before `.popleft()`, `queue` is non-empty (it has at least one element), `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged**
