The code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that `next_platform` is added to the queue along with the incremented value of `steps`.

- The value of `current_platform` is updated to the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, which removes the first element from the queue.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `next_platform` is added to the queue.

The other variables (`levels`, `changes`, `H`, `graph`, `next_state`, and `visited`) remain unchanged.

To summarize:

- `current_platform` is now the `next_platform` that was previously in the queue before `.popleft()`.
- `steps` is now one more than its original value.
- `next_platform` is now part of the queue with the incremented steps count.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `levels[next_platform]` is updated to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is added to `visited`, `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element.**
