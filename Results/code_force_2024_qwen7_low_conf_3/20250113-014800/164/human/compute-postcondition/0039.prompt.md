You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over each `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`. For each iteration, the following conditions are checked and actions are taken:

1. **Condition Check**: The current platform's level (`levels[current_platform]`) is compared with the next platform's level (`levels[next_platform]`). If they are equal, the player can move to the next platform.
2. **State Calculation**: If the player moves to the next platform, the new level is calculated as `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.
3. **Visited Check**: The `next_state` (which is the tuple `(next_platform, new level)`) is checked against the `visited` set.
4. **Queue Update**: If `next_state` is not in `visited`, it is added to both the `visited` set and the `queue`.

### Understanding the Output States
From the provided output states, we can infer the following:

- **After 1 iteration**: `current_platform` remains the same, `steps` is either 0 or 1, and the queue may include a new tuple `(current_platform, steps + 1)`.
- **After 2 iterations**: `current_platform` remains the same, `steps` can be 0, 1, or 2, and the queue may include new tuples based on the conditions met.
- **After 3 iterations**: Similar to the previous, `current_platform` remains the same, `steps` can be 1 or 2, and the queue may include new tuples.

### Final Output State
Since the loop continues to execute until there are no more valid moves (i.e., no unvisited next platforms), the final state will be:

- **Current Platform**: The `current_platform` will be the last platform the player reached.
- **Steps**: The `steps` will be the total number of moves made to reach the final platform.
- **New Level**: The new level of the player will be `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
- **Graph and Queue**: The `graph` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The `queue` will be empty since all valid moves have been processed.

### Output State
Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

**Output State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is a non-negative integer representing the total number of moves made, the new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `graph` remains unchanged, and `queue` is an empty deque.
```
levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[
    current_platform]) % H

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
