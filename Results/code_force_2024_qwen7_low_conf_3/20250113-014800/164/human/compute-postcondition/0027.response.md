The code `next_state = next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H` does the following:

1. It assigns `next_platform` to the first element of `next_state`.
2. It calculates `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H` and assigns it to the second element of `next_state`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`.
- `steps` is either 0 or 1.
- The new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
- `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element.
- `queue` remains unchanged.

However, the code does not explicitly define what `next_platform` is, nor does it modify `current_platform`, `steps`, `levels`, `changes`, `H`, or `queue`. The only change is to the variable `next_state`.

Therefore, `next_state` is assigned a tuple containing two elements:
- The first element is `next_platform`.
- The second element is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 0 or 1, the new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, `queue` remains unchanged, `next_state` is (`next_platform`, `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`)**
