Postcondition: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged, `levels[next_platform]` is equal to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, `graph[current_platform]` must not be an empty list, and `next_state` is not in `visited`.**
