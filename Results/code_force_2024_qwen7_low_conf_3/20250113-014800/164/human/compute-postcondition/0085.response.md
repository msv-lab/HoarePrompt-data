Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `current_platform` is the next platform, `steps` is incremented by 1, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), and if `next_state` is in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple (next_platform, steps + 1), otherwise `queue` remains unchanged.**
