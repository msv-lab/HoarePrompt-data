Postcondition: ***`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged. If `current_platform` equals `n - 1`, the function returns `steps`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything and continues executing the next statements in the program.***
