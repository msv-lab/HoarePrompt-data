`current_platform` and `steps` are assigned the values from the front of the deque `queue`. The deques and tuples are collections that can store multiple values, so when we call `popleft()`, the first element is removed from the deque and its values are assigned to `current_platform` and `steps`.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is a positive integer
- `H` is a positive integer
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `levels` is a list of `n` integers
- `changes` is a list of `n` integers
- `passages` is a list of `m` tuples
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists
- `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(0, 0)`
- `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`

After executing `current_platform, steps = queue.popleft()`, the deque `queue` no longer contains the tuple `(0, 0)` because it has been removed. The values of `current_platform` and `steps` are now known to be `0` and `0`, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `levels` is a list of `n` integers, `changes` is a list of `n` integers, `passages` is a list of `m` tuples, `graph` is a list of `n` lists, `queue` is a deque without the tuple (0, 0), `visited` is a set containing the tuple (0, levels[0]), `current_platform` is 0, `steps` is 0**
