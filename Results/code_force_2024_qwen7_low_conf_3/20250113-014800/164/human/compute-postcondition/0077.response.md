Postcondition: ***`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level. If `next_state` is in `visited`, the function proceeds as if `next_state` is already visited; otherwise, `steps` is updated accordingly.***
