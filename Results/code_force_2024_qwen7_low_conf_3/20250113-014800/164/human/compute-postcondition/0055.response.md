The code appends the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the list `queue`. This means the value of `queue` changes, and it now includes the new tuple at its end. The other variables remain unchanged. 

- `levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\)
- `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\)
- `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`
- `steps` is incremented by 1
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `next_state` is now \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\)
- `queue` now contains the last element `(next_platform, steps + 1)`
- `visited` contains `next_state`

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is now \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\), `queue` now contains the last element `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, and `visited` contains `next_state`.**
