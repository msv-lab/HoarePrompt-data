Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `levels` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive, `changes` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive, `passages` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing two distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `graph` is a list of `n` lists where for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `graph[i]` contains all the nodes that are directly connected to node `i+1` via passages.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple `(u, v)` in the `passages` list.
- For each tuple, it adds an edge between `u-1` and `v-1` in the adjacency list representation of the graph.
- After executing the loop, the `graph` list will contain all the direct connections (edges) between nodes based on the `passages` list.
- The `levels` and `changes` lists remain unchanged throughout the loop since they are not modified within the loop.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `m` is 0), then the `graph` list will still be initialized as a list of `n` empty lists, meaning there are no edges in the graph.
