The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), and `b` is an integer such that \(0 \leq b \leq 10^5\). 

For Case_1: If certain conditions are met (not explicitly stated here but implied from the provided cases), the function returns `b` with its original value, 0 for the second element, and 1 for the third element.

For Case_2: If other conditions are met (also not explicitly stated here but implied from the provided cases), the function returns `gcd_val` which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `b % a` and `a`, `x` which is `y1 - b // a * x1`, and `y` which is `x1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return either `b` with specific values for the second and third elements or the GCD of `b % a` and `a`, along with two other integers `x` and `y` based on certain conditions.
