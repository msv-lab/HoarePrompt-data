Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while queue:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the `queue` is not empty.

2. **Current State Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given by `levels[current_platform]' is (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`. This indicates that some computation has been performed on the `current_platform` level, but it doesn't directly relate to the loop condition.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, the `queue` must not be empty. Since the loop is based on the presence of elements in `queue`, we don't need to adjust any state related to the `current_platform` level directly. We just need to ensure that the `queue` still contains at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State**: The only adjustment needed is to ensure that the `queue` is not empty. If the `queue` was empty at the end of the last iteration, the loop would have terminated. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `queue` still contains at least one element for the loop to execute again.

Given this analysis, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`queue` must not be empty**
