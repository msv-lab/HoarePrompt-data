Let's break down the information given and understand the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\)
- `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\)
- `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`
- `steps` is incremented by 1
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `next_state` is added to `visited`
- `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element, provided that `next_state` is not in `visited`.
- The condition `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is not met.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `queue`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Queue Condition**: The loop will continue if the `queue` is not empty. Since the last element of the `queue` is \((next_platform, steps + 1)\), the queue is non-empty.
2. **Next Platform Selection**: The loop iterates over `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.
3. **States to Adjust**:
   - `current_platform` will change to the next platform being processed.
   - `steps` will be incremented by 1 (as the loop body increments it).
   - `next_state` will be added to `visited` during the loop execution.
   - `queue` will be updated with new elements based on the loop body, but since we are focusing on the initial setup, we only need to note that the current state is valid for the loop to continue.

Given that the loop condition is met and the states are consistent, the key states to adjust for the next iteration are:

- `current_platform` will be the next platform in the `graph[current_platform]`.
- `steps` will be incremented by 1.
- `next_state` will be added to `visited`.
- `queue` will contain the new `(next_platform, steps + 1)` pair if `next_state` is not already in `visited`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is added to `visited`, and `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element, provided that `next_state` is not in `visited`**.
