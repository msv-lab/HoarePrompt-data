Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 0 or 1, the new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, and `queue` contains a new element `(current_platform, steps + 1)` if `current_platform` is equal to `next_platform` and `next_platform` was in `visited`. If `current_platform` is not equal to `next_platform`, `queue` remains unchanged.***
