`visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the set `visited`. The `next_state` is defined as `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. The other variables such as `levels[current_platform]`, `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform`, `steps`, and `next_state` are updated according to the given operations. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and the following updates occur:
- `current_platform` is set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `next_state` is defined as `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `next_state` is added to `visited` as `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`**.
