To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop. The loop continues as long as `queue` is non-empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`
- `current_platform` remains unchanged
- `steps` remains unchanged
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `queue` remains unchanged

The loop condition is `while queue:`. For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must contain at least one element.

Since `queue` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, no adjustment is needed to `queue` itself. However, we need to ensure that the state reflects that `queue` is non-empty for the next iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `queue` is non-empty.

State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged, `queue` is non-empty**
