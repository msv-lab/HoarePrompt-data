`next_state` is assigned the tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. 

- `next_platform` remains the same as its original value.
- `levels[next_platform]` is updated to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.
- The other variables (`current_platform`, `steps`, `graph`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged, `levels[next_platform]` is equal to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, and `graph[current_platform]` must not be an empty list.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged, `levels[next_platform]` is equal to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, and `graph[current_platform]` must not be an empty list.**
