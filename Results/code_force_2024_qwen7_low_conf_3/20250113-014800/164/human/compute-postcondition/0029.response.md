The code appends a tuple containing `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. The previous value of `steps` is either 0 or 1, so after adding 1, `steps + 1` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `current_platform`, `levels`, `changes`, `graph`, `queue`, `next_state`, and `visited` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 1 or 2, the new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, `queue` now includes the tuple `next_platform` and `steps + 1`, `next_state` is (`next_platform`, `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`), `visited` contains the tuple `next_state`**
