The code updates `next_state` to a tuple consisting of `next_platform` and \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\). The other variables remain unchanged.

- `levels[current_platform]` and `levels[next_platform]` are updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\) and \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\) respectively.
- `current_platform` is set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `graph` remains unchanged.
- `next_state` is either \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\).
- `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element, provided that `next_state` is not in `visited`.

After executing the code, the following updates occur:
- `next_state` is updated to \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\).
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `current_platform` is updated to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `next_state` is either \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\)**.
