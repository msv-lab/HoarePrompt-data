The code creates a set named `visited` and adds the tuple `(0, levels[0])` to it. The value of `levels[0]` is a specific integer since `levels` is a list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `levels` is a list of `n` integers, `changes` is a list of `n` integers, `passages` is a list of `m` tuples, `graph` is a list of `n` lists, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (0, 0), `visited` is a set containing the tuple (0, levels[0])**
