The code assigns the value of the tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` to the variable `next_state`. This impacts the variable `next_state`, which now holds the updated tuple based on the given formula. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`.
- `steps` is either 1 or 2.
- The new level of the player is \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\).
- `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element.
- `queue` remains unchanged or includes the tuple `next_platform` and `steps + 1` if `next_state` is not in `visited`.
- `next_state` is \((next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H)\).
- `visited` either remains unchanged or contains the tuple `next_state`.

After executing the code, the following updates occur:
- `next_state` is updated to \((next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H)\).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 1 or 2, the new level of the player is \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, `queue` remains unchanged or includes the tuple `next_platform` and `steps + 1` if `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is \((next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H)\), and `visited` either remains unchanged or contains the tuple `next_state`.**
