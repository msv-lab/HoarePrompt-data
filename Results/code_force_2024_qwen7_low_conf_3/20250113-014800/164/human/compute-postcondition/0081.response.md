The code appends a tuple containing `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. The value of `queue` will now include this new tuple, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` contains its leftmost element and also includes the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and `next_state` is in `visited`.**
