The code `queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))` appends a tuple containing the `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now contains this new tuple. However, the states of the other variables such as `levels[current_platform]`, `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform`, `steps`, and `next_state` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `next_state` is added to `visited` as `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`**.
