The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the set `visited`. This operation does not change the values of `current_platform`, `levels`, `changes`, `steps`, `graph`, or `next_state`. However, it modifies the `visited` set by including `next_state`.

Output State: **`current_platform` is now `next_platform`; the new level of the player is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`; `steps` is 0; `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element; `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`; `next_state` is in `visited`**
