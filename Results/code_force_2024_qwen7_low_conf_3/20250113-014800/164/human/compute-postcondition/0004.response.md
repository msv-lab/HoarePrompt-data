The function `func_1(b % a, a)` is called, and it returns three values: `gcd_val`, `x1`, and `y1`. However, the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of these variables. The only information we can extract is that `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `b % a` and `a`, and `x1` and `y1` are integers that satisfy the equation `x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a = gcd_val`.

The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `H`, `l_i`, `s_i`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `H` is an integer such that \(1 \leq H \leq 10^9\), `l_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq l_i \leq H-1\), `s_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s_i \leq H-1\), `a` is not 0, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `b % a` and `a`, `x1` and `y1` are integers satisfying `x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a = gcd_val`.**
