The code adds the `next_state` to the `visited` set. This means that the tuple `next_state` (which is (`next_platform`, `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`)) is now stored in the `visited` set. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 0 or 1, the new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, `queue` remains unchanged, `next_state` is (`next_platform`, `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`), `visited` contains the tuple `next_state`**
