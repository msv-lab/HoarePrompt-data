Postcondition: ***`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `levels[next_platform]` is updated to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is added to `visited`, and `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element, provided that `next_state` is not in `visited`. Otherwise, the conditions related to `levels[current_platform]`, `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform`, `steps`, `graph`, `next_state`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
