According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `next_platform` from the `graph[current_platform]`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one valid `next_platform` in the `graph[current_platform]`.

At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions were met:
- The queue does not contain its leftmost element.
- `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.
- `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.
- The next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level.
- If `next_state` is in `visited`, the function proceeds as if `next_state` is already visited; otherwise, `steps` is updated accordingly.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one valid `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`. Since the previous condition specified that `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, this condition is already satisfied.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `queue` still does not contain its leftmost element.
- `next_state` remains as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.
- `current_platform` is replaced by the new `next_platform`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- The next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level.
- If `next_state` is in `visited`, the function proceeds as if `next_state` is already visited; otherwise, `steps` is updated accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and if `next_state` is in `visited`, the function proceeds as if `next_state` is already visited; otherwise, `steps` is updated accordingly**.
