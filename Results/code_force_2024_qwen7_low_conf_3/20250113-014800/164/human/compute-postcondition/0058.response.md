According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `next_platform` within the list `graph[current_platform]`. The loop will execute if there is at least one valid `next_platform` that meets the condition.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were updated:
- `levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\)
- `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\)
- `current_platform` is set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`
- `steps` is incremented by 1
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `next_state` is either \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\)
- `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element, provided that `next_state` is not in `visited`

If `next_state` is already in `visited`, the postcondition remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one valid `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]` such that the `next_state` is not in `visited`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `current_platform` needs to be set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`
- `steps` needs to be incremented by 1
- `queue` should contain the new `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element, provided that the new `next_state` is not in `visited`

State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is either \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\), and `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element, provided that `next_state` is not in `visited`.**
