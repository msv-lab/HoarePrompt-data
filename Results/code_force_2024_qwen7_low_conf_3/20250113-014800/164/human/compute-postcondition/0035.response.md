The code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` will include this new tuple. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 1 or 2, the new level of the player is \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, `queue` includes the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `next_state` is \((next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H)\), and `visited` now contains the tuple `next_state`.**
