`next_state` is added to the set `visited`. The value of `next_state` is \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is now \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\), and `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element; `next_state` is added to the set `visited`.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is now \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\), and `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element; `next_state` is added to the set `visited`.**
