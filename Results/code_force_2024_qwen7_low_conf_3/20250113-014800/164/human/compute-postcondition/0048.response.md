`next_state` is added to the set `visited`. The value of `levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, and the value of `levels[next_platform]` is updated to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. The `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged, and `next_state` is not in `visited` anymore because it has been added.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `levels[next_platform]` is updated to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of the queue after `.popleft()`, `steps` remains unchanged, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is added to `visited`**
