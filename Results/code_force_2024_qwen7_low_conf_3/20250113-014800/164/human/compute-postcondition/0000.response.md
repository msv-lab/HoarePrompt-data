The provided code snippet does not actually perform any operations or calculations to determine the minimum number of steps needed to reach from platform 1 to platform `num_platforms`. Instead, it merely comments on what the intended calculation would be. Therefore, the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`num_platforms` is a positive integer such that 2 <= num_platforms <= 10^5; `num_passages` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_passages <= 10^5; `max_level` is a positive integer such that 1 <= max_level <= 10^9; `levels` is a list of `num_platforms` integers where each element is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive; `changes` is a list of `num_platforms` integers where each element is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive; `passages` is a list of `num_passages` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indices of the platforms connected by a passage (indices are 1-based). The code comments on calculating the minimum number of steps to reach from platform 1 to platform `num_platforms`, but does not execute this calculation.**
