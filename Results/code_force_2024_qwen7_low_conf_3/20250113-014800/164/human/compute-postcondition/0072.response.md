`next_state` is assigned the value of a tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Here, `next_platform` is derived from the `current_platform` (the leftmost element's value), and the second value in the tuple is the adjusted level of the next platform calculated using the modulo operation.

The initial state is as follows:
- `queue` does not contain its leftmost element.
- `current_platform` is the leftmost element's value.
- `steps` is the leftmost element's second value.
- `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.
- The next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level.

After executing the code, the `current_platform` value is no longer needed, as it is replaced by `next_platform`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `next_state`.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is the leftmost element's second value, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level.**
