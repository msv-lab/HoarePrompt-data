The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: a positive integer
- `m`: a non-negative integer
- `H`: a positive integer
- `levels`: a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive
- `changes`: a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive
- `passages`: a list of `m` tuples, each containing two distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive representing the platforms connected by a passage.

The function returns one of the following values:
- Case_1: The function returns `0`
- Case_2: The function returns a variable `steps` which remains unchanged
- Case_3: The function returns a variable `steps` which is the second value of the leftmost element in queue
- Case_4: The function returns `-1`

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `H`, `levels`, `changes`, and `passages`, and based on certain conditions, return either `0`, a variable `steps` (unchanged or from the queue), or `-1`.
