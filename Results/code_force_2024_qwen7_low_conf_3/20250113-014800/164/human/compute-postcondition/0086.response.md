The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the `visited` set. The `next_state` is defined as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. 

Given the initial state:
- `queue` does not contain its leftmost element.
- `current_platform` is the next platform.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- The next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level.
- `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.
- If `next_state` is in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, otherwise `queue` remains unchanged.

After executing `visited.add(next_state)`, the `next_state` is added to the `visited` set, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `current_platform` is the next platform, `steps` is incremented by 1, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, and `next_state` is added to the `visited` set.**
