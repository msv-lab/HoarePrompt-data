To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over each `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`. For each iteration, the following conditions are checked and actions are taken:

1. **Condition Check**: The current platform's level (`levels[current_platform]`) is compared with the next platform's level (`levels[next_platform]`). If they are equal, the player can move to the next platform.
2. **State Calculation**: If the player moves to the next platform, the new level is calculated as `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.
3. **Visited Check**: The `next_state` (which is the tuple `(next_platform, new level)`) is checked against the `visited` set.
4. **Queue Update**: If `next_state` is not in `visited`, it is added to both the `visited` set and the `queue`.

### Understanding the Output States
From the provided output states, we can infer the following:

- **After 1 iteration**: `current_platform` remains the same, `steps` is either 0 or 1, and the queue may include a new tuple `(current_platform, steps + 1)`.
- **After 2 iterations**: `current_platform` remains the same, `steps` can be 0, 1, or 2, and the queue may include new tuples based on the conditions met.
- **After 3 iterations**: Similar to the previous, `current_platform` remains the same, `steps` can be 1 or 2, and the queue may include new tuples.

### Final Output State
Since the loop continues to execute until there are no more valid moves (i.e., no unvisited next platforms), the final state will be:

- **Current Platform**: The `current_platform` will be the last platform the player reached.
- **Steps**: The `steps` will be the total number of moves made to reach the final platform.
- **New Level**: The new level of the player will be `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
- **Graph and Queue**: The `graph` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The `queue` will be empty since all valid moves have been processed.

### Output State
Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

**Output State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is a non-negative integer representing the total number of moves made, the new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `graph` remains unchanged, and `queue` is an empty deque.
