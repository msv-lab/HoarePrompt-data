The code initializes a queue using `deque` with a single tuple `(0, 0)`. This tuple consists of two elements: the first element represents the current level, which is set to `0`, and the second element represents the current node, also set to `0`.

The variables `t`, `H`, `m`, `levels`, `changes`, `passages`, and `graph` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `levels` is a list of `n` integers, `changes` is a list of `n` integers, `passages` is a list of `m` tuples, `graph` is a list of `n` lists, queue is a deque containing the tuple (0, 0)**.
