Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 0, 1, or 2, the new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, and `queue` remains unchanged or includes the tuple `next_platform` and `steps + 1` if `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is (`next_platform`, `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`), and `visited` either remains unchanged or contains the tuple `next_state`.***
