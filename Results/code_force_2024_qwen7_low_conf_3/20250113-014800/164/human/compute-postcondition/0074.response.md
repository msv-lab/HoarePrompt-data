The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the set `visited`. The value of `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Since `visited.add` method modifies the `visited` set by adding an element, the updated state is that `next_state` is added to `visited`.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is the leftmost element's second value, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and `next_state` is in `visited`**
