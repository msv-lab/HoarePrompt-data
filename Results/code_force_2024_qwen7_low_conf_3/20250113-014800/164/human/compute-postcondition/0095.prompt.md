You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and H are positive integers, m is a non-negative integer, levels is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and H-1 inclusive, changes is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and H-1 inclusive, and passages is a list of m tuples, each containing two distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive representing the platforms connected by a passage.
def func_1(n, m, H, levels, changes, passages):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (u, v) in passages:
        graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)
        
        graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `levels` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive, `changes` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive, `passages` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing two distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `graph` is a list of `n` lists where for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `graph[i]` contains all the nodes that are directly connected to node `i+1` via passages.
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    visited = set([(0, levels[0])])
    while queue:
        current_platform, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        if current_platform == n - 1:
            return steps
        
        for next_platform in graph[current_platform]:
            if levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]:
                next_state = next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[
                    next_platform]) % H
                if next_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_state)
                    queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))
        
        levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[
            current_platform]) % H
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `current_platform` is the final platform reached (n - 1), `steps` is the minimum number of steps taken to reach the final platform, `visited` contains all unique platforms visited during the traversal, `levels` is the list of levels of each platform updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, and `changes` is the list of changes in levels for each platform.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
#- `n`: a positive integer
#- `m`: a non-negative integer
#- `H`: a positive integer
#- `levels`: a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive
#- `changes`: a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `H-1` inclusive
#- `passages`: a list of `m` tuples, each containing two distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive representing the platforms connected by a passage.
#
#The function returns one of the following values:
#- Case_1: The function returns `0`
#- Case_2: The function returns a variable `steps` which remains unchanged
#- Case_3: The function returns a variable `steps` which is the second value of the leftmost element in queue
#- Case_4: The function returns `-1`
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `H`, `levels`, `changes`, and `passages`, and based on certain conditions, return either `0`, a variable `steps` (unchanged or from the queue), or `-1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: `The program returns steps which remains unchanged`

Case_3: The program returns steps which is the second value of the leftmost element in queue

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
