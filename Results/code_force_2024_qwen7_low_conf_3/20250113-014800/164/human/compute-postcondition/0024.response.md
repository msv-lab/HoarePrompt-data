Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is now `next_platform`; the new level of the player is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`; `steps` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `next_state` was in `visited`; `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element; `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`; if `next_state` was in `visited`, `queue` contains a new element `(next_platform, 1)`.***
