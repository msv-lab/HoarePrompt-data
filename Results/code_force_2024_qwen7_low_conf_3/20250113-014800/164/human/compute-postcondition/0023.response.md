The code `queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))` appends a tuple containing `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `next_platform` remains unchanged.
2. `steps` is updated to `steps + 1`.
3. A tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` is added to the `queue`.

Given the initial state:
- `current_platform` is now `next_platform`
- The new level of the player is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`
- `steps` is 0
- `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element
- `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`
- `next_state` is in `visited`

After executing the code, the following updates occur:
- `steps` is now `0 + 1 = 1`
- The queue `queue` now contains a new element `(next_platform, 1)`

Output State: **`current_platform` is now `next_platform`; the new level of the player is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`; `steps` is 1; `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element; `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]; `next_state` is in `visited`; `queue` contains a new element `(next_platform, 1)`**
