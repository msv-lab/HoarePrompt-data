To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and constraints for the given for loop:

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop iterates over each element in the `graph[current_platform]` list. This means the loop will only execute if `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element.

### Initial States Provided
- `t` is a positive integer
- `H` is a positive integer
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `levels` is a list of `n` integers
- `changes` is a list of `n` integers
- `passages` is a list of `m` tuples
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists
- `queue` is a deque without the tuple (0, 0)
- `visited` is a set containing the tuple (0, levels[0])
- `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`
- `steps` is 0

### Determining Necessary Adjustments
1. **`current_platform`**: It must be within the valid range for indexing into `graph`. The condition that `current_platform` is less than `n - 1` is already sufficient for accessing `graph[current_platform]`.

2. **`graph[current_platform]`**: This list should contain at least one element for the loop to execute. If it is empty, the loop will not run.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `graph[current_platform]` is not empty. 

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `H` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `levels` is a list of `n` integers, `changes` is a list of `n` integers, `passages` is a list of `m` tuples, `graph` is a list of `n` lists, `queue` is a deque without the tuple (0, 0), `visited` is a set containing the tuple (0, levels[0]), `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`, `steps` is 0, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element**
