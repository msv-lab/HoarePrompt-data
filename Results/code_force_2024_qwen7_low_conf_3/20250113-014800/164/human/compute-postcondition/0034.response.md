The line `visited.add(next_state)` adds the tuple `next_state` to the set `visited`. This means that `next_state` is now an element of `visited`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 1 or 2, the new level of the player is \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, `queue` remains unchanged or includes the tuple `next_platform` and `steps + 1` if `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is \((next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H)\), and `visited` now contains the tuple `next_state`.**
