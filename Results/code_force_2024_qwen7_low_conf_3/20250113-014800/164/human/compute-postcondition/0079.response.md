The code updates the value of `next_state`. According to the initial state, `next_state` was `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. The code reassigns `next_state` to this exact same expression, meaning the value of `next_state` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and if `next_state` is in `visited`, the function proceeds as if `next_state` is already visited; otherwise, `steps` is updated accordingly**
