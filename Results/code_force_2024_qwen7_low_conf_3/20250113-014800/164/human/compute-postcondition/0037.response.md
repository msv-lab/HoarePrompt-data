Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 1 or 2, the new level of the player is \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, and `queue` includes the tuple \((next_platform, steps + 1)\) if `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is \((next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H)\), and `visited` contains the tuple `next_state`.***

Explanation:
- Since the `else` part is not provided and there is no alternative action when the condition `levels[current_platform] != levels[next_platform]` is true, the state of the program remains unchanged from the precondition. 
- Therefore, the postcondition simply restates the conditions present in the precondition, as no additional actions are taken when the `else` part is not defined.
