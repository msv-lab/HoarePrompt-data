`queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the queue. This means that the `queue` will lose its first element, and `current_platform` and `steps` will be assigned the values of this element. The initial state is that `queue` is not empty.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `current_platform` is the leftmost element's value, `steps` is the leftmost element's second value**
