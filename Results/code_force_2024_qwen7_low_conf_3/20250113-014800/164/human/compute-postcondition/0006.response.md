The code assigns the value of `x1` to `y`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `y` is now `x1`, and the values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `H` is an integer such that \(1 \leq H \leq 10^9\), `l_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq l_i \leq H-1\), `s_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s_i \leq H-1\), `a` is not 0, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `b % a` and `a`, `x` is `y1 - b // a * x1`, `y` is `x1`**.
