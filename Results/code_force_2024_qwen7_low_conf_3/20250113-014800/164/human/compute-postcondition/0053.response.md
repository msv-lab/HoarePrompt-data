Next, the code snippet updates `next_state` by calculating `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. This means:

- `next_state` is set to a tuple containing `next_platform` and the updated value of `levels[next_platform]` which is \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\).
- The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph` remains unchanged, `next_state` is now \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\), and `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)` as the last element.**
