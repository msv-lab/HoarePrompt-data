The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the `visited` set. This means that `next_state` will now be considered as visited.

- The `queue` does not contain its leftmost element.
- `next_state` remains `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.
- `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- The next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level.
- If `next_state` was not already in `visited`, it has been added now.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and `next_state` is in `visited`.**
