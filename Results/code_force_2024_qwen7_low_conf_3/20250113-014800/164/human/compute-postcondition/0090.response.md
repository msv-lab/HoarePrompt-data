Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `current_platform` is the final platform reached, `steps` is the number of steps taken to reach that platform, `visited` contains all unique platforms visited, `graph` is the adjacency list of the platforms, `levels` is the list of levels of each platform, and `changes` is the list of changes in levels for each platform.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues to find valid next platforms that have the same level as the current platform, incrementing the `steps` and updating the `queue` until no more valid next platforms are found.
- The loop terminates when there are no more elements in `graph[current_platform]` or when `current_platform` equals `n - 1`, at which point the function returns `steps`.
- Throughout the iterations, the `visited` set ensures that each platform is only considered once.
- Once the loop completes, `current_platform` will be the final platform reached (or `n - 1` if the function returns early), and `steps` will be the total number of steps taken to reach this platform.
- The `queue` will no longer be used after the loop, as it was modified during each iteration to find new platforms.
