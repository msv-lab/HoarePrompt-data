Postcondition: **`levels[current_platform]` is updated to \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `levels[next_platform]` is updated to \((levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H\), `current_platform` is set to the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `next_state` is either \(`next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H`\), and if `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is added to `visited` and `(next_platform, steps + 1)` is added to `queue`.**
