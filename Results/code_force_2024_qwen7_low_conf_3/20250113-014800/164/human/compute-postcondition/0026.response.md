To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and consider the possible changes for each variable:

1. **`current_platform`**: This is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`.
2. **`steps`**: This is either 0 or 1.
3. **`new level`**: This is calculated as `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
4. **`graph[current_platform]`**: This contains at least one element.
5. **`queue`**: This contains a new element `(current_platform, steps + 1)` if `current_platform` is equal to `next_platform` and `next_platform` was in `visited`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

The loop iterates over `next_platform` for each element in `graph[current_platform]`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that there is at least one element left in `graph[current_platform]`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we assume that the only change is due to the iteration itself. The `next_platform` variable will be set to the next element in `graph[current_platform]` during the loop execution.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element.
- After iterating through one element (let’s say `next_platform`), the number of elements in `graph[current_platform]` decreases by one, but it still contains at least one element because it had at least two elements initially.
- For the loop to execute again, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the fact that `graph[current_platform]` still contains at least one element.

**State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 0 or 1, the new level of the player is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
