The code appends a tuple containing the `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. Here's the breakdown:

- `queue` initially does not contain its leftmost element.
- `current_platform` remains the next platform.
- `steps` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `steps` is the original value of `steps` plus 1.
- The next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level.
- `next_state` is defined as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` and is added to the `visited` set.
- The tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` is appended to `queue`.

Given these points, the updated state of the variables after the code execution is:

- `queue` now contains the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.
- `current_platform` remains the same as the next platform.
- `steps` is now `steps + 1`.
- The next platform's level is unchanged and remains equal to the current platform's level.
- `next_state` is in the `visited` set.

Output State: **`queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `current_platform` is the next platform, `steps` is `steps + 1`, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and `next_state` is in the `visited` set.**
