According to the code, the loop iterates over each `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element in `graph[current_platform]` that is not yet visited.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`.
- `steps` is either 0, 1, or 2.
- The new level of the player is \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\).
- `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element.
- `queue` remains unchanged or includes the tuple `next_platform` and `steps + 1` if `next_state` is not in `visited`.
- `next_state` is \((next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H)\).
- `visited` either remains unchanged or contains the tuple `next_state`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[current_platform]` must still contain at least one element that has not been visited.

Since we know `graph[current_platform]` contained at least one element at the end of the previous iteration, it means there is at least one unvisited platform available for the next iteration. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current `next_platform` to be the first unvisited element in `graph[current_platform]`, and `steps` incremented by 1.

State: **`current_platform` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `steps` is either 1 or 2, the new level of the player is \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\), `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element, and `queue` remains unchanged or includes the tuple `next_platform` and `steps + 1` if `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is \((next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) \% H)\), and `visited` either remains unchanged or contains the tuple `next_state`.**
