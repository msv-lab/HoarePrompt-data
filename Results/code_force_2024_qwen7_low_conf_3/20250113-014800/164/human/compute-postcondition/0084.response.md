To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and follow the logic step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `queue` does not contain its leftmost element.
  - `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.
  - `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`.
  - `steps` is incremented by 1.
  - The next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level.
  - If `next_state` is in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.
  - Otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition
The loop iterates over `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are valid platforms in `graph[current_platform]` that can be iterated over.

2. **Current State Analysis:**
   - `queue` does not contain its leftmost element.
   - `next_state` is calculated based on `next_platform`.
   - `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`.
   - `steps` is incremented.
   - The next platform's level is updated.
   - If `next_state` is in `visited`, `queue` is updated with `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `graph[current_platform]` still has elements to iterate over.
   - Since `next_platform` is updated and `steps` is incremented, the condition `queue` does not contain its leftmost element might change depending on the value of `next_state` and whether it is added to `queue`.

### Conclusion

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `queue` should not contain its leftmost element after the update.
- `current_platform` should be set to the next platform.
- `steps` should be incremented by 1.
- The next platform's level should be updated.
- If `next_state` is in `visited`, `queue` should be updated with `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `current_platform` is the next platform, `steps` is incremented by 1, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and if `next_state` is in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple (next_platform, steps + 1). Otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged.**
