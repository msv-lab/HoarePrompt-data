According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `next_platform`. The loop will iterate over each platform connected to `current_platform` as long as there are such platforms.

Here's the breakdown of the necessary adjustments:

1. **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element**: This condition must remain unchanged because the loop is about to process the next platform, and the current platform should not yet be in the queue.
2. **`current_platform` is the leftmost element's value**: This state needs to be maintained as it is the starting point of the loop.
3. **`steps` is the leftmost element's second value**: This value needs to be preserved since it represents the number of steps taken to reach the current platform.
4. **The condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are adjacent platforms in `graph[current_platform]`. If `graph[current_platform]` is empty, the loop will not execute. However, we need to ensure that `current_platform` is not already the target (`n - 1`) because in that case, the function would return immediately without entering the loop.

Therefore, the necessary state to adjust for the loop to execute is that `graph[current_platform]` must not be an empty list (i.e., it must contain at least one element).

State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `current_platform` is the leftmost element's value, `steps` is the leftmost element's second value, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element**
