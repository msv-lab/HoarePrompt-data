Postcondition: ***`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `current_platform` is replaced by `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, the next platform's level is equal to the current platform's level, and if `next_state` is in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple (next_platform, steps + 1). Otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged.***
