The code updates the value of `x` to `y1 - b // a * x1`. Here, `y1` and `x1` are integers that satisfy the equation `x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a = gcd_val`, and `b // a` performs integer division of `b` by `a`.

Since the initial values of `b`, `a`, `y1`, and `x1` are not specified, we can express the new value of `x` in terms of these variables. The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `H` is an integer such that \(1 \leq H \leq 10^9\), `l_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq l_i \leq H-1\), `s_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s_i \leq H-1\), `a` is not 0, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `b % a` and `a`, `x` is `y1 - b // a * x1`.**
