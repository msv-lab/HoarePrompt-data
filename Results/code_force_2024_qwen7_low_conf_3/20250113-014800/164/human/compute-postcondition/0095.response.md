Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts the parameters `n`, `m`, `H`, `levels`, `changes`, and `passages`. It constructs a graph representation of the platforms and their connections. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum number of steps required to travel from the first platform (platform 0) to the last platform (platform `n-1`). During the BFS, it considers the current level of each platform and updates it based on the changes specified in the `changes` list. If a path from the first platform to the last platform is found, the function returns the number of steps taken. If no such path exists, the function returns `-1`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If the starting platform (`0`) is already the last platform (`n-1`), the function should return `0` immediately without performing the BFS.
- If there are no passages defined in the `passages` list, the function should check if the starting platform and the last platform have the same initial level. If they do, the function should return `0`; otherwise, it should return `-1`.
- The function assumes that all platforms are reachable from the starting platform. If there is a scenario where the last platform is not reachable, the function should handle this case appropriately by returning `-1`.
