#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, H is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9, l_i is an integer such that 0 ≤ l_i ≤ H-1, s_i is an integer such that 0 ≤ s_i ≤ H-1, and the passages are pairs of integers representing connected platforms.
def func_1(a, b):
    """Compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm."""
    if (a == 0) :
        return b, 0, 1
        #The program returns b with its original value, 0 for the second element, and 1 for the third element
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `H` is an integer such that \(1 \leq H \leq 10^9\), `l_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq l_i \leq H-1\), `s_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s_i \leq H-1\). The value of `a` is not 0
    gcd_val, x1, y1 = func_1(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd_val, x, y
    #`The program returns gcd_val which is the GCD of b % a and a, x which is y1 - b // a * x1, and y which is x1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` as input. It computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. If `a` is zero, it directly returns `b` as the GCD and the values `0` and `1` for the other two elements. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the GCD and the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, along with the coefficients `x` and `y`.

Potential edge case: When `a` is zero, the function correctly returns `b` as the GCD and the values `0` and `1` for the other two elements, as per the provided annotations and return postconditions.

Missing functionality: The annotations and return postconditions do not mention the recursive nature of the function. However, the code itself uses recursion to solve the problem, which is an important aspect of its functionality.
