Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `even` contains all even gaps that satisfy `gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0` in ascending order, `odd` must have at least one element, `ans` is incremented by `2 * y_initial` if `y` is less than `gap // 2`; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `2 * (gap // 2)` and `y` is decremented by `gap // 2` and becomes `0`.***
