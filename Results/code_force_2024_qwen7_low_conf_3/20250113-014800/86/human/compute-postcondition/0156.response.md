The code `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. The initial state tells us that `y` is less than `gap` divided by 2. However, the exact value of `y` and `gap` is not specified, so we keep those conditions. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value.

Output State: **`odd` must have at least one element, `y` is a value such that `y` < `gap` / 2, `ans` is its current value plus `2 * y`.**
