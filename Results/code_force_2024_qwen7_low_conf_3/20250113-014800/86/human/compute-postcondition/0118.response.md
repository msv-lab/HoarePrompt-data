Postcondition: ***`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is an empty list, `y` is `x`, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is a positive integer, `t` is undefined, `a` is `[1, 1, 2]`, `ans` is `x - 1`, `st` is a set of the modified elements of `a` which are `{1, 2}`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
