Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 1, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 9, `st` is {2, 3, 4}, `t1` is 4, `t2` is 1**

Explanation: 
- The value of `t2` is calculated using the formula `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given `i` is 1, `a[1]` is 3, and `n` is 5. So, `t2` is `(3 + 2) % 5 = 5 % 5 = 0 + 1 = 1` (since the `%` operator returns a non-negative remainder). Therefore, `t2` is updated to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
