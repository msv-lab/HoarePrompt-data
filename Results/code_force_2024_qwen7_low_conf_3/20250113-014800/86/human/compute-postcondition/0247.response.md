`odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. The value of `gap` is `a[3] - a[2] - 1`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of `a[3]` and `a[2]`, we will keep the expression as it is.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `next_elem`, and `a[3]`, `a[2]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[3]`, `gap` is `a[3] - a[2] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing `[a[3] - a[2] - 1]`**
