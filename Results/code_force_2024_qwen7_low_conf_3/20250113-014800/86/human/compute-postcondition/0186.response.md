`ans` is initially the sum of all elements in the `even` list plus `2 * 0` (which is `0`) plus the new value of `gap`. Since `y` is 1, the expression `2 * y` evaluates to `2`. The code `ans += 2 * y` adds `2` to the current value of `ans`. The value of `even`, `gap`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `2`.

Output State: **`even` is a non-empty list, `gap` is the second element in the `even` list, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0` plus the new value of `gap` plus `2`, and `y` is `1`**
