The initial state is as follows:
- `odd` is a non-empty list.
- `y` is an integer, and its current value is less than `gap / 2`.
- `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `2 * y`.

The code snippet sets `y` to `0`. This changes the value of `y` but does not affect the values of `odd` and `ans`.

Output State: **`odd` is a non-empty list; `y` is 0; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `2 * y`.**
