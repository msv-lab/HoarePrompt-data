`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. The initial value of `y` is `0`, and since `0` minus any integer value (including itself) will still be `0`, the value of `y` remains `0`. The value of `ans` is determined by its current value plus `gap`, but since `y` is only affected by `gap // 2`, and `y` was `0` initially, no change occurs to `ans`. Therefore, the output state is: `odd` must have at least one element; `y` is 0; `ans` is its current value plus `gap`.

Output State: **`odd` must have at least one element; `y` is 0; `ans` is its current value plus `gap`.**
