Postcondition: ***`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is a list with at least one element, `y` is negative, `ans` is increased by `gap`, and the state of other variables remains unchanged. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` becomes 0, `ans` is decreased by `2 * y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
