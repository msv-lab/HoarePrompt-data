The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Initially, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`. After sorting, `a` becomes `[2, 3, 4]` since it was already sorted. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 8, `st` is {2, 3, 4}, `a` is sorted**
