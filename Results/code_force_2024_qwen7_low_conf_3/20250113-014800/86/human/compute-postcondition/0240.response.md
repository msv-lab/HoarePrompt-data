`odd` is appended with the value of `gap`. The value of `gap` depends on the value of `x`:
- If `x` is 2, then `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2`.
- Otherwise, `gap` is `a[1] - 2`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `next_elem`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise, `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise, and `odd` contains the value of `gap`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise, `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise, and `odd` contains `gap`.**
