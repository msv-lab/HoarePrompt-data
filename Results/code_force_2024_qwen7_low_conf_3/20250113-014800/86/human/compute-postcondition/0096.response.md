Postcondition: ***`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is a list with at least one element, `y` is negative and has been decreased by `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `gap'`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0, `ans` is further increased by `gap - 2 * y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Otherwise, no changes occur to `y` and `ans`.***
