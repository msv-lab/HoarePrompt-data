`ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Since `y` is the updated value including the new `gap`, the new value of `ans` is its previous value plus `2 * y`. The precondition that `odd` must have at least one element remains unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` must have at least one element; `y` is its updated value (which includes the new `gap`); `ans` is its current value plus the new `2 * y`.**
