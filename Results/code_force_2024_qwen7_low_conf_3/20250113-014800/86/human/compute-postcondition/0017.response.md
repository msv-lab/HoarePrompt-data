The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state where `ans` is 9, the new value of `ans` will be 10. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 1, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 10, `st` is {2, 3, 4}, `t1` is 4, `t2` is 1**
