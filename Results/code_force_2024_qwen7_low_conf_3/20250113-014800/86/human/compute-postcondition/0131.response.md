`odd.append(gap)` appends the current value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Given that the current value of `gap` is greater than 1 and is an odd number, `odd` will now contain this value.

Output State: **`next_elem` is `1` if `i` is `0`, `2` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `-a[0]` if `i` is `0`, `1 - a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `odd` is a list containing one element which is the current value of `gap` (an odd number greater than 1)**
