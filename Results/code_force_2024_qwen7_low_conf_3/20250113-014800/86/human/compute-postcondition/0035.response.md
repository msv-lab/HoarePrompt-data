Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `odd` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 8, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `even` is `[gap]`, `next_elem` is 3, `gap` is greater than 0 and `gap` is even, given that `gap` is even and greater than 0.***

This postcondition reflects the state of the program variables after the if-else block executes, considering that the if condition `gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0` is met, leading to the specified updates in the `even` list and other variables.
