Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `even` is a non-empty list.
   - `gap` is the first element in the `even` list.
   - `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0` (which is `0`) plus the current value of `gap`.
   - `y` is 0.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `even` list using the variable `gap`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `gap` was the first element in the list.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `gap` needs to be the next element in the `even` list.
   - Since `y` is 0, it means we are currently processing the first element of the list (as `y` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 for each iteration).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `even` remains a non-empty list.
   - `gap` will now be the second element in the `even` list.
   - `ans` will be recalculated based on the new value of `gap`.
   - `y` will be incremented to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`even` is a non-empty list, `gap` is the second element in the `even` list, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0` plus the new value of `gap`, and `y` is 1**.
