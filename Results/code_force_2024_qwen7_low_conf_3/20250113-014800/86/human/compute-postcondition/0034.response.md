The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. Since `gap` is even and greater than 0, it is specifically appended to the list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `odd` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 8, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `even` is `[gap]`, `next_elem` is 3, `gap` is greater than 0 and `gap` is even**
