`ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. The value of `y` is less than `gap / 2`, but the exact value of `y` and `gap` is not specified. Therefore, the value of `ans` is updated by `2 * y`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`even` must contain at least one element, `y` is an integer and its current value is less than `gap` / 2, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`**
