`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 8, so the new value of `ans` is 9. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is not defined, `i` is 0, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 9, `st` is {2, 3, 4}, `t1` is 3, `t2` is 4.

Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 0, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 9, `st` is {2, 3, 4}, `t1` is 3, `t2` is 4.**
