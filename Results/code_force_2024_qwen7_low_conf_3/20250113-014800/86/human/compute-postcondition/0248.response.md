The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. Since `gap` is defined as `a[3] - a[2] - 1`, the value of `gap` remains unchanged after appending it to `even`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `next_elem`, and `gap`) retain their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[3]`, `gap` is `a[3] - a[2] - 1`, `even` contains `[a[3] - a[2] - 1]`**
