`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. The value of `ans` is calculated as the previous value of `ans` minus `2 * next_gap` plus `gap`, but the specific values of these variables are not provided. The value of `odd` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `y` is now the previous value of `y` minus `gap // 2`.

Output State: **`odd` is a non-empty list, `y` is the previous value of `y` minus `gap // 2`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` minus `2 * next_gap` plus `gap`**
