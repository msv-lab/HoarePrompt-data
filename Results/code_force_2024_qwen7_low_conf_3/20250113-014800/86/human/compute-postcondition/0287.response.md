`y` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `ans` was increased by `2 * y` which means `ans` was increased by `0` (since `2 * y = 2 * 0`). Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `even` and `gap` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`even` contains at least one element, `ans` is increased by `0`, `y` is 0, `gap` remains unchanged**
