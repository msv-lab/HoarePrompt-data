Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` remains either `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, or `a[1]` if `x` is not 1, and `gap` remains either `n - 1` if `x` is 1, or `a[1] - a[0] - 1` if `x` is not 1, the code snippet updates the value of `next_elem`.

The condition `if i == x - 1` checks whether `i` is equal to `x - 1`. Given that `i` is 1, this translates to checking if `1 == x - 1`. For this to be true, `x` must be 2. 

- If `x` is 2, then `next_elem` is updated to `a[0] + n`.
- If `x` is not 2, then `next_elem` is updated to `a[1]`.

Since the initial state specifies that `x` must still be greater than 0 and does not provide specific values for `a[0]`, `a[1]`, or `n`, we keep these in their general form.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `x`:

- If `x` is 2, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
- If `x` is not 2, then `next_elem` is `a[1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise, `gap` remains either `n - 1` if `x` is 1, or `a[1] - a[0] - 1` if `x` is not 1.**
