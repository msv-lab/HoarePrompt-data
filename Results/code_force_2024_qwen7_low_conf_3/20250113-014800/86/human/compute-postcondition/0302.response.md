The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, it processes input data that includes multiple test cases, each containing specific integers and arrays. The function iterates through a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The constraints for these inputs are as follows:
- `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers satisfying \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\), and \(0 \leq y \leq n - x\).
- The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

After processing all test cases, the function returns a result based on the inputs provided. Since the output is not specified in the given information, we cannot determine the exact return value.
