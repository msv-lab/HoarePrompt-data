Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `i` is 0
- `odd` is an empty list
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is 5
- `x` is 10
- `y` is 15
- `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`
- `ans` is 8
- `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`
- `even` is an empty list
- `next_elem` is 3

The code snippet is:
```python
gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The variable `i` is 0.
2. The variable `next_elem` is 3.
3. The variable `a[i]` (where `i` is 0) is `a[0]`, which is 2.

So, `gap` is calculated as follows:
\[ gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1 = 3 - 2 - 1 = 0 \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `odd` is an empty list; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is 5; `x` is 10; `y` is 15; `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`; `ans` is 8; `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`; `even` is an empty list; `next_elem` is 3; `gap` is 0**
