Postcondition: ***`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is a list with at least one element. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `2 * y` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged if the condition is not met.***
