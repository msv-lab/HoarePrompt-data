The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. The value of `gap` is either `n - 1` if `x` is 1, or `a[1] - a[0] - 1` if `x` is not 1. Since the initial state mentions that the current value of `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, the value of `gap` remains unchanged. Therefore, the list `odd` now contains this value.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, or `a[1]` if `x` is not 1, `gap` is either `n - 1` if `x` is 1, or `a[1] - a[0] - 1` if `x` is not 1, and the current value of `gap` is greater than 1 and odd; `odd` is a list containing the value of `gap`**
