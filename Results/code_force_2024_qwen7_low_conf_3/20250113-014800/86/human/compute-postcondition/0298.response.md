`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. Since `ans` was increased by `gap`, and `y` was 0 if the initial condition was false, the only change is in the value of `y`. The value of `even` and `ans` remains unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`even` contains at least one element, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`**
