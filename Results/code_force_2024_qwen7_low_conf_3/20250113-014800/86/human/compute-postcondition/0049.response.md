Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `odd` remains as a list containing either `[gap]` where `gap` is an odd number greater than 1 or an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 8, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `even` becomes `[0, 1]`, `next_elem` is 4, `gap` is 1. This occurs because the condition `gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0` evaluates to false, hence the else part does not execute and `even` is set to `[0, 1]` as specified in the if part postcondition.***
