The code updates the variable `next_elem` based on the condition. Since `i` is 0 and `x` is 10, the condition `i == x - 1` is `False`. Therefore, `next_elem` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`, which is `a[0 + 1]` or `a[1]`. Given that `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `a[1]` is 3. 

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `odd` is an empty list; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is 5; `x` is 10; `y` is 15; `a` is [2, 3, 4]; `ans` is 8; `st` is {2, 3, 4}; `even` is an empty list; `next_elem` is 3.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `odd` is an empty list; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is 5; `x` is 10; `y` is 15; `a` is [2, 3, 4]; `ans` is 8; `st` is {2, 3, 4}; `even` is an empty list; `next_elem` is 3.**
