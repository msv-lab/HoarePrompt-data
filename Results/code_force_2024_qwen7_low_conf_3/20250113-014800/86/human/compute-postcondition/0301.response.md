Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps that were greater than 1 and odd across all test cases, `even` is an empty list if no even gaps exist, otherwise it is a sorted list of all even gaps, `y` is 0 if the loop breaks early during any test case, otherwise it is the initial value of `y` minus the sum of `gap // 2` for each element in `odd` across all test cases, `ans` is the final value computed for each test case adjusted according to the loop operations.**
