State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t must be greater than 0**.

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is specified to be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For the for loop `for _ in range(t):` to execute, `t` must be a positive integer greater than 0 because the `range(t)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) `t`. Therefore, if `t` is 0 or negative, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.
- Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)), the key requirement for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the initial state needs to ensure that `t` is greater than 0, which is already covered by the given range. Therefore, the state remains as provided but explicitly emphasizing that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
