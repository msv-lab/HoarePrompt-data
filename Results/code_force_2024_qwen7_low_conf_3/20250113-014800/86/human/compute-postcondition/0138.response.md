The code updates the value of `next_elem`. The new value of `next_elem` depends on the value of `i`:

- If `i` is `0`, then `next_elem` becomes `a[0] + n`.
- If `i` is `1`, then `next_elem` becomes `a[1]`.
- If `i` is `2`, then `next_elem` remains undefined.

The initial state provides that:
- `next_elem` is `1` if `i` is `0`, `2` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.
- `gap` is `-a[0]` if `i` is `0`, `1 - a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.

Let's consider each case for `i`:

1. **If `i` is `0`:**
   - Initial value of `next_elem` is `1`.
   - The code changes `next_elem` to `a[0] + n`.
   - So, `next_elem` becomes `a[0] + n`.
   - `gap` remains `-a[0]`.

2. **If `i` is `1`:**
   - Initial value of `next_elem` is `2`.
   - The code changes `next_elem` to `a[1]`.
   - So, `next_elem` becomes `a[1]`.
   - `gap` remains `1 - a[1]`.

3. **If `i` is `2`:**
   - Initial value of `next_elem` is undefined.
   - The code does not change `next_elem` because the condition `if i == x - 1` is not met (assuming `x` is `2`).
   - So, `next_elem` remains undefined.
   - `gap` remains undefined.

Since the initial state does not specify a specific value for `i`, we consider all three cases. However, since the initial state defines `next_elem` and `gap` explicitly for `i` being `0` and `1`, and they are undefined for `i` being `2`, the most precise output considering the given conditions is:

Output State: **`next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `0`, `a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `-a[0]` if `i` is `0`, `1 - a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.**
