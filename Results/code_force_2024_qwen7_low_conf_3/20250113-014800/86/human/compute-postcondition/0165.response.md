The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or conditional statement. Since there are no loops or conditions in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` must have at least one element; `y` is 0; `ans` is its current value plus the new `2 * y`.**
