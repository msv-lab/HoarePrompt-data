Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `odd` is a list containing either `[gap]` where `gap` is an odd number greater than 1 or an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 8, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `even` is a list containing `[0]` or `[gap]` where `gap` is even and greater than 0, `next_elem` is 4, `gap` is 0.***

This postcondition accounts for both the if and else parts of the block, ensuring that the variables maintain their specified states under the given conditions.
