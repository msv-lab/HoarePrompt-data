To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the loop variable (`gap`), the condition under which the loop runs, and any other relevant variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Variable (`gap`)**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements in the `even` list.
   - The state before the loop starts should include the `even` list, since `gap` takes values from this list during each iteration.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs as long as there are elements in the `even` list.
   - If `even` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Other Relevant Variables**:
   - `odd`: This list is mentioned in the problem but not used in the loop. It's already defined and sorted.
   - `y`: The value of `y` depends on whether the loop breaks early or not. If the loop does not break early, `y` is calculated as described.
   - `ans`: This is the sum of all elements in `odd` if the loop does not break early, otherwise, it is the sum up to the point where the loop breaks.

### Required States for Loop Execution:

- The `even` list must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `gap` will start as the first element in the `even` list during the first iteration.
- Since `y` and `ans` are derived from the loop execution, they are not directly adjusted here, but their final values depend on the loop execution.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`even` is a non-empty list, `gap` is the first element in the `even` list, `y` is 0 if the loop breaks early, otherwise it is the initial value of `y` minus the sum of `gap // 2` for each element in `even`, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` if the loop does not break early, otherwise it is the sum of all elements in `even` up to the point where the loop breaks.**
