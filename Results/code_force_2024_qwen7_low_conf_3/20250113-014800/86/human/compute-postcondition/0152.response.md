The code `odd.sort()` sorts the list `odd`. The sorting operation does not affect the other variables (`even`, `next_elem`, and `gap`). After sorting, the elements in the `odd` list will be arranged in ascending order.

Output State: **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a list of all gaps that were greater than 0 and even, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, and `gap` is `(a[0] + n) - a[i] - 1` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1.`**
