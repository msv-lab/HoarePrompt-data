The given code snippet does not provide the full context of the variables `a`, `i`, and `n`. However, based on the snippet:

```python
t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
```

we can infer that:
- `t2` is assigned the value of `(a[i] + 2) % n`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `i`, and `n`, we can only state that `t2` is calculated using the expression `(a[i] + 2) % n`. The values of `a`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `a` is its original value, `i` is its original value, `n` is its original value.**
