According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `even`. The loop will continue as long as `even` has at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `odd` is a non-empty list.
- `even` is a list with at least one element.
- `y` is negative and has been decreased by `gap // 2`.
- `ans` is increased by `gap`.
- The most internal loop or if statement is not broken out.

For the loop to execute one more time, `even` must still have at least one element. Since `even` had at least one element at the end of the last iteration, it means it still has at least one element now.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `even` must still have at least one element.

State: **`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is a list with at least one element, `y` is negative and has been decreased by `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `gap', and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken out.**
