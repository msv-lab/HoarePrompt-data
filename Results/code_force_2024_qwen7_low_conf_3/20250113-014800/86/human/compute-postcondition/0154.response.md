According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `gap`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `odd`. For the loop to execute, the list `odd` must contain at least one element. 

Let's break down the initial state and what needs to be adjusted:

1. **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps that were greater than 1 and odd**: This means `odd` is already defined as a list, but we need to ensure it contains at least one element.
2. **`even` is a sorted list of all gaps that were greater than 0 and even**: This list is not relevant to the current loop.
3. **`next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`: This is a variable that may change during the loop, but it doesn't affect the loop's initiation.
4. **`gap` is `(a[0] + n) - a[i] - 1` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1`: Similar to `next_elem`, this is a variable that changes within the loop and doesn't affect the loop's initiation.

To ensure the loop can execute, the list `odd` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`odd` must have at least one element**
