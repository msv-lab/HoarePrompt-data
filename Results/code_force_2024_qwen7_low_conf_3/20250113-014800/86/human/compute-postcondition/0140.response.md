The code `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Based on the initial state, the value of `gap` depends on the value of `i`:

- If `i` is `0`, `gap` is `n - 1`.
- If `i` is `1`, `gap` is `-1`.
- If `i` is `2`, `gap` is undefined.

Since appending an element to a list does not affect other variables and the value of `gap` changes based on the value of `i`, we need to consider the three possible cases for `i`.

Output State: **`next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `0`, `a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `n - 1` if `i` is `0`, `-1` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `odd` is a list with one element, which is either `n - 1` if `i` is `0`, `-1` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.**
