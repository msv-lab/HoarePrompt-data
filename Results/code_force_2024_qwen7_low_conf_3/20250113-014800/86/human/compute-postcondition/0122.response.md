`ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `t2`, `a`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `a` is its original value, `i` is its original value, `n` is its original value, `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `a` is its original value, `i` is its original value, `n` is its original value, `ans` is increased by 1**
