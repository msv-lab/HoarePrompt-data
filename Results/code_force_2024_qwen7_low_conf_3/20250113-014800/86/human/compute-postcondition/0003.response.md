The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Let's assume the user inputs values for `n`, `x`, and `y`, and then additional values separated by spaces for `a`.

For example, if the user inputs:
- `n = 5`
- `x = 10`
- `y = 15`
- followed by the line `3 4 5`

Then `a` would be `[3, 4, 5]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is [3, 4, 5]**
