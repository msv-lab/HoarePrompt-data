Postcondition: ***`next_elem` is `1` if `i` is `0`, `2` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `-a[0]` if `i` is `0`, `1 - a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`. If `gap` is an odd number greater than 1, `odd` contains `[gap]`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains `[gap]`. Otherwise, `next_elem` and `gap` remain unchanged.***
