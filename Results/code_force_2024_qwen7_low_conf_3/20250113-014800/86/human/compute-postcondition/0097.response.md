The code `ans += gap` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `gap`. There is no change to `odd`, `even`, `y`, or any other variable that was not mentioned in the update.

Since the condition `if y < gap // 2` is not specified to be checked again after this line, we assume it does not change the state of `y` or `ans`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is updated to be its previous value plus `gap`.

Output State: **`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is a list with at least one element, `y` is negative and has been decreased by `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `gap`.**
