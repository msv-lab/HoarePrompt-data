The code snippet `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Before the execution, `gap` is greater than 1 and is an odd number. After appending `gap` to `odd`, the list `odd` will contain the value of `gap`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `odd` is an empty list plus `[gap]` where `gap` is an odd number greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 8, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is 3, `gap` is greater than 1 and is an odd number**
