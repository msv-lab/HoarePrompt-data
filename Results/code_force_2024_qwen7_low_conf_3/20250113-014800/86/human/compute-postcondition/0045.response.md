Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `odd` is a list containing either `[gap]` where `gap` is an odd number greater than 1 or an empty list
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is 5
   - `x` is 10
   - `y` is 15
   - `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`
   - `ans` is 8
   - `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`
   - `even` is a list containing `[0]` or `[gap]` where `gap` is even and greater than 0
   - `next_elem` is 4
   - `gap` is 0

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Check the condition `i == x - 1`:
     - `i` is 1
     - `x` is 10
     - So, `i == x - 1` evaluates to `1 == 9`, which is `False`.
   - Since the condition is `False`, the expression `a[i + 1]` is used.
   - Calculate `i + 1`:
     - `i + 1` is `1 + 1`, which is `2`.
   - Retrieve the element at index `2` from list `a`:
     - `a[2]` is `4`.

4. **Update `next_elem`:**
   - `next_elem` is updated to `4`.

5. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `next_elem` is updated to `4`.

**Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is a list containing either `[gap]` where `gap` is an odd number greater than 1 or an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 8, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `even` is a list containing `[0]` or `[gap]` where `gap` is even and greater than 0, `next_elem` is 4, `gap` is 0.**
