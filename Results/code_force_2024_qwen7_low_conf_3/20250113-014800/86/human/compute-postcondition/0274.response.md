The code `ans += gap` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `gap`. The previous value of `ans` was incremented by `2 * y_initial` if `y` was less than `gap // 2`, or by `2 * (gap // 2)` and then `y` was decremented by `gap // 2` and became `0`. Since the value of `gap` is being added to `ans`, the updated value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus the current value of `gap`.

Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `even` contains all even gaps that satisfy `gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0` in ascending order, `odd` must have at least one element, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `gap`.**
