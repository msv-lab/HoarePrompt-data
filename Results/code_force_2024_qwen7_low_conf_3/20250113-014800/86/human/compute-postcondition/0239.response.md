`next_elem` is defined based on the value of `x`. Since `x` must still be greater than 0, we consider two cases for `x`:

1. If `x` is 2, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
2. Otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[1]`.

The code `gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1` updates the value of `gap`. We need to evaluate `next_elem` based on the value of `x` and then subtract `a[i]` (which is 1) and 1 from it.

- If `x` is 2, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, and `gap` becomes `(a[0] + n) - 1 - 1 = a[0] + n - 2`.
- If `x` is not 2, then `next_elem` is `a[1]`, and `gap` becomes `a[1] - 1 - 1 = a[1] - 2`.

Since `x` must still be greater than 0, the possible values for `x` are greater than 0, excluding 2. So, `x` could be 1 or any number greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` remains 1.
- `x` must still be greater than 0.
- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise.
- `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise, `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise.**
