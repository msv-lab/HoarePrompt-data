Postcondition: **`even` is a non-empty list, `gap` is the first element in the `even` list, `y` is the initial value of `y` minus the sum of `gap // 2` for each element in `even`, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` up to the point where the loop breaks, and `y` is currently less than `gap // 2`**
