`ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is 10, so after the increment, `ans` becomes 11. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is not defined, `i` is 2, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 11, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `t1` is 0, `t2` is 1.

Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 2, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 11, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `t1` is 0, `t2` is 1**
