`ans` is increased by `2 * y`. Since `y` is less than 0 or not specified in a specific numerical form, we will keep it as `y` in the expression. The value of `y` does not change, and the precondition that `even` contains at least one element and `gap` remains unchanged is still valid.

Output State: **`even` contains at least one element, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, `y` is less than 0, `gap` remains unchanged**
