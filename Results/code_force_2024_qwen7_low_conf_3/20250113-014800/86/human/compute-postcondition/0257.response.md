`y` is assigned the value `0`. This updates the value of `y` from its previous state, but does not affect the values of `i`, `even`, `odd`, or `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `even` contains all even gaps that satisfy `gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0` in ascending order, `odd` must contain at least one element, the current value of `y` is `0`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * y`**
