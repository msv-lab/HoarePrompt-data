The code `n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads three integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial value of `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged because no operation is performed on `t`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer read from input, `x` is an integer read from input, `y` is an integer read from input**
