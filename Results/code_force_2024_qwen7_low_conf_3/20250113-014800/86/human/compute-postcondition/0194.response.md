Output State: **`even` is a non-empty list, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0 + b` plus `2 * 0`, `y` is reduced by `b // 2`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `ans` was the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0 + b`, and `y` was reduced by `b // 2`.
- The code `y = 0` assigns the value 0 to `y`.
- Since `y` is now 0, the term `2 * y` in the expression for `ans` becomes `2 * 0`, which is 0.
- The value of `ans` is updated to include this new term, so it is now the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0 + b` plus `2 * 0`, which simplifies to the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * b`.
- The value of `y` is now 0, which is the result of reducing it by `b // 2`.
- The list `even` remains unchanged.
