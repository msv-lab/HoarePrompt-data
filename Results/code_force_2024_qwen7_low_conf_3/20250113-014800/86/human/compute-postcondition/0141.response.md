The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. Based on the initial state, the value of `gap` depends on the value of `i`.

- If `i` is `0`, then `gap` is `n - 1`.
- If `i` is `1`, then `gap` is `-1`.
- If `i` is `2`, then `gap` is undefined.

After appending `gap` to the list `even`, the following changes occur:

- The value of `next_elem` remains unchanged.
- The value of `gap` remains unchanged.
- The list `even` now contains the value of `gap`.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `0`, `a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.
- `gap` is `n - 1` if `i` is `0`, `-1` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.
- `even` is a list containing one element, which is `gap`.

Output State: **`next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `0`, `a[1]` if `i is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `n - 1` if `i` is `0`, `-1` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `even` is a list containing one element, which is `gap`.**
