The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or match-case. In this case, since the code snippet only contains a single `break` statement, it does not affect any variables or lists. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is a list with at least one element, `y` is 0, `ans` is decreased by `2 * y`, the state of other variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
