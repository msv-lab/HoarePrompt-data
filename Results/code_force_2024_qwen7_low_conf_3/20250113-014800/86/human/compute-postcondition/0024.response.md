To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the loop code and the output states provided for the first few iterations.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `x-1` (where `x = 10`). For each iteration, it calculates `t1` and `t2` using the formulae:
\[ t1 = (a[i] + 1) \% n \]
\[ t2 = (a[i] + 2) \% n \]

It then checks if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. If this condition is met, `ans` is incremented by 1.

### Initial Values
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is 5
- `x` is 10
- `y` is 15
- `a` is [2, 3, 4], which is sorted
- `ans` is 8
- `st` is {2, 3, 4}

### Iteration Analysis
Let's examine the first few iterations to identify any patterns:

#### Iteration 1 (`i = 0`)
- `t1 = (2 + 1) \% 5 = 3`
- `t2 = (2 + 2) \% 5 = 4`
- Since `3` is in `st` and `4` is in `st`, `ans` remains 8.

#### Iteration 2 (`i = 1`)
- `t1 = (3 + 1) \% 5 = 4`
- `t2 = (3 + 2) \% 5 = 0`
- Since `4` is in `st` and `0` is not in `st`, `ans` remains 8.

#### Iteration 3 (`i = 2`)
- `t1 = (4 + 1) \% 5 = 0`
- `t2 = (4 + 2) \% 5 = 1`
- Since `0` is not in `st` and `1` is not in `st`, `ans` remains 8.

### General Pattern
For each iteration:
- `t1` and `t2` are calculated based on the current value of `i`.
- The condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` is never met because all values of `t1` and `t2` generated are either in `st` or neither is in `st`.

Since the condition is never met, `ans` does not change from its initial value of 8.

### Final Output State
After all iterations of the loop, the values of the variables will be:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is 5
- `x` is 10
- `y` is 15
- `a` is [2, 3, 4], which is sorted
- `ans` is 8
- `st` is {2, 3, 4}
- `i` is 10 (since the loop runs from 0 to x-1)

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
**Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 8, `st` is {2, 3, 4}, `i` is 10.
