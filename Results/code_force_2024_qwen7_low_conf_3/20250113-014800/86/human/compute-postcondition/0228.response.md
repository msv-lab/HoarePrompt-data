The code assigns `a[0] + n` to `next_elem` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise it assigns `a[i + 1]` to `next_elem`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `x` must be greater than 0, let's analyze the conditions:

- Since `i` is 0, the condition `i == x - 1` simplifies to `0 == x - 1`, which means `x` must be 1 for the first part of the conditional to be true.
- If `x` is not 1 (which would violate the condition `x > 0` since `x` must be greater than 0), then `next_elem` will be assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`, which is `a[0 + 1]` or `a[1]`.

Therefore, the output state will depend on whether `x` is 1 or not:
- If `x` is 1, `next_elem` is assigned `a[0] + n`.
- If `x` is not 1, `next_elem` is assigned `a[1]`.

The output state is:
**`i` is 0; `x` must be greater than 0; `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, or `a[1]` if `x` is not 1.**
