Now, let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:** 
   - `i` is 2
   - `x` must still be greater than 0
   - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise
   - `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code assigns a new value to `next_elem` based on the condition `i == x - 1`.
   - Since `i` is 2, and `x` is greater than 0, let's consider both cases:
     - If `x` is 2: `i == x - 1` evaluates to `2 == 2 - 1` which is `False`.
     - If `x` is not 2, the condition `i == x - 1` would evaluate differently, but since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we will proceed with the given condition.

3. **Updating Variables:**
   - Since `i` is 2, the condition `i == x - 1` is `False`, so the assignment `next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]` simplifies to `next_elem = a[i + 1]`.
   - Given `i` is 2, `a[i + 1]` is `a[3]`.

4. **Output State:**
   - The value of `i` remains 2.
   - The value of `x` remains greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `next_elem` is now `a[3]`.
   - The value of `gap` remains unchanged, which depends on the value of `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[3]`, `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise.**
