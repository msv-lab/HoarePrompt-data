The code `ans += 2 * y` increments `ans` by twice the value of `y`. The initial state is that `even` is a non-empty list, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0 + b`, and `y` is reduced by `b // 2`. After executing the code, the value of `ans` is updated to include `2 * y`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`even` is a non-empty list, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0 + b` plus `2 * y`, `y` is reduced by `b // 2`**
