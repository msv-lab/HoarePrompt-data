`ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Given that `y` is defined as `odd.next - gap // 2`, the value of `ans` will be increased by `2 * (odd.next - gap // 2)`. The state of `odd` and `y` remains unchanged, and the value of `gap` is also not affected.

Output State: **`odd` must have at least two elements, `y` is the next element in `odd` minus `gap // 2`, `ans` is the next element in `odd` plus `gap`, and `ans` is increased by `2 * (odd.next - gap // 2)`**
