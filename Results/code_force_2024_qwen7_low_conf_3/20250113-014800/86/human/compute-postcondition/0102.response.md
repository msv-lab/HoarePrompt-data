The code `n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. This changes the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state of `odd` being a non-empty list and `even` being an empty list remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is also unchanged since no operation involving `ans` was performed. The variable `t` is not mentioned in the initial state and is not initialized in the given code snippet, so its state is undefined.

Output State: **`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is an empty list, `y` is `x`, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `t` is undefined**
