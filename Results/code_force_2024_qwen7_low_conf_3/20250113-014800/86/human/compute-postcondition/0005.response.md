`ans` is assigned the value of `x - 2`. Given that `x` is 10, the value of `ans` becomes 8. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 5, `x` is 10, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 8**
