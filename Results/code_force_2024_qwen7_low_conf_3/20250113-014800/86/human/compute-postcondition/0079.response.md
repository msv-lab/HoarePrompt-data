`ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. The value of `y` is less than `gap // 2`, but the exact value of `y` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is increased by twice the value of `y`.

Output State: **`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is a list with at least one element, `y` is a value less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`**
