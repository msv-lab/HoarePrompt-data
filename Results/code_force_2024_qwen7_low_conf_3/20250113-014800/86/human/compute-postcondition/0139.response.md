The initial state is defined as follows:
- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `0`, `a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.
- `gap` is `-a[0]` if `i` is `0`, `1 - a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```
gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code step-by-step:

1. The value of `gap` is being updated based on the value of `next_elem` and `a[i]`.
2. We need to consider three cases based on the value of `i`:
   - Case 1: If `i` is `0`, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` and `gap` is `-a[0]`. Substituting these values into the equation:
     \[
     gap = (a[0] + n) - a[0] - 1 = n - 1
     \]
   - Case 2: If `i` is `1`, then `next_elem` is `a[1]` and `gap` is `1 - a[1]`. Substituting these values into the equation:
     \[
     gap = a[1] - a[1] - 1 = -1
     \]
   - Case 3: If `i` is `2`, then both `next_elem` and `gap` are undefined. Since the value of `next_elem` and `gap` are undefined, the equation `gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1` does not provide a specific numerical value for `gap`.

Given these scenarios, the updated states of the variables are as follows:
- If `i` is `0`, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` and `gap` is `n - 1`.
- If `i` is `1`, then `next_elem` is `a[1]` and `gap` is `-1`.
- If `i` is `2`, then `next_elem` and `gap` remain undefined.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `0`, `a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `n - 1` if `i` is `0`, `-1` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.**
