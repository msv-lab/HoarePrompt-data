Postcondition: ***`next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `0`, `a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `n - 1` if `i` is `0`, `-1` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `even` is a list containing one element, which is `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
