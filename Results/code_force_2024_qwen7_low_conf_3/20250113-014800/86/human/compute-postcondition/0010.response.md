The code initializes `t2` with the value of `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`

The value of `a[i]` is `a[0]`, which is 2. Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[ t2 = (2 + 2) \% 5 = 4 \% 5 = 4 \]

So, `t2` is assigned the value 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 0, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 8, `st` is {2, 3, 4}, `t1` is 3, `t2` is 4**
