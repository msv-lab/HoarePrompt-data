According to the given for loop statement, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `i` is 1
- `x` must still be greater than 0
- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise
- `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise
- If `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `odd` contains `gap`. Otherwise, `even` contains one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even; otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `x`.

Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 2 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 2. The condition `x > 0` must still hold true.

The values of `next_elem` and `gap` do not change based on the value of `i` directly, but they depend on the value of `x`. Since `x` must still be greater than 0, its value does not change. The values of `odd` and `even` also do not change based on the increment of `i`, so they remain as they were.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise, `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise. If `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `odd` contains `gap`. Otherwise, `even` contains one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even; otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.**
