First, let's break down the initial state and the given code:

- Initial State: `odd` is a non-empty list, `y` is \(-(\text{next_gap} // 2) - (\text{next_gap} // 2)\), and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `next_gap`.
- Code: `ans += 2 * y`

From the initial state, we know:
- `y = -(\text{next_gap} // 2) - (\text{next_gap} // 2)`. Since `//` denotes integer division, this simplifies to `y = -2 * (\text{next_gap} // 2)`. If `next_gap` is even, `next_gap // 2` is half of `next_gap`, so `y` is `-next_gap`. If `next_gap` is odd, `next_gap // 2` is `(next_gap - 1) // 2`, so `y` is also `-next_gap`.

Given this, we can substitute `y` into the code:
- `ans += 2 * (-next_gap)`

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
- `ans += -2 * next_gap`

This means `ans` is updated by subtracting `2 * next_gap` from its current value.

Now, updating the variables:
- `odd` remains a non-empty list (no change).
- `y` is still defined as \(-(\text{next_gap} // 2) - (\text{next_gap} // 2)\), which is `-next_gap`.
- `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `-2 * next_gap`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`odd` is a non-empty list, `y` is `-next_gap`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` minus `2 * next_gap`**.
