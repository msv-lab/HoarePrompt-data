`next_elem` is either `1`, `2`, or undefined based on the value of `i`. The value of `a[i]` is not specified, but we know that `next_elem` is defined for `i` being `0` or `1`.

The code calculates `gap` as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Since `a[i]` is not specified, let's consider the possible values for `next_elem`:

- If `i` is `0`, then `next_elem` is `1`.
- If `i` is `1`, then `next_elem` is `2`.

In both cases, the value of `gap` will be:

- If `i` is `0`, then `gap` is `1 - a[0] - 1 = -a[0]`.
- If `i` is `1`, then `gap` is `2 - a[1] - 1 = 1 - a[1]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`next_elem` is `1` if `i` is `0`, `2` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `-a[0]` if `i` is `0`, `1 - a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`.**
