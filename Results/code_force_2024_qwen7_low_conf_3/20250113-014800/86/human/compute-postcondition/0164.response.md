`y` is assigned the value `0`. This changes the value of `y` but does not affect the values of `odd` or `ans`. The precondition that `odd` must have at least one element remains unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` must have at least one element; `y` is 0; `ans` is its current value plus the new `2 * y`.**
