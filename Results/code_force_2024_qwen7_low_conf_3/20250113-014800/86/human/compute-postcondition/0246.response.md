`gap` is assigned the value `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Given the initial state:
- `i` remains 2.
- `x` remains greater than 0.
- `next_elem` is `a[3]`.
- The value of `gap` remains unchanged, which depends on the value of `x`.

Since `next_elem` is `a[3]` and `i` is 2, we can substitute these values into the equation:
`gap = a[3] - a[2] - 1`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[3]`, `gap` is `a[3] - a[2] - 1`**
