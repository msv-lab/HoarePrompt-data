`t2` is assigned the value `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, and `n` is 5. Therefore, `a[i]` is `a[2]`, which is 4. So, `t2` is calculated as `(4 + 2) % 5`, which is `6 % 5`, resulting in `1`.

The output state is: `total` is not defined, `i` is 2, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `ans` is 10, `st` is `{2, 3, 4}`, `t1` is 0, `t2` is 1.
