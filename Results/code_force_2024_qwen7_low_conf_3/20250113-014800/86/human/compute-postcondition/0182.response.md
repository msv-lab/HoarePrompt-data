Postcondition: ***`even` is a non-empty list, `gap` is the first element in the `even` list. If `y < gap // 2`, then `ans` is the sum of all elements in `even` plus `2 * 0` up to the point where the loop breaks, and the loop was exited. Since there is no else part, the conditions outside the if statement remain unchanged.***
