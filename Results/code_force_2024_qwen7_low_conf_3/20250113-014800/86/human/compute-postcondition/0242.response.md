Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise, `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise; if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, `even` contains one element which is `gap`. Otherwise, the list `even` remains unchanged.***
