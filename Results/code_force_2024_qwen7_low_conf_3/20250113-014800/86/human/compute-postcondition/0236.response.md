Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, or `a[1]` if `x` is not 1, `gap` is either `n - 1` if `x` is 1, or `a[1] - a[0] - 1` if `x` is not 1. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or even, and the condition remains as initially defined.***
