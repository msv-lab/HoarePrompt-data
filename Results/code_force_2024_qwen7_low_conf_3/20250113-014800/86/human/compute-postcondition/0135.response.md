Postcondition: ***`next_elem` is `1` if `i` is `0`, `2` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; `gap` is `-a[0]` if `i` is `0`, `1 - a[1]` if `i` is `1`, and undefined if `i` is `2`; additionally, `even` contains `[gap]` where `gap` is greater than `0` and even. If the condition `gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0` is true, then `next_elem` and `gap` retain their original values and `even` is updated accordingly. If the condition is false, `next_elem` and `gap` remain unchanged.***
