Step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state is as follows:
   - `total` is not defined
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is 10
   - `n` is 5
   - `y` is 15
   - `a` is [2, 3, 4]
   - `ans` is 9
   - `st` is {2, 3, 4}
   - `t1` is 3
   - `t2` is 4

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
   ```

3. Evaluate the expression `(a[i] + 1) % n`:
   - `a[i]` where `i` is 1 means `a[1]`, which is 3.
   - So, `(a[i] + 1) % n` becomes `(3 + 1) % 5`, which is `4 % 5` and equals `4`.

4. The value of `t1` is updated to 4.

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 1, `x` is 10, `n` is 5, `y` is 15, `a` is [2, 3, 4], `ans` is 9, `st` is {2, 3, 4}, `t1` is 4, `t2` is 4**
