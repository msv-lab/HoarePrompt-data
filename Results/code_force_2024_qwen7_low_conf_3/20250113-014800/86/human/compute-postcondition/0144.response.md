Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: 
   - `next_elem`: Defined based on `i`:
     - If `i` is `0`, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
     - If `i` is `1`, then `next_elem` is `a[1]`.
     - Undefined if `i` is `2`.
   - `gap`: Defined based on `i`:
     - If `i` is `0`, then `gap` is `n - 1`.
     - If `i` is `1`, then `gap` is `-1`.
     - Undefined if `i` is `2`.
   - `odd`: Defined based on `i`:
     - If `i` is `0`, then `odd` is `[n - 1]`.
     - If `i` is `1`, then `odd` is `[-1]`.
     - Undefined if `i` is `2`.
   - `even`: If `gap > 1` and `gap % 2 == 1`, then `odd` is `[gap]`; otherwise, `even` is `[gap]` if `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` determines the state of `next_elem`, `gap`, and `odd`.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `1` (assuming `x` is at least `2`).
   - We need to update the state of `next_elem`, `gap`, and `odd` for `i = 1`.

4. **Updating the States**:
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `next_elem` will be `a[1]`.
     - `gap` will be `-1`.
     - `odd` will be `[-1]`.

5. **Final State**:
   - The updated state will be:
     - `next_elem` is `a[1]`.
     - `gap` is `-1`.
     - `odd` is `[-1]`.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` is `-1`, `odd` is `[-1]`**
