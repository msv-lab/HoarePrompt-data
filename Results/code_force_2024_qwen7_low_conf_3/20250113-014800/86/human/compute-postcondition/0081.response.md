The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but rather breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. In this case, since no loop or conditional statement was mentioned in the code, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` is a non-empty list, `even` is a list with at least one element, `y` is 0, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
