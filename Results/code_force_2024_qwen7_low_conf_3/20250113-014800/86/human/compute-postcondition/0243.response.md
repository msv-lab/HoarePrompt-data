Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `x` must still be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 2, or `a[1]` otherwise, `gap` is `a[0] + n - 2` if `x` is 2, or `a[1] - 2` otherwise. If `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `odd` contains `gap`. Otherwise, `even` contains one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even; otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.***
