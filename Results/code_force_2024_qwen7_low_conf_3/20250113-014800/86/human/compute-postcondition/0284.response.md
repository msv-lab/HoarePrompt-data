`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. Since `gap` is unchanged, `gap // 2` is also unchanged. Given that `y` was less than `gap // 2` or not, and now it is decremented by `gap // 2`, the new value of `y` will be less than 0 or not.

Output State: **`even` contains at least one element, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is less than 0 or not, `gap` remains unchanged.**
