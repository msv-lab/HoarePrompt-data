Postcondition: ***`even` is a non-empty list, `ans` is `x - 2`, `y` is the initial value of `y` minus the sum of `gap // 2` for each element in `odd` from the previous iteration, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, `t` is `previous_t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each element is `num - 1` for each `num` in the original list `a`, `st` is a set containing elements `{num - 1 | num in original a}`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`***
