The function processes `t` test cases, each containing integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing chosen vertices. For each test case, it computes a value `ans` based on the given inputs and specific conditions. Specifically, it calculates `ans` by considering the positions of the chosen vertices, their adjacent vertices, and the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices. If there are gaps greater than 1, it adjusts `ans` by subtracting half of these gaps up to the value of `y`. The function then prints the computed `ans` for each test case.
