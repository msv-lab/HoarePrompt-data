Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are positive integers satisfying 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the input consists of t test cases, where for each test case, the first line contains n, x, and y, followed by the second line containing x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
