You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 997\), `a` is the last input integer \(a_{input}\), `b` is the last input integer \(b_{input}\), `c` is the last input integer \(c_{input}\). After executing the loop, the program will have processed all inputs up to the \(t\)th input, and if none of the conditions `a < b < c`, `a < b` and `b > c` were met for any input, the program will print 'NONE' for all remaining iterations without changing the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range [0, 9]. For each test case, it checks if the integers satisfy one of two conditions: either \(a < b < c\) (in which case it prints "STAIR") or \(a < b\) and \(b > c\) (in which case it prints "PEAK"). If neither condition is met for a given test case, it prints "NONE" for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case based on the conditions specified. If \(t\) is 1000, the function will handle exactly 1000 test cases; otherwise, it will process up to \(t\) test cases. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
