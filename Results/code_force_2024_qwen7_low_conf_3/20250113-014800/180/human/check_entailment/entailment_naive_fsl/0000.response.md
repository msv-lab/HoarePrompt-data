Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program has a logical error in the conditions used to determine whether the digits form a stair or a peak. Specifically, the condition `elif a < b and b > c:` will always evaluate to `False` because `b` cannot simultaneously be greater than both `a` and `c` in a valid peak scenario. This means that the program will incorrectly categorize some valid peak cases as "NONE".

For example, consider the input `3 4 1`. According to the problem description, this should be categorized as a "PEAK" because `3 < 4 > 1`. However, the current implementation will categorize it as "NONE" because `a < b and b > c` is never true for this case.

To fix this, the conditions should be checked separately:
- For a stair: `a < b < c`
- For a peak: `a < b and b > c`

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version should properly handle all cases according to the problem description.
