Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is true.
   - It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints "PEAK" if both conditions are true.
   - If neither of these conditions is satisfied, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case as required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given constraints (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).
   - It correctly distinguishes between "STAIR", "PEAK", and "NONE" based on the specified conditions.

Since the program accurately follows the problem description and handles all test cases as required, the program is correct.
