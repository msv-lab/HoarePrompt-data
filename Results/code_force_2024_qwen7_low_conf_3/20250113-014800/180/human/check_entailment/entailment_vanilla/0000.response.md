### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires determining if three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither based on specific conditions.
   - A stair satisfies \(a < b < c\).
   - A peak satisfies \(a < b > c\).

2. **Program Verification**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates over each test case, reading three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the input.
   - It checks the conditions for a stair and a peak using nested `if` statements.
     - If \(a < b < c\), it prints "STAIR".
     - If \(a < b > c\), it prints "PEAK".
     - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where the conditions for a stair or a peak do not match, and it correctly outputs "NONE".
   - The conditions are checked in a way that ensures no other combination besides "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" is printed.

4. **Input and Output Format**:
   - The program follows the specified input format, reading `t` test cases and then processing each case accordingly.
   - The output format matches the required format of printing "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
