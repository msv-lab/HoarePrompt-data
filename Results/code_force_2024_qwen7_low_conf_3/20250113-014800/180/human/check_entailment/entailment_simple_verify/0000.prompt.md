You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 997\), `a` is the last input integer \(a_{input}\), `b` is the last input integer \(b_{input}\), `c` is the last input integer \(c_{input}\). After executing the loop, the program will have processed all inputs up to the \(t\)th input, and if none of the conditions `a < b < c`, `a < b` and `b > c` were met for any input, the program will print 'NONE' for all remaining iterations without changing the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program has a logical error in the conditions used to determine whether the digits form a stair or a peak. Specifically, the condition `elif a < b and b > c:` will always evaluate to `False` because `b` cannot simultaneously be greater than both `a` and `c` in a valid peak scenario. This means that the program will incorrectly categorize some valid peak cases as "NONE".

For example, consider the input `3 4 1`. According to the problem description, this should be categorized as a "PEAK" because `3 < 4 > 1`. However, the current implementation will categorize it as "NONE" because `a < b and b > c` is never true for this case.

To fix this, the conditions should be checked separately:
- For a stair: `a < b < c`
- For a peak: `a < b and b > c`

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version should properly handle all cases according to the problem description.
