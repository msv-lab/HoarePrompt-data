You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range [0, 9]. For each test case, it checks if the integers satisfy one of two conditions: either \(a < b < c\) (in which case it prints "STAIR") or \(a < b\) and \(b > c\) (in which case it prints "PEAK"). If neither condition is met for a given test case, it prints "NONE" for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case based on the conditions specified. If \(t\) is 1000, the function will handle exactly 1000 test cases; otherwise, it will process up to \(t\) test cases. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires determining if three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither based on specific conditions.
   - A stair satisfies \(a < b < c\).
   - A peak satisfies \(a < b > c\).

2. **Program Verification**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates over each test case, reading three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the input.
   - It checks the conditions for a stair and a peak using nested `if` statements.
     - If \(a < b < c\), it prints "STAIR".
     - If \(a < b > c\), it prints "PEAK".
     - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where the conditions for a stair or a peak do not match, and it correctly outputs "NONE".
   - The conditions are checked in a way that ensures no other combination besides "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" is printed.

4. **Input and Output Format**:
   - The program follows the specified input format, reading `t` test cases and then processing each case accordingly.
   - The output format matches the required format of printing "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
