Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer. If `a < b < c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. Otherwise, if `a >= b` or `b >= c`, then either 'PEAK' or 'NONE' is printed depending on whether `a < b` and `b > c` hold true. If so, 'PEAK' is printed; otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
