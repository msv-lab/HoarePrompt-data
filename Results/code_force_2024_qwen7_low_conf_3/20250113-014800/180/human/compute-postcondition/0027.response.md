The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as indicated by its definition `def func():`. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function might internally handle values for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).

And the provided output cases are not explicitly stated but implied by the nature of the problem.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but handles internal values for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9.**
