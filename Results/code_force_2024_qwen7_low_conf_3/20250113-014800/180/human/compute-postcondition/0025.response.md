Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 998\); `a` is `a_input`; `b` is `b_input`; `c` is `c_input`. If `a < b < c`, the program does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t`. Otherwise, the program prints 'PEAK' and does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t`.***
