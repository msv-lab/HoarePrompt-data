The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the input is split into three integers, the initial values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are replaced by the new values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 999, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user.**
