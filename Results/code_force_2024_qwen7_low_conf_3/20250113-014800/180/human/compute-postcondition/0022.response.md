The code `print('PEAK')` does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It simply prints the string 'PEAK' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq t \leq 998 \); `a` is `a_input`; `b` is `b_input`; `c` is `c_input`; print statement outputs 'PEAK'**
