Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop control variable and its initial state:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop control variable, which means it doesn't use the variable inside the loop (it's a common practice when you don't need the index value).
   - The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is the integer input from the user.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - Given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, we know that `t` is always positive.

3. **Adjust the states needed for the loop to execute:**
   - Since `t` must be a positive integer, we confirm that `t` should be set to any value within the given range to ensure the loop can execute.
   - No other state needs to be specifically adjusted because the loop control variable (`_`) is not used in the loop body, and there are no other variables involved in the loop condition.

Therefore, the required state adjustment is simply ensuring that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
