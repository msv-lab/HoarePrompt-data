According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop runs for each value of `t` from 1 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so that it is still within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are inputs and not modified by the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
