The code snippet `print('PEAK')` does not change the values of any variables. It only prints 'PEAK' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, the condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true, and the value of `a` is less than `b` and the value of `b` is greater than `c`. The print statement 'PEAK' is executed.**
