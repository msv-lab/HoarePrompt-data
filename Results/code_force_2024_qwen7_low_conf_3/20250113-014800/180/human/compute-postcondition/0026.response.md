Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 997\), `a` is the last input integer \(a_{input}\), `b` is the last input integer \(b_{input}\), `c` is the last input integer \(c_{input}\). After executing the loop, the program will have processed all inputs up to the \(t\)th input, and if none of the conditions `a < b < c`, `a < b` and `b > c` were met for any input, the program will print 'NONE' for all remaining iterations without changing the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
