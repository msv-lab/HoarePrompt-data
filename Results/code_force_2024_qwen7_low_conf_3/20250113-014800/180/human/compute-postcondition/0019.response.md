Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States**: The initial states given are:
   - \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 999 \)
   - \( a \) is an input integer
   - \( b \) is an input integer
   - \( c \) is an input integer
   - The values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the integers entered by the user
   - If \( a < b < c \), the program prints 'STAIR'. Otherwise, it prints 'PEAK' or 'NONE'

2. **Loop Structure**: The loop structure is:
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs \( t \) times, and the loop variable (in this case, `_`) simply increments from 0 to \( t-1 \). The condition for the loop to continue does not depend on any specific variables but rather on the value of \( t \).

4. **State Transition**:
   - At the end of each iteration, the value of \( t \) decreases by 1 because the loop runs \( t \) times and then stops when \( t \) becomes 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( t \) must be greater than 0.

5. **Updated State**: Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, \( t \) must be reduced by 1, making it \( t-1 \).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq t \leq 998 \), `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**. 

The value of \( t \) must be adjusted to \( t-1 \) for the loop to execute one more time.
