The code `print('PEAK')` prints the string 'PEAK' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables, it only outputs text. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the string 'PEAK' has been printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user. Printed: 'PEAK'**
