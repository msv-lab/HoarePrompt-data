The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in this operation. Therefore, the value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
