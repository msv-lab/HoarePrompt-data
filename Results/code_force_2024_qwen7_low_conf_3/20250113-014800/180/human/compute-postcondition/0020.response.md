The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the input values for `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified in the initial state, we can denote them as `a_input`, `b_input`, and `c_input`, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq t \leq 998 \); `a` is `a_input`; `b` is `b_input`; `c` is `c_input`**
