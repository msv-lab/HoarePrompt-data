Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `sub_s` is `s` with the first character removed. If there is no binary number `v` in `V` such that the count of '1' in `sub_s` equals the integer value of `v` when converted from base 2, `valid` is `False`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as is when the if condition is not met.***
