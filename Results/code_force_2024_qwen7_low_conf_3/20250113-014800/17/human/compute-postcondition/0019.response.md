The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current block.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` is within the range 1 to 20; `sub_s` is the string `s` with its first character removed; `valid` is `False`.**
