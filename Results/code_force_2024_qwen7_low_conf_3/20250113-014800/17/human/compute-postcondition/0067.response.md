Postcondition: **`valid` is `True`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, both `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 and is now `1`, and the length of `s` is at least `n`. The current value of `s[j]` is `'1'`**
