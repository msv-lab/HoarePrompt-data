Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `sub_s` is the string `s` with its second character removed, `valid` is either False (if none of the values in `V` satisfy the condition where the count of '1' in `sub_s` equals the binary value of `v`), or `valid` remains unchanged (since there is no else part, this case does not alter `valid`).***
