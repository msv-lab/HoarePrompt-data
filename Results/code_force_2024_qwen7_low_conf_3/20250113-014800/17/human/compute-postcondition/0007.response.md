The code snippet `valid = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `valid`. This does not affect the values of `V` or `s`. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`V` is a list of exactly \(2^n - 1\) binary strings, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `s` is a binary string of length `n` with leading zeros added, `valid` is `True`.**
