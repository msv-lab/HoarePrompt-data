Postcondition: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `valid` is `True`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the last character removed, `S` remains unchanged, and there is no substring in `V` where the count of '1's in `sub_s` equals the integer value of that substring in binary**
