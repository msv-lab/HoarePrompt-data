Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n-1`, `valid` is `False` if there is no value `v` in `V` such that the count of '1's in `sub_s` equals `v` when `v` is interpreted as an integer. Otherwise, `valid` remains `True`. `sub_s` is the string `s` with the first character removed, and `S` remains unchanged.***
