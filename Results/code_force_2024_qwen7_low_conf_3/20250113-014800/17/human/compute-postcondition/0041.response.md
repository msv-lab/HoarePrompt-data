`valid` is assigned the value `False`. This changes the value of `valid` from `True` to `False`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `valid` is `False`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the last character removed, `S` remains unchanged, and there is no substring in `V` where the count of '1's in `sub_s` equals the integer value of that substring in binary.**
