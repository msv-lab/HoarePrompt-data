Postcondition: ***`j` is `n-1`, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `s` is a binary string of length `n` with leading zeros added, `valid` is `True` unless there is any `'1'` in `s` such that there is no corresponding `v` in `V` where the count of `'1'`s in `sub_s` (constructed by removing the `j`th character from `s`) equals the integer value of `v` when converted from binary, and the condition `(valid)` is true***
