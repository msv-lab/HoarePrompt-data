Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer \( v_i \) satisfies 0 ≤ \( v_i \) < 2^(n+1). The function generates all binary strings of length `n` that satisfy the following condition: for each bit set to '1', the number of '1's in the resulting binary string after removing that bit should exist in the list `V`. The generated binary strings are then sorted and printed, along with their integer representations.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality included:

- The function iterates through all possible binary strings of length `n` using `range(2 ** n)`.
- For each binary string, it checks if the number of '1's matches any value in `V` after removing that '1'.
- If a binary string satisfies the condition, it is added to the list `S`.
- After the loop, `S` is sorted and printed, with each element converted back to its integer representation.

The provided annotation is mostly correct but could be more concise. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `S` is a sorted list of binary strings that satisfy the given conditions, and these binary strings have been printed in their integer form.
