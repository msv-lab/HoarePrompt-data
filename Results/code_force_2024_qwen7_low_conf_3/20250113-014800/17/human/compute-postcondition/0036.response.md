The code `valid = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `valid`. The values of the other variables (`j`, `n`, `s`, and `S`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `valid` is `True`, and `S` remains unchanged.**
