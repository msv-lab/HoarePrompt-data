Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `sub_s` is the string `s` with its second character removed, and `valid` remains unchanged. If the character at index `j` in `s` is '1', `valid` remains unchanged; otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged as well since there is no else part altering it.***
