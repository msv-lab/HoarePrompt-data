The code `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` modifies the value of `sub_s`. Given the initial state where `j` is 2 and `sub_s` is the string `s` with its first character removed, we can deduce that `sub_s` is currently `s[1:]` (the string `s` starting from the second character).

Since `j` is 2, the new value of `sub_s` will be the string `s` starting from the first character up to the character before the third one, effectively removing the second character from the original string `s`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `sub_s` is the string `s` with its second character removed, `valid` remains unchanged.**
