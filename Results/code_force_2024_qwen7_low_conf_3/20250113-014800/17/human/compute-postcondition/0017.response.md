The code `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` modifies the string `s` by creating a substring `sub_s` that excludes the character at index `j`. Given that `j` is 1, this means that `sub_s` will be the string `s` with its first character removed.

Since the initial state of `j` is 1 and `n` is within the range 1 to 20, the value of `j` does not change, and `n` remains within the same range. The variable `s` is transformed into `sub_s`, but no specific value for `s` or `sub_s` is provided.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` is within the range 1 to 20; `sub_s` is the string `s` with its first character removed.**
