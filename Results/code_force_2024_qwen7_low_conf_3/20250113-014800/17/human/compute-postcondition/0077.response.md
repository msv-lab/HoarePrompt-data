The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables directly but rather breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is inside. Given that no such context is provided in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `valid` is `False`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `2`, `sub_s` is either `'10'` if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`.
