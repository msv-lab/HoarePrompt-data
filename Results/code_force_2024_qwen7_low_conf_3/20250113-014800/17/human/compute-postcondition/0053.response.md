`valid` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `j`, `n`, `s`, `sub_s`, and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n-1`, `valid` is `False`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the first character removed, and `S` remains unchanged.
