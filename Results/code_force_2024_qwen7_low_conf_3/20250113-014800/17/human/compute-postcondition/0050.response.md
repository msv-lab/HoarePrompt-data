Postcondition: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n-1`, `valid` is `True`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the last character removed, and `S` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition directly takes the postcondition from the if part. The if condition checks if `s[j]` is `'1'`. If true, then `valid` is set to `True`. Given that `j` is `n-1` and `s` has its last character removed to form `sub_s`, the postcondition is as stated above.
