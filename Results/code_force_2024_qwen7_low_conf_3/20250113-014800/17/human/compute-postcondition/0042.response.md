The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or the most nested loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only impact is that we break out of any existing loop or conditional block. However, since no such block is present, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `valid` is `False`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the last character removed, `S` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
