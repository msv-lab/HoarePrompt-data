The code `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` creates a substring `sub_s` by removing the character at index `j` from the string `s`. Given that `j` is `1` and the current value of `s[j]` is `'1'`, the character `'1'` at index `1` in `s` will be removed.

From the initial state, we know:
- `valid` is `True`
- `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`
- `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`
- `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged
- `j` is incremented by 1 and is now `1`
- The length of `s` is at least `n`

Since `s[j]` is `'1'` and `j` is `1`, the updated string `sub_s` will be the string `s` without the character `'1'` at index `1`.

Let's consider the two cases for `s`:

1. If `s` is `'10'`:
   - Removing the character `'1'` at index `1` gives us `sub_s = '0'`.
   
2. If `s` is `'1'` followed by `n-2` zeros (making the total length `n`):
   - Removing the character `'1'` at index `1` gives us `sub_s = '0'` followed by `n-2` zeros, i.e., `sub_s = '0' * (n-1)`.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the original value of `s`. However, since we are asked to provide a general answer based on the given information, we can represent the updated state as follows:

Output State: **`valid` is `True`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `1`, and `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `1` removed.**
