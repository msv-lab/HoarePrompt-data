The code snippet `V = [bin(i)[2:] for i in V]` impacts the list `V` by converting each integer `i` in `V` from its decimal representation to its binary representation, stripping off the '0b' prefix. The initial state specifies that `V` is a list of `2^n - 1` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies `0 <= v_i < 2^(n+1)`. After executing the code, each element in `V` will be converted to its binary string form without the '0b' prefix.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The length of the list `V` is `2^n - 1`.
2. Each element `i` in the list `V` is a decimal integer in the range `[0, 2^(n+1) - 1]`.
3. The code converts each integer `i` in `V` to its binary string representation using `bin(i)[2:]`.

Since the exact values of `V` are not given, we can express the updated state in terms of the original values and the transformation applied.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `V` is a list of `2^n - 1` binary strings, where each string is the binary representation (without '0b') of an integer in the original list `V`.**
