The code snippet `S.append(bin(int(s, 2) + 1)[2:])` has the following impact:

1. Convert the binary string `s` to an integer using `int(s, 2)`.
2. Add 1 to this integer.
3. Convert the resulting integer back to a binary string using `bin()`.
4. Remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string using `[2:]`.
5. Append this new binary string to the list `S`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is within the range 1 to 20
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` with leading zeros added
- `valid` is `True` unless there is any `'1'` in `s` such that there is no corresponding `v` in `V` where the count of `'1'`s in `sub_s` (constructed by removing the `j`th character from `s`) equals the integer value of `v` when converted from binary, and the condition `(valid)` is true

Let's denote the initial value of `s` as `initial_s`. After converting `s` to an integer, adding 1, converting back to binary, and removing the '0b' prefix, the new binary string is appended to `S`. Since `s` was a binary string of length `n`, let's denote the new binary string as `new_s`.

The output state after the code execution is:
- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is within the range 1 to 20
- `s` is unchanged, which is `initial_s`
- `valid` remains unchanged, meaning it is `True` unless there is any `'1'` in `s` such that there is no corresponding `v` in `V` where the count of `'1'`s in `sub_s` (constructed by removing the `j`th character from `s`) equals the integer value of `v` when converted from binary, and the condition `(valid)` is true
- `S` now contains the original value of `s` and the new binary string `new_s`

Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `s` is `initial_s`, `valid` is `True` unless there is any `'1'` in `s` such that there is no corresponding `v` in `V` where the count of `'1'`s in `sub_s` (constructed by removing the `j`th character from `s`) equals the integer value of `v` when converted from binary, and the condition `(valid)` is true, `S` is the original `S` plus the new binary string `new_s`**
