Postcondition: **`valid` is `True`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `1`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `1` removed, and there is no element `v` in `V` such that the count of '1's in `sub_s` is equal to the integer value of `v` when `v` is interpreted as a binary number**.
