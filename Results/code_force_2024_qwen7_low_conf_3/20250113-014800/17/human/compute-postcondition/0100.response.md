The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `V`, which is a list of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer \( v_i \) satisfies 0 <= \( v_i \) < 2^(n+1). The function does not specify a return value directly but rather describes different cases based on the input. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range 1 to 20, and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers, and based on the values in `V`, it processes the input according to certain conditions (though no specific return values are mentioned in the output description).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer \( v_i \) satisfies 0 <= \( v_i \) < 2^(n+1).**
