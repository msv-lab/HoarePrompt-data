The code `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` removes the character at index `j` from the string `s`. Given that `j` is 0, this means the character '1' at index 0 will be removed from the string `s`.

- The initial state is: `j` is 0, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, the value of `s[j]` is '1'.
- After executing the code, `s[j]` will no longer be '1', and `sub_s` will be the string `s` with the first character removed.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `j` remains 0.
- `n` remains within the range 1 to 20.
- `s[j]` is no longer '1'; instead, `sub_s` is the modified version of `s` without the first character.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is within the range 1 to 20; `sub_s` is `s` with the first character removed.**
