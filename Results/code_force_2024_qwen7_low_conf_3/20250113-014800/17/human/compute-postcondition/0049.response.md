Postcondition: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n-1`, `valid` is `True`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the last character removed, and `S` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: Since the else part does not exist, the if condition directly sets `valid` to `True`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `s`, `sub_s`, and `S`) remain unchanged as per the precondition.
