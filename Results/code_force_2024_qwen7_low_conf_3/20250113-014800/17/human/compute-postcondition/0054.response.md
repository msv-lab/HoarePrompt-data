The code `break` does not affect any variable values directly. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or loop-like structure it is in. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n-1`, `valid` is `False`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the first character removed, and `S` remains unchanged.**
