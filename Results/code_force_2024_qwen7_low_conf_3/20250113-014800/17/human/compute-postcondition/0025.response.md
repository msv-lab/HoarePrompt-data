The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the only effect is that the execution will break out of any enclosing loop or conditional block. However, since there is no enclosing loop or conditional block mentioned in the initial state, the only thing that can be inferred is that the `break` statement will cause the program to exit the current context.

Given that the initial state includes `j` is 2, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `sub_s` is the string `s` with its second character removed, and `valid` is False, and considering that no changes are made to these variables by the `break` statement, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `sub_s` is the string `s` with its second character removed, `valid` is False.**
