Postcondition: ***`valid` is a boolean, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1` if `valid` is true, and `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, both `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, if the length of `s` is less than `n`. Otherwise, the same conditions hold as in the if part.***
