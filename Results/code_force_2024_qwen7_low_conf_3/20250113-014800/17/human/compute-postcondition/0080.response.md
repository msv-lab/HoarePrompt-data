Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Variables and Their States:**
   - `valid` is `False`.
   - `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`.
   - `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`.
   - `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged.
   - `j` is `2`.
   - `sub_s` is either `'10'` if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`.
   - If `s[j] == '1'`, then `valid` remains `False`; otherwise, the conditions described in the if part apply.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the New State After One Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `2`.
   - The loop will execute again for `j = 3`.

4. **Adjust the States Based on the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `3`.
   - `s` and `sub_s` depend on the current value of `j`. Since `j` is now `3`, we need to update `sub_s` accordingly.
     - If `s` is `'10'`, `sub_s` remains `'10'`.
     - If `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`, `sub_s` becomes a string of zeros of length `n-1`.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `valid` remains `False` unless certain conditions in the if part are met.
   - `S` remains unchanged.
   - `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged.
   - `j` is now `3`.
   - `sub_s` updates based on the current value of `s`.

6. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `valid` is `False`.
   - `S` remains unchanged.
   - `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged.
   - `j` is `3`.
   - `sub_s` is updated based on the value of `s`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`valid` is `False`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `3`, `sub_s` is either `'10'` if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`**.
