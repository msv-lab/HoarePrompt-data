The code appends the binary string representation of the integer value of `s` plus one, without the '0b' prefix, to the list `S`. 

Given the initial state:
- `valid` is `True`
- `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(s, 2) + 1`
- `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`
- `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged
- `j` is `n`
- `sub_s` is either an empty string if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`
- The loop checks if removing each '1' from `s` results in a substring that does not match any value in `V` in terms of the count of '1's.

After executing the line of code:
- `S` is updated with the new element, which is the binary string representation of `int(s, 2) + 1`
- `valid` remains `True` unless the condition in the loop fails, but no such condition is present here
- `s` remains unchanged
- `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged
- `j` remains `n`
- `sub_s` remains unchanged

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`valid` is `True`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(s, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is either an empty string if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`**.
