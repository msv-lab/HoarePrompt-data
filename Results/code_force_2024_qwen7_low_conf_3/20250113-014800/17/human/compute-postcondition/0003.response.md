The code snippet `s = bin(i)[2:]` does the following:

1. Converts the integer `i` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function.
2. Slices the binary string from the third character to the end (`[2:]`), removing the '0b' prefix.

However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`. Therefore, `s` will be the binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix, and the exact value of `s` cannot be determined without knowing `i`.

The other variables, `V` and `n`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`V` is a list of exactly \(2^n - 1\) binary strings, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `s` is the binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix.**
