According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s` is a binary string of length `n-1`
- `valid` is `True`
- `sub_s` is the string `s` with the last character removed
- `S` remains unchanged

To determine the states at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the changes that occur when the loop runs once.

1. The variable `j` starts from `n-1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. Since `j` is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `j` is now 0 at the start of the next iteration (if there is one).
2. For the loop to continue, `j` must still be within the range defined by `range(n)`, which means `j` must be less than `n`.

Since `j` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, the loop can still execute if `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no change is needed in `n`.

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` will be 0 (since it decreases by 1 each iteration)
- `s` remains a binary string of length `n-1`
- `valid` remains `True`
- `sub_s` remains the string `s` with the last character removed
- `S` remains unchanged

State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n-1`, `valid` is `True`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the last character removed, and `S` remains unchanged**
