The given code initializes an empty list `S`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `V`. The only change is that `S` is now an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is an empty list.**
