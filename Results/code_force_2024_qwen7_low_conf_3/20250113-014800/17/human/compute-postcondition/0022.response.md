Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is within the range 1 to 20
   - `sub_s` is the string `s` with its first character removed
   - If none of the values in `V` matches the count of '1' in `sub_s` (where each value in `V` is converted from binary), then `valid` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. So, `j` becomes 2.
   - The condition for `n` is that it must be within the range 1 to 20. This does not change unless specified otherwise in the loop body.
   - `sub_s` is derived from `s` and does not change based on the loop itself but rather how it is updated inside the loop.
   - The state of `valid` is only affected if the condition regarding the count of '1' in `sub_s` is checked. Since we are only starting a new iteration and not executing the loop body, `valid` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `sub_s` is the string `s` with its first character removed, `valid` remains unchanged.**
