Postcondition: ***`valid` is `False`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `3`, `sub_s` is either `'1'` if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`, and if none of the values in `V` match the count of `'1'` in `sub_s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
