Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( j \) is \( n-1 \)
   - \( n \) must be greater than 0
   - \( s \) is a binary string of length \( n \)
   - \( valid \) is \( False \)
   - \( sub_s \) is the string \( s \) with the last character removed
   - \( S \) remains unchanged

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over \( j \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).

3. **Current State of \( j \):**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( j \) is \( n-1 \).

4. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, \( j \) must be less than \( n \).
   - Since \( j \) is currently \( n-1 \), the loop will only execute again if \( j \) is incremented.

5. **Incrementing \( j \):**
   - If the loop executes again, \( j \) will be incremented from \( n-1 \) to \( n \).

6. **Adjusting Other Variables:**
   - \( n \) remains unchanged.
   - \( s \) remains unchanged.
   - \( valid \) remains unchanged.
   - \( sub_s \) remains unchanged (since it was derived from \( s \) and will not be modified in this loop iteration).
   - \( S \) remains unchanged.

7. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - \( j \) will be \( n \) (since it is incremented from \( n-1 \)).
   - \( n \) remains greater than 0.
   - \( s \) remains a binary string of length \( n \).
   - \( valid \) remains \( False \).
   - \( sub_s \) remains the string \( s \) with the last character removed.
   - \( S \) remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `valid` is `False`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the last character removed, and `S` remains unchanged.**
