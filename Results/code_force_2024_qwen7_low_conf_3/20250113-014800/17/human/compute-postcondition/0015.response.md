Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is within the range 1 to 20. If the first character of `s` is '1' and there is no binary number `v` in `V` such that the count of '1' in the substring `sub_s` (which is `s` with the first character removed) equals the integer value of `v` when converted from base 2, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the value of `valid` remains unchanged.***
