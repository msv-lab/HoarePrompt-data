Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` is within the range 1 to 20
   - If the first character of `s` is '1' and there is no binary number `v` in `V` such that the count of '1' in the substring `sub_s` (which is `s` with the first character removed) equals the integer value of `v` when converted from base 2, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the value of `valid` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j` in the range `range(n)`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 0 (the loop has just started or finished the first iteration)
   - `n` is still within the range 1 to 20
   - The condition for `valid` is based on the string `s` and the set `V`.

4. **For the Loop to Execute One More Time:**
   - The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`.
   - Since `j` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still within the range 1 to 20.
   - The condition for `valid` does not change as it is based on `s` and `V`, which are external to the loop and thus remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 1, `n` is within the range 1 to 20**
