Output State: **`valid` is `False`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is either an empty string if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`, and the loop checks if removing each '1' from `s` results in a substring that does not match any value in `V` in terms of the count of '1's.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the string `s` using `j` as the index. For each iteration, it checks if the character at index `j` is '1'. If so, it removes that character and checks if the resulting substring has a count of '1's that matches any value in `V`.
2. **Break Condition**: If a match is found, the loop breaks and `valid` is set to `False`. Since the problem specifies that the loop executes some number of times, and the provided output states indicate that `valid` remains `False` after multiple iterations, we conclude that the loop eventually breaks due to a match being found.
3. **Final Values**:
   - `valid`: Set to `False` after the loop finds a match.
   - `S`: Includes the new element, which is the binary string representation of `int(binary_str, 2) + 1`.
   - `s`: Remains unchanged in the loop's context but is considered final based on the loop's termination condition.
   - `binary_str` and `i`: Remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `j`: Will be `n` after the loop finishes.
   - `sub_s`: Will be either an empty string if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`.

Since the loop is designed to check all possible substrings by removing each '1', and the output states indicate that `valid` remains `False`, we conclude that the loop will always find a match and terminate early.
