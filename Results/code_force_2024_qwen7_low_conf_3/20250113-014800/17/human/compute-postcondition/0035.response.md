Postcondition: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` is within the range 1 to 20, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `valid` is `True`, and `S` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: 
- If `len(s) < n`, then `s` must be a binary string of length `n` because this is the condition that triggers the if part.
- If `len(s) >= n`, the else part does not exist, so the original conditions remain unchanged.
