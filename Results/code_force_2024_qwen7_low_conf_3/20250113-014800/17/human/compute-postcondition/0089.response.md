Postcondition: ***`valid` is `True`, `S` includes a new element which is the binary string representation of `int(s, 2) + 1`, `s` is either `'10'` or a string of zeros appended to `'10'` making its total length `n`, `binary_str` and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is either an empty string if `s` is `'10'`, or a string of zeros of length `n-1` if `s` is `'10' + '0' * (n - 2)`***.
