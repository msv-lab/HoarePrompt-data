Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem.

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `n` and `V`. This matches the problem description.
   - `V` is converted from integers to binary strings. This step is necessary for easier manipulation of binary representations.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Sets S**:
   - A loop runs over all possible subsets of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` by iterating over binary strings of length `n`.
   - Each subset is represented as a binary string, and if the string length is less than `n`, it pads the string with leading zeros.

3. **Checking Validity of Subset S**:
   - For each bit position `j` in the subset representation (`s`), if the bit at position `j` is `1`, it checks whether the count of `1`s in the subset without the `j`-th bit matches any value in `V` at index `f(T)`, where `T` is the subset without the `j`-th bit.
   - If a match is found, the subset `S` is considered valid.

4. **Collecting Valid Subsets**:
   - Valid subsets are collected in the list `S`.

5. **Sorting and Outputting Results**:
   - The list `S` is sorted and printed. Each element is the binary representation of the subset, which is converted back to an integer before printing.

Given this analysis, the provided program seems to follow the correct logic for solving the problem. It iterates through all possible subsets, checks the condition for each subset, and outputs the valid subsets in the correct format.

Correctness: **True**
