You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Define the binary encoding of a finite set of natural numbers T \subseteq
\\{0,1,2,\ldots\\} as f(T) = \sum\limits_{i \in T} 2^i . For example,
f(\\{0,2\\}) = 2^0 + 2^2 = 5 and f(\\{\\}) = 0 . Notice that f is a bijection
from all such sets to all non-negative integers. As such, f^{-1} is also
defined.

You are given an integer n along with 2^n-1 sets V_1,V_2,\ldots,V_{2^n-1} .

Find all sets S that satisfy the following constraint:

  * S \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} . Note that S can be empty. 
  * For all non-empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} , |S \cap T| \in V_{f(T)} . 

Due to the large input and output, both input and output will be given in
terms of binary encodings of the sets.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20 ).

The second line of input contains 2^n-1 integers v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{2^n-1} (0
\leq v_i < 2^{n+1} ) — the sets V_i given in their binary encoding where V_i =
f^{-1}(v_i) .

Output

The first line of output should contain an integer k indicating the number of
possible S .

In the following k lines, you should output f(S) for all possible S in
increasing order.

Note

In the first test case, one possible S is f^{-1}(3) = \\{0,1\\} . All the non-
empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,2\\} and the corresponding |S \cap T| , f(T)
and V_f(T) are as follows:

T | |S\cap T| | f(T) | V_{f(T)}   
---|---|---|---  
\\{0\\} | 1 | 1 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1\\} | 1 | 2 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{2\\} | 0 | 4 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1\\} | 2 | 3 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,2\\} | 1 | 5 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1,2\\} | 1 | 6 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1,2\\} | 2 | 7 | \\{2,3\\}

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S` is a non-empty sorted list of binary strings, `s` is the last (or any) element of `S`, `valid` is `False`, `i` is the length of `S` + 1; each binary string in `S` has been converted to its integer representation and printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer \( v_i \) satisfies 0 ≤ \( v_i \) < 2^(n+1). The function generates all binary strings of length `n` that satisfy the following condition: for each bit set to '1', the number of '1's in the resulting binary string after removing that bit should exist in the list `V`. The generated binary strings are then sorted and printed, along with their integer representations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `V` contains values that do not match the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the program checks if the count of '1's in a subset `sub_s` matches the value in `V`, but it does not consider the fact that `V_i = f^{-1}(v_i)` and thus the value in `V` should correspond to the count of '1's in `T`.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 3
V = [12]
```

The binary encoding `12` corresponds to the set `{0, 2}`. According to the problem, for any subset `T` of `{0, 1, 2}`, the size of the intersection `|S ∩ T|` must be in `V_{f(T)}`. However, the program does not check this condition properly. It only checks if the count of '1's in `sub_s` matches the value in `V`, without considering the specific constraints of `V`.

To illustrate, let's take the subset `T = {0, 1, 2}` which has `f(T) = 7` and `V_7 = 12`. The program would incorrectly validate `S = {0, 1}` because it only checks if the count of '1's in `sub_s` (which is `1`) matches the value in `V`, without considering the specific constraints of `V`.

The correct approach should involve checking if the count of '1's in each subset `T` matches the value in `V` corresponding to `f(T)`. The current implementation fails to do this properly.
