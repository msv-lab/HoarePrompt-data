Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find all sets \( S \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\} \) such that for every non-empty subset \( T \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\} \), the size of the intersection \( |S \cap T| \) is in \( V_{f(T)} \). Here, \( f(T) \) is the binary encoding of the set \( T \).

2. **Binary Encoding and Decoding**:
   - Each set \( T \) is represented by a binary number, where the \( i \)-th bit being 1 means \( i \in T \).
   - Given \( V_i \), we need to ensure that for every subset \( T \) of \( \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\} \), the count of 1s in \( S \) that are also in \( T \) (i.e., \( |S \cap T| \)) is equal to the value \( V_{f(T)} \).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over all possible binary strings of length \( n \) (i.e., all subsets of \( \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\} \)).
   - For each binary string \( s \), it checks whether setting any specific bit to 1 would violate the condition. If not, it considers the string as a potential candidate for \( S \).
   - After filtering out invalid strings, it sorts and prints the valid binary strings, converting them to integers.

4. **Checking the Implementation**:
   - The code correctly handles the conversion of integers to binary strings and vice versa.
   - It iterates over all possible subsets and checks the condition using binary operations.
   - The logic for checking if a binary string \( s \) is valid (i.e., ensuring \( |S \cap T| \in V_{f(T)} \) for all subsets \( T \)) is implemented correctly.

5. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where \( S \) might be empty or have different sizes.
   - The sorting and printing of results is done correctly.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find all valid sets \( S \) based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
