You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Define the binary encoding of a finite set of natural numbers T \subseteq
\\{0,1,2,\ldots\\} as f(T) = \sum\limits_{i \in T} 2^i . For example,
f(\\{0,2\\}) = 2^0 + 2^2 = 5 and f(\\{\\}) = 0 . Notice that f is a bijection
from all such sets to all non-negative integers. As such, f^{-1} is also
defined.

You are given an integer n along with 2^n-1 sets V_1,V_2,\ldots,V_{2^n-1} .

Find all sets S that satisfy the following constraint:

  * S \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} . Note that S can be empty. 
  * For all non-empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} , |S \cap T| \in V_{f(T)} . 

Due to the large input and output, both input and output will be given in
terms of binary encodings of the sets.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20 ).

The second line of input contains 2^n-1 integers v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{2^n-1} (0
\leq v_i < 2^{n+1} ) — the sets V_i given in their binary encoding where V_i =
f^{-1}(v_i) .

Output

The first line of output should contain an integer k indicating the number of
possible S .

In the following k lines, you should output f(S) for all possible S in
increasing order.

Note

In the first test case, one possible S is f^{-1}(3) = \\{0,1\\} . All the non-
empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,2\\} and the corresponding |S \cap T| , f(T)
and V_f(T) are as follows:

T | |S\cap T| | f(T) | V_{f(T)}   
---|---|---|---  
\\{0\\} | 1 | 1 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1\\} | 1 | 2 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{2\\} | 0 | 4 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1\\} | 2 | 3 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,2\\} | 1 | 5 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1,2\\} | 1 | 6 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1,2\\} | 2 | 7 | \\{2,3\\}

# Program:
import itertools

print('Test Case 1:')
func_1(3, [15] * 7)
print('\nTest Case 2:')
func_1(5, [63] * 16)

def func_1(n, V):
    V = [bin(i)[2:] for i in V]
    S = []
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        s = bin(i)[2:]
        if len(s) < n:
            s = '0' * (n - len(s)) + s
        valid = True
        for j in range(n):
            if s[j] == '1':
                sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]
                if not any((sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2) for v in V)):
                    valid = False
                    break
        if valid:
            S.append(bin(int(s, 2) + 1)[2:])
    S.sort()
    print(len(S))
    for s in S:
        print(int(s, 2))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer \( v_i \) satisfies 0 ≤ \( v_i \) < 2^(n+1). The function generates all binary strings of length `n` that satisfy the following condition: for each bit set to '1', the number of '1's in the resulting binary string after removing that bit should exist in the list `V`. The generated binary strings are then sorted and printed, along with their integer representations.
