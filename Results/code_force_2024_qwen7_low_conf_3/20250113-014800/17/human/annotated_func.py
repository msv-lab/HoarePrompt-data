#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and V is a list of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer v_i satisfies 0 <= v_i < 2^(n+1), representing the sets V_i in their binary encoding where V_i = f^{-1}(v_i).
def func_1(n, V):
    V = [bin(i)[2:] for i in V]
    S = []
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        s = bin(i)[2:]
        
        if len(s) < n:
            s = '0' * (n - len(s)) + s
        
        valid = True
        
        for j in range(n):
            if s[j] == '1':
                sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]
                if not any(sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2) for v in V):
                    valid = False
                    break
        
        if valid:
            S.append(bin(int(s, 2) + 1)[2:])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S` contains all binary strings of length `n` that satisfy the given conditions, `s` is an empty string, `valid` is `False`, `i` is `2
    S.sort()
    print(len(S))
    for s in S:
        print(int(s, 2))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S` is a non-empty sorted list of binary strings, `s` is the last (or any) element of `S`, `valid` is `False`, `i` is the length of `S` + 1; each binary string in `S` has been converted to its integer representation and printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer \( v_i \) satisfies 0 ≤ \( v_i \) < 2^(n+1). The function generates all binary strings of length `n` that satisfy the following condition: for each bit set to '1', the number of '1's in the resulting binary string after removing that bit should exist in the list `V`. The generated binary strings are then sorted and printed, along with their integer representations.
