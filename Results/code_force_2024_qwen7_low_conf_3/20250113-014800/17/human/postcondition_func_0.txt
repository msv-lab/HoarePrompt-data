The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer \( v_i \) satisfies 0 ≤ \( v_i \) < 2^(n+1). The function generates all binary strings of length `n` that satisfy the following condition: for each bit set to '1', the number of '1's in the resulting binary string after removing that bit should exist in the list `V`. The generated binary strings are then sorted and printed, along with their integer representations.
