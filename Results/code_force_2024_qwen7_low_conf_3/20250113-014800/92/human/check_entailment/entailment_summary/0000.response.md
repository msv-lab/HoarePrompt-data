Reasoning:
The provided code has a fundamental flaw in how it processes the input data. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the effect of the permutation `p` on the magic powers of the mushrooms. According to the problem statement, picking only `k` mushrooms will set the magic powers of the mushrooms at indices specified by the permutation `p` up to `k-1` to zero. This means that the `v_sorted` list generated by simply sorting `v` does not reflect the actual effective magic powers of the mushrooms after considering the permutation.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Sort the mushrooms based on their magic power in descending order.
2. Apply the permutation to zero out the magic powers of the first `k-1` mushrooms in the sorted list.
3. Calculate the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms required to achieve that strength.

Given this, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not properly handle the permutation `p` and thus cannot produce the correct result.

Correctness: **False**
