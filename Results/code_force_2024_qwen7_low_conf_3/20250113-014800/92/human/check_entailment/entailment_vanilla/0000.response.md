Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, the array `v` of mushroom powers, and the permutation `p`. This part is handled correctly.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It sorts the array `v` in descending order.
   - It iterates through the sorted array to calculate the potential strength of the elixir for each possible number of mushrooms (`i`) chosen.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the strength as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`.
   - It updates `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` based on the calculated strength and the current number of mushrooms.
3. **Output**: The program prints the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms required for each test case.

Given the logic in `func_1`, let's verify the correctness of the implementation:

- **Strength Calculation**: The strength calculation is done as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`, which is correct because it considers the product of the number of mushrooms (`i`) and the minimum magic power among them (`v_sorted[i - 1]`).
- **Tracking Maximum Strength and Minimum Mushrooms**: The program correctly tracks the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve this strength.
- **Logic Flow**: The logic flow is correct and handles the problem constraints appropriately.

Since the provided code accurately implements the required functionality without any logical errors or missing parts, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
