### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, the array `v` of mushroom powers, and the permutation `p`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sorting the Array**:
     - The function sorts the array `v` in descending order to get `v_sorted`. This is correct and necessary to ensure that the highest magic power is considered first.
   - **Iterating Through the Sorted Array**:
     - The function iterates through the sorted array to calculate the potential strength of the elixir for each possible number of mushrooms (`i`) chosen.
     - For each `i`, it calculates the strength as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`. This is correct because it considers the product of the number of mushrooms (`i`) and the minimum magic power among them (`v_sorted[i - 1]`).
   - **Tracking Maximum Strength and Minimum Mushrooms**:
     - The function updates `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` based on the calculated strength and the current number of mushrooms. This is correct because it keeps track of the best combination of mushrooms to maximize the strength while minimizing the number of mushrooms used.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`. There is no explicit check for these conditions, which could lead to errors if these assumptions are not met. However, since the problem guarantees valid inputs, this is acceptable.
     - The function also assumes that `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. While `p` is used to create `v_sorted`, the function does not validate that `p` is indeed a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. Again, since the problem guarantees valid inputs, this is acceptable.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms required for each test case. This is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis, the provided code accurately implements the required functionality without any logical errors or missing parts. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve this strength.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
