You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent
and went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.

It is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which
has magic power v_i . Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum
strength from the mushrooms.

The strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms
in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the
elixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.
Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order.

However, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation
of numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic
power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .
Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.

Your task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew
the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to
stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for
gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of
mushrooms.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from
1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a
permutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
200\,000 ) — the number of mushrooms.

The second line contains an array v of size n (1\le v_i \le 10^9 ) — the magic
powers of the mushrooms.

The third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two integers separated by a space — the maximum
strength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms
that Kirill needs to use for this.

Note

In the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so
the strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \cdot \min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \cdot
\min(9, 8) = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 . Note that the magic power of the mushroom with
index 3 after picking two mushrooms will become 0 .

    return max_strength, min_mushrooms
    #`The program returns max_strength which is the maximum value of i * v_sorted[i - 1] for i in the range [1, n]`, and min_mushrooms which is the smallest i such that i * v_sorted[i - 1] equals max_strength



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, the array `v` of mushroom powers, and the permutation `p`. This part is handled correctly.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It sorts the array `v` in descending order.
   - It iterates through the sorted array to calculate the potential strength of the elixir for each possible number of mushrooms (`i`) chosen.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the strength as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`.
   - It updates `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` based on the calculated strength and the current number of mushrooms.
3. **Output**: The program prints the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms required for each test case.

Given the logic in `func_1`, let's verify the correctness of the implementation:

- **Strength Calculation**: The strength calculation is done as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`, which is correct because it considers the product of the number of mushrooms (`i`) and the minimum magic power among them (`v_sorted[i - 1]`).
- **Tracking Maximum Strength and Minimum Mushrooms**: The program correctly tracks the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve this strength.
- **Logic Flow**: The logic flow is correct and handles the problem constraints appropriately.

Since the provided code accurately implements the required functionality without any logical errors or missing parts, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
