Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the permutation `p` affects the magic powers of the mushrooms. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the magic power of mushrooms at positions specified by `p` becomes zero after Kirill picks them. This means that the program incorrectly assumes that all mushrooms are available for selection, which violates the problem constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```
The correct approach would be to check the minimum magic power after each pick and ensure that the picked mushrooms' indices do not appear in the permutation `p`. The provided solution does not handle this correctly and thus gives an incorrect result.
