# Problem:
As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent
and went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.

It is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which
has magic power v_i . Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum
strength from the mushrooms.

The strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms
in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the
elixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.
Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order.

However, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation
of numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic
power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .
Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.

Your task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew
the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to
stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for
gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of
mushrooms.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from
1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a
permutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
200\,000 ) — the number of mushrooms.

The second line contains an array v of size n (1\le v_i \le 10^9 ) — the magic
powers of the mushrooms.

The third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two integers separated by a space — the maximum
strength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms
that Kirill needs to use for this.

Note

In the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so
the strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \cdot \min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \cdot
\min(9, 8) = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 . Note that the magic power of the mushroom with
index 3 after picking two mushrooms will become 0 .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, v, p)
    print(*result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, v is a list of positive integers of length n, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_1(n, v, p):
    v_sorted = sorted(v, reverse=True)
    max_strength = 0
    min_mushrooms = n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]
        
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            min_mushrooms = i
        elif strength == max_strength:
            min_mushrooms = min(min_mushrooms, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_strength` is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range `[1, n]`, `min_mushrooms` is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `strength` is not relevant after the loop, `total` is not relevant after the loop, `i` is `n + 1` since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
    return max_strength, min_mushrooms
    #`The program returns max_strength which is the maximum value of i * v_sorted[i - 1] for i in the range [1, n]`, and min_mushrooms which is the smallest i such that i * v_sorted[i - 1] equals max_strength
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `v` (a list of positive integers of length `n`), and `p` (a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`). The function returns two values: `max_strength` (the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range `[1, n]`) and `min_mushrooms` (the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`). 

Here is a step-by-step summary of the function's actions:
1. The function first sorts the list `v` in descending order to get `v_sorted`.
2. It initializes `max_strength` to 0 and `min_mushrooms` to `n`.
3. It iterates through the range `[1, n]`:
   - For each `i`, it calculates the strength as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`.
   - If the calculated strength is greater than `max_strength`, it updates `max_strength` to the new value and sets `min_mushrooms` to `i`.
   - If the calculated strength is equal to `max_strength`, it updates `min_mushrooms` to the smaller of its current value and `i`.
4. After the loop completes, it returns `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`. There is no explicit check for these conditions, which could lead to errors if these assumptions are not met.
- The function also assumes that `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. While `p` is used to create `v_sorted`, the function does not validate that `p` is indeed a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- If `v` contains duplicate elements, the function still correctly identifies the maximum strength and corresponding index, as the sorting ensures that the highest value is considered first.
