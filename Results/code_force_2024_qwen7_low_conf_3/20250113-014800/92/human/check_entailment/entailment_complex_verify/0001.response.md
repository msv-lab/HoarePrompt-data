Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, the array `v` of mushroom powers, and the permutation `p`. This part is handled correctly.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It sorts the array `v` in descending order.
   - It iterates through the sorted array to calculate the potential strength of the elixir for each possible number of mushrooms (`i`) chosen.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the strength as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`.
   - It updates `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` based on the calculated strength and the current number of mushrooms.
3. **Output**: The program prints the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms required for each test case.

Given the logic in `func_1`, let's verify the correctness of the implementation:

- **Strength Calculation**: The strength calculation is done as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`, which is correct because it considers the product of the number of mushrooms (`i`) and the minimum magic power among them (`v_sorted[i - 1]`).
- **Tracking Maximum Strength and Minimum Mushrooms**: The program correctly tracks the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve this strength.
- **Logic Flow**: The logic flow is correct and handles the problem constraints appropriately.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`. There is no explicit check for these conditions, which could lead to errors if these assumptions are not met.
  - The function also assumes that `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. While `p` is used to create `v_sorted`, the function does not validate that `p` is indeed a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
  - If `v` contains duplicate elements, the function still correctly identifies the maximum strength and corresponding index, as the sorting ensures that the highest value is considered first.

Upon careful analysis, the function `func_1` does not fully address the problem statement. Specifically, the function does not account for the fact that some mushrooms may have their magic power set to zero due to the permutation `p`. The function only considers the sorted order of `v` and does not incorporate the permutation `p` to determine which mushrooms' powers are effectively zeroed out.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify which mushrooms' magic powers will be zeroed out according to the permutation `p`.
- Calculate the strength considering only the non-zeroed-out mushrooms.

Given this, the original assessment is inaccurate because the provided code does not correctly handle the permutation `p` to determine the effective magic powers of the mushrooms.

Final: **False**
