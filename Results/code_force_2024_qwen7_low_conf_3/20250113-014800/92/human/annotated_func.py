    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_strength` is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range `[1, n]`, `min_mushrooms` is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `strength` is not relevant after the loop, `total` is not relevant after the loop, `i` is `n + 1` since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
    return max_strength, min_mushrooms
    #`The program returns max_strength which is the maximum value of i * v_sorted[i - 1] for i in the range [1, n]`, and min_mushrooms which is the smallest i such that i * v_sorted[i - 1] equals max_strength
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `v` (a list of positive integers of length `n`), and `p` (a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`). The function returns two values: `max_strength` (the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range `[1, n]`) and `min_mushrooms` (the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`). 

Here is a step-by-step summary of the function's actions:
1. The function first sorts the list `v` in descending order to get `v_sorted`.
2. It initializes `max_strength` to 0 and `min_mushrooms` to `n`.
3. It iterates through the range `[1, n]`:
   - For each `i`, it calculates the strength as `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`.
   - If the calculated strength is greater than `max_strength`, it updates `max_strength` to the new value and sets `min_mushrooms` to `i`.
   - If the calculated strength is equal to `max_strength`, it updates `min_mushrooms` to the smaller of its current value and `i`.
4. After the loop completes, it returns `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`. There is no explicit check for these conditions, which could lead to errors if these assumptions are not met.
- The function also assumes that `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. While `p` is used to create `v_sorted`, the function does not validate that `p` is indeed a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- If `v` contains duplicate elements, the function still correctly identifies the maximum strength and corresponding index, as the sorting ensures that the highest value is considered first.
