Postcondition: ***`strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `max_strength` is equal to `strength`, `min_mushrooms` is 1. If `strength` equals `max_strength`, the function does not change any variables.***
