Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `strength` equals `max_strength`, and `min_mushrooms` is 3.*** 

Explanation: Given the preconditions and the program fragment, if the condition `strength == max_strength` evaluates to true, then the postcondition is simply that `strength` equals `max_strength` while maintaining the other preconditions (`i` is 3 and `min_mushrooms` is 3). Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the condition is false, and we retain the original values of `i` and `min_mushrooms`.
