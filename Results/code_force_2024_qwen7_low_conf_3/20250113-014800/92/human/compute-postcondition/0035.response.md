Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\), `h` is a heap, `j` is \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), `output` is a tuple where the first element is the product of the length of the heap and the root of the heap, and the second element is the length of the heap. Specifically, if the heap initially has 1 element, then `output` is \((h[0], 1)\). If the heap has more than 1 element, the smallest element of the heap is updated to the second smallest element after the last push, and `output` is \((h[0] * l, l)\), where `l` is the new length of the heap, either due to pushing a new element or due to a reduction in the heap size.**
