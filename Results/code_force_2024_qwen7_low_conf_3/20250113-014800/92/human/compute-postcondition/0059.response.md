Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap with the smallest element possibly removed. `l` and `output` are updated as follows: if `len(h) == 1`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `h[0] >= output[0]`, `h` includes `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` and `l` is updated to `l - 1`. If `h[0] < output[0]`, the condition remains unchanged, and `l` remains `l` without any changes to `h`. In either case, if `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, `l` is decremented by 1 and `output` is set to `h[0] * (l - 1)`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged and `output` remains `h[0] * l`.***
