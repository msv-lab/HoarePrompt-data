Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `strength` equals `max_strength`, and `min_mushrooms` is 3. This is because if `strength` is greater than `max_strength`, the condition is not met and the else part is executed, setting `strength` to `max_strength` and keeping `min_mushrooms` as 3. If the condition is not met (i.e., `strength` is not greater than `max_strength`), the if part does not change `strength` and `min_mushrooms` remain as 3.***
