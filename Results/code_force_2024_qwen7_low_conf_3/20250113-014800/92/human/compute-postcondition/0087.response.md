`heapq.heappop(h)` pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. This operation modifies the heap `h` by removing its smallest element. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer input.
- `p` is a new list of integers from the input.
- `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\).
- `h` is a heap containing the values \(v[p[i] - 1]\) for \(i\) in range \((n + 2) // 2\).
- `j` is \(-1\).
- `output` is a tuple \((len(h) * h[0], len(h))\).
- `v` is a list of integers from the new input.
- If `n` is even, `h` contains its smallest element.

After `heapq.heappop(h)` is executed, the smallest element from `h` is removed. The updated state is:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer input.
- `p` is a new list of integers from the input.
- `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\).
- `h` is a heap containing the remaining elements after the smallest one has been popped.
- `j` is \(-1\).
- `output` is a tuple \((len(h) * h[0], len(h))\).
- `v` is a list of integers from the new input.
- If `n` is even, `h` now contains its second smallest element (since the smallest was just popped).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input, `p` is a new list of integers from the input, `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2, `h` is a heap containing the remaining elements after the smallest one has been popped, `j` is \(-1\), `output` is a tuple \((len(h) * h[0], len(h)), `v` is a list of integers from the new input, and if `n` is even, `h` now contains its second smallest element.**
