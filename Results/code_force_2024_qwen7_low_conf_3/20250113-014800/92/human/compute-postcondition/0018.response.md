Postcondition: ***`strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `max_strength` is updated to `strength` if `strength > max_strength`, otherwise `max_strength` remains unchanged, `min_mushrooms` is 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as per the if part.***
