The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `v`, and `p`. 

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`.
- `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

After executing the function body, the function returns two values:
- `max_strength`, which is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range `[1, n]`, where `v_sorted` is the sorted version of the list `v` based on the permutation `p`.
- `min_mushrooms`, which is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a list of positive integers `v`, and a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` `p`, and return the maximum strength and the index corresponding to this maximum strength in the sorted list.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `v`, and `p`. It returns `max_strength`, which is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range `[1, n]`, and `min_mushrooms`, which is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`, where `v_sorted` is the sorted version of the list `v` based on the permutation `p`.**
