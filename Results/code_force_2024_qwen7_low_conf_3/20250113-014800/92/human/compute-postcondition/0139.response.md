Postcondition: ***`h` is a min-heap containing elements from `v[p[i] - 1]` for `i` ranging from `n - 1` to `n - max_size`, excluding the smallest element. `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `v` retains its initial value. This holds whether `n` is even or odd.***
