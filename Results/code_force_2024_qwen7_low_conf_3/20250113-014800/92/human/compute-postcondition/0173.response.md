The `break` statement does not modify the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. The precondition remains intact.

Output State: **`h[0]` and `output` are elements/tuples. If `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, then `output` is a tuple with the first element as `h[0]` and the second element as `1`. There is no break operation that changes these values.**
