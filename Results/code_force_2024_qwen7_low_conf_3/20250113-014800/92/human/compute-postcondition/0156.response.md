Postcondition: ***`output` is `h[0] * l, l`, `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, `v` retains its initial value, `l` is the length of `h`, and if `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, the new minimum value in `h` is `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part.***
