The code `max_strength = strength` assigns the current value of `strength` to `max_strength`. The value of `strength` is initially `2 * v_sorted[1]`. Therefore, `max_strength` is now also `2 * v_sorted[1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `max_strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `min_mushrooms` is 1**
