Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap. If `len(h)` equals 1, then `output` is `(h[0], 1)` if `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`. Otherwise, `h` has one less element, and `l` is `n - 1`. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `h` contains the element `v[p[n - 1] - 1]` in addition to its previous elements, and `output` is updated to `h[0] * l`. Otherwise, the state of `h` remains unchanged, and `output` remains as its original value.***
