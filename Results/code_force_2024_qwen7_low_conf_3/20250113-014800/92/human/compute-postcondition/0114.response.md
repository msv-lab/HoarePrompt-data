The code `l = len(h)` calculates the length of the heap `h` and assigns it to the variable `l`. Since `h` is a heap with one less element than before, the length of `h` is now one less than its previous length. Let's denote the previous length of `h` as `n`. Therefore, the new length of `h` is `n-1`.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with one less element than before, and the smallest element has been removed; `l` is `n-1`**
