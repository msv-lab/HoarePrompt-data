Postcondition: **`strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `max_strength` is now equal to `strength`, `min_mushrooms` is a positive integer with the same value as `n`. The current value of `strength` is greater than `max_strength`**
