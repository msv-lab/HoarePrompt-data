The code initializes the variable `max_strength` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `v`, `p`, or `v_sorted`. Therefore, the only change is that `max_strength` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`; `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order; `max_strength` is 0**
