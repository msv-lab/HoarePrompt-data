`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since the heap `h` is modified by this operation, the size of the heap `h` is reduced by one. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`h` is the heap with one less element (the smallest element is removed), no changes to other variables**
