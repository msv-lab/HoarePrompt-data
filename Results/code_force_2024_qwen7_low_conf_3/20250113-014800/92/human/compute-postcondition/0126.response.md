`p` is assigned the values from the input split into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input `.split()` method reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string to an integer. Other variables remain unchanged.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n` or the contents of `v`, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `p`. However, we know that `p` is now a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with 1 or 0 elements, `output` is a tuple representing the smallest element in the heap and its count after the update, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `max_size`, `j`, and `v` retain their initial or updated values.**
