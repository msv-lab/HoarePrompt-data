According to the given for loop statement, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `max_size`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `max_size`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `h` now contains `v[p[n - 1] - 1]` (in addition to its previous contents)
- `j` is 0
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `max_size` remains unchanged
- `v` retains its initial value
- `p` remains unchanged

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `max_size`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `max_size` remains unchanged from the initial value, the loop will execute again because 0 is indeed less than any positive value of `max_size`.

After the first iteration of the loop, the value of `j` will increase by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` will be 1
- All other variables (`h`, `t`, `max_size`, `v`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

State: **`h` now contains `v[p[n - 1] - 1]` (in addition to its previous contents), `j` is 1, `t` is `t - 1`, `max_size` remains unchanged, `v` retains its initial value, and `p` remains unchanged**
