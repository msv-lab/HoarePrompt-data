Postcondition: ***`output` is either (`h[0]`, 1) or (`max_size - 1` * `smallest`, `max_size - 1`), `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `v` retains its initial value. The length of `h` is 1, and `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `max_size - 1 * smallest`. If `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `max_size - 1 * smallest`, then `output` is set to (`h[0]`, 1); otherwise, `output` remains as (`max_size - 1` * `smallest`, `max_size - 1`). If the length of `h` is greater than 1, `output` is set to (`h[0] * l, l`), where `l` is the length of `h`, and if `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, the new minimum value in `h` is `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`.***
