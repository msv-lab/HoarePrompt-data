Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\), `h` is a heap with its smallest element being the second smallest after the last push, `j` is \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), `output` is a tuple \((k * h[0], k)\), `l` is the length of the heap `h` reduced by 1, and either `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` is pushed onto the heap `h`, or the original state of the heap remains unchanged.***
