The `heapq.heappop(h)` function removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` is a heap and its length is greater than 1, after executing `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element in `h` is removed. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with one less element than before, and the smallest element has been removed.**
