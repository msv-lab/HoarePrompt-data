`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` is a heap and `l` is the length of `h` before the operation, which is `n-1`, after the operation, the new length of `h` will be `n-2`.

Output State: **`h` is the heap with one less element; `l` is `len(h)`, which is `n-2`; the smallest element from `h` before the pop operation is returned.**
