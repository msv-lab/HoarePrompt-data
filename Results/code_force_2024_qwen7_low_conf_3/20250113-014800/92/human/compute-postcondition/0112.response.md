The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or the most nested structure it is within. Since there is no loop or nested structure indicated in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program would exit the context where this `break` statement is placed.

Given the initial state where `h` is a heap with a length greater than 1, and `output` is defined as `(h[0], 1)` if `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, the `break` statement does not alter these conditions or the values of the variables involved.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with length greater than 1, `output` is `(h[0], 1)` if `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`.**
