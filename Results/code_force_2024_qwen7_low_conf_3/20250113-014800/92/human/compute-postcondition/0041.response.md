The code `l = len(h)` calculates the length of the heap `h` and assigns it to the variable `l`. After executing this line of code, the heap `h` remains unchanged from its initial state, except that the variable `l` now holds the length of `h`.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with the smallest element removed, the returned value is the smallest element previously in `h`; `l` is the length of `h`**
