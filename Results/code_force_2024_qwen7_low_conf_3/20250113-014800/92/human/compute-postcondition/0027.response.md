Output State: **`max_strength` is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range `[1, n]`, `min_mushrooms` is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `strength` is not relevant after the loop, `total` is not relevant after the loop, `i` is `n + 1` since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- For each iteration, it calculates `strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]`.
- It updates `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` based on the conditions provided.
- After all iterations, `max_strength` will be the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range `[1, n]`.
- `min_mushrooms` will be the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.
- Once the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n + 1`.
- Variables like `strength` and `total` are not relevant after the loop since they are only used within the loop to update other variables.
