Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while True` loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `output` is either (`h[0]`, 1) or (`max_size - 1` * `smallest`, `max_size - 1`)
- `j` is `max_size`
- `t` is `t - max_size`
- `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`
- `p` remains unchanged
- `v` retains its initial value
- Length of `h` is 1
- `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `max_size - 1 * smallest`

### Loop Condition
The loop is `while True`, meaning the loop will always execute unless explicitly stopped. However, we need to ensure that all relevant states are consistent with the conditions given in the problem.

### Analyzing the Loop Body
Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. Given the current state:

- `j` is already set to `max_size`, and the condition `j < max_size` would not be true. Therefore, `j` must remain `max_size` for the loop to continue.
- `t` is set to `t - max_size`, and we need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the remaining value of `t`.
- `max_size` remains constant.
- `p` and `v` remain unchanged.
- The length of `h` is 1, and `h[0]` is set to a specific value based on certain conditions.

Given that the loop is `while True`, no adjustments to the states are necessary because the loop will always continue unless there is an explicit exit condition that is not mentioned here.

### Conclusion
No adjustments to the states are needed for the `while True` loop to execute one more time since the loop will continue indefinitely as long as it is not explicitly exited.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`output` is either (`h[0]`, 1) or (`max_size - 1` * `smallest`, `max_size - 1`), `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, `v` retains its initial value, and the length of `h` is 1, with `h[0]` greater than or equal to `max_size - 1 * smallest`.**
