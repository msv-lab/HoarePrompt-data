Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap with the smallest element removed. If `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, the new element `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` is added to the heap, `l` is decremented by 1, and `output` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `h` remains a heap with the smallest element removed and `l` remains unchanged.***
