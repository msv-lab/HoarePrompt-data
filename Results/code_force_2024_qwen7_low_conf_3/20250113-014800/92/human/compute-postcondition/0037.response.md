The code `output = h[0], 1` tries to assign values to the variable `output`. However, since `h` is not defined in the initial state, this line of code will raise a NameError. Given that the problem states "None of the states need to be adjusted" and the loop will continue to execute indefinitely, it implies that no actual assignment can take place due to the undefined variable `h`.

Output State: **None of the states need to be adjusted**
