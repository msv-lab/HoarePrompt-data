Postcondition: ***`h` is a list and `output` is a tuple. If `len(h) == 1` and `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, then `output` is set to `h[0], 1`. If `len(h) == 1` and the condition is not met, `output` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `h` does not contain its smallest element and `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `output` is set to `h[0] * l, l`. If neither of these conditions is met, `output` remains unchanged.***
