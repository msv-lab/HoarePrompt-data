`strength` is assigned the value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`. Given that `i` will be 3 after the next iteration and assuming `v_sorted` is defined and accessible, the value of `strength` will be `3 * v_sorted[2]`. The precondition that `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue is also valid.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `strength` is 3 * `v_sorted[2]`, and for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.**
