The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. Instead, it implies that the function will process inputs through some internal mechanism or external calls (not shown in the given snippet). The parameters and their constraints are provided in the problem description rather than within the function itself.

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- `v` is a list of `n` positive integers where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\).
- `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the output cases not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, we infer the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes test cases defined by `t`, where for each test case, it takes `n`, a list `v` of length `n`, and a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n`. It returns a result based on these inputs.**
