`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` is a min-heap containing elements from `v[p[i] - 1]` for `i` ranging from `n - 1` to `n - max_size`, the smallest element is removed from the heap. The values of `j`, `t`, `max_size`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a min-heap containing elements from `v[p[i] - 1]` for `i` ranging from `n - 1` to `n - max_size` excluding the smallest element, `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `v` retains its initial value.**
