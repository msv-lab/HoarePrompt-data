Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`
   - `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`
   - `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order
   - `max_strength` is updated to `strength` if `strength > max_strength`, otherwise `max_strength` remains unchanged
   - `min_mushrooms` is 2 if there is an else part, otherwise `min_mushrooms` is 1

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over `range(1, n + 1)`, which means `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is currently 2, which means the loop has already executed for `i = 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - `strength` remains unchanged because it depends on the value of `v_sorted[1]`, which does not change within the loop body unless explicitly modified.
   - `total` remains 0 because no mushrooms have been added to the total yet.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `v` remains unchanged.
   - `p` remains unchanged.
   - `v_sorted` remains unchanged because it is sorted and does not change within the loop body.
   - `max_strength` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it.
   - `min_mushrooms` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes it.

5. **Final State:**
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `max_strength` is updated to `strength` if `strength > max_strength`, otherwise `max_strength` remains unchanged, `min_mushrooms` is 2 if there is an else part, otherwise `min_mushrooms` is 1.**
