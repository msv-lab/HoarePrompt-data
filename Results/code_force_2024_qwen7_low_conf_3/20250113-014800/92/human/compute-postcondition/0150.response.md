Postcondition: **`output` is (`max_size - 1` * `smallest`, `max_size - 1`), `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, `v` retains its initial value, `l` is the length of `h`, and the first element of `h` is less than the value at index `p[l - 1] - 1` in `v`**
