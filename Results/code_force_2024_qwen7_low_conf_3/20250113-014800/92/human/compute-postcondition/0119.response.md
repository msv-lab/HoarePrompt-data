Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap with one less element than before, and `l` is `n - 1`. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `h` now contains the element `v[p[n - 1] - 1]` in addition to its previous elements, and `output` is updated to `h[0] * l`. Otherwise, the state of `h` remains unchanged, and `output` remains as its original value.***
