The code `heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `h`, we assume that `h` is a valid heap. After executing `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element in `h` is removed, and its value is returned.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with the smallest element removed, the returned value is the smallest element previously in `h`.**
