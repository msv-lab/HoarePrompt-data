The code `heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since the initial state indicates that `h` is a heap with one less element than before, and the smallest element has been removed, this operation continues that process.

The variable `l` is initially set to `n-1`, which is consistent with the initial state. The operation `heapq.heappop(h)` does not affect the value of `l`, but it does remove the smallest element from `h`.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with one less element than before, and the smallest element has been removed; `l` is `n-1`; the smallest element of `h` is removed.**
