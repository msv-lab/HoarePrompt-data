The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` from its initial state to the integer input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\), `h` is a heap with exactly one element and the smallest element is `final_h[0]`, `j` is \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), `output` is a tuple \((final_h[0], 1)\), and `final_h[0]` and `1` are printed**
