The initial state is as follows:
- `strength` is `v_sorted[0]`
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer
- `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`
- `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`
- `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order
- `max_strength` is updated to `strength` if `strength > max_strength`, otherwise `max_strength` remains unchanged
- `min_mushrooms` is 1

The code snippet updates the value of `strength`:
```python
strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]
```

Here, `i` is 2, so the new value of `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers of length `n` sorted in descending order, `max_strength` is updated to `strength` if `strength > max_strength`, otherwise `max_strength` remains unchanged, `min_mushrooms` is 1**
