Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input, `p` is a new list of integers from the input, `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2, `h` is a heap containing the remaining elements after the smallest one has been popped, `j` is \(-1\), `output` is a tuple \((len(h) * h[0], len(h)), `v` is a list of integers from the new input, `l` is the length of the list `h`, and if `n` is even, `h` now contains its second smallest element. The current value of `h[0]` is less than the value of `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`***
