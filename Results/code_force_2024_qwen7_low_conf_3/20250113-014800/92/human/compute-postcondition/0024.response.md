The code `min_mushrooms = min(min_mushrooms, i)` is executed, which updates `min_mushrooms` to be the minimum value between its current value and `i`. Given that `i` is initially 3, and assuming `min_mushrooms` is not provided and is considered to start at infinity or a value larger than 3 (since no initial value is given and we need a starting point for comparison), `min_mushrooms` will be updated to 3.

The states of other variables (`i` and `strength`) remain unchanged because the code only affects `min_mushrooms`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `strength` is 3 * `v_sorted[2]`, `min_mushrooms` is 3**
