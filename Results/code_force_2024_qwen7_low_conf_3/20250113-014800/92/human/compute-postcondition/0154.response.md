Postcondition: **`output` is (`max_size - 1` * `smallest`, `max_size - 1`), `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, `v` retains its initial value, `l` is the length of `h`, `h[0] * l` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, and if `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, the new minimum value in `h` is `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`.**
