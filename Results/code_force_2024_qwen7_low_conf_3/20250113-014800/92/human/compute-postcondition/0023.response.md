The variable `min_mushrooms` is assigned the value of `i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 3, the value of `min_mushrooms` becomes 3. The values of `i` and `max_strength` remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to continue (`i` must be less than or equal to `n`) is not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `max_strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`, `min_mushrooms` is 3**
