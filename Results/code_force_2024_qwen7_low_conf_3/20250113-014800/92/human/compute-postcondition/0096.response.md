Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input, `p` is a new list of integers from the input, `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\), `h` is a heap, `j` is \(-1\), `output` is a tuple representing the smallest element in the heap and its count, `v` is a list of integers from the new input, and if `n` is even, `h` does not contain its smallest element. If the length of the heap `h` is 1, the output is updated to \((h[0], 1)\). Otherwise, the output is updated to \((h[0] * l, l)\) where `l` is the length of the list `h`, and the new smallest element in `h` is `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` if it's smaller than the previous smallest element, or the previous smallest element remains unchanged if `h[0] >= v[p[l - 1] - 1]`. The final `output` reflects the smallest element in the heap and its count after the update.**
