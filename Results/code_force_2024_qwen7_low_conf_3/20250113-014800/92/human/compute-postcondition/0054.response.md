`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` is initially a heap with the smallest element removed, removing another element means `h` now contains `l-1` elements. The value of `l` (the length of `h`) is reduced by 1. The `output` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with the smallest element removed, `l` is `l-1`, `output` remains unchanged**
