The code `max_strength = strength` assigns the value of `strength` to `max_strength`. Since `strength` is initially `3 * v_sorted[2]`, `max_strength` will also be `3 * v_sorted[2]`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`i` is 3, `max_strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`, and for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.**
