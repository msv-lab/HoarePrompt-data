`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` does not contain the smallest element initially, after this operation, `h` will no longer contain the smallest element it previously had, but it might now contain a new smallest element since the smallest element has been removed.

Output State: **`h` does not contain its previous smallest element; `l` is decremented by 1**
