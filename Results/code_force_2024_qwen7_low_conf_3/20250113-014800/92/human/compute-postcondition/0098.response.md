The code `output = h[0], 1` assigns the first element of the list `h` to the variable `output` and sets the second element of the tuple to `1`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `h`, we will consider the general case.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be:

- `output` is now a tuple consisting of the first element of `h` and `1`.
- The value of `h` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`output` is a tuple of `h[0]` and `1`, and `h` remains in its initial state.**
