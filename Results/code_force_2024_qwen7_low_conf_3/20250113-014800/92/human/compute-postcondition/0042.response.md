`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. This action affects the variable `h` by reducing its size and updating its content. The length of `h` (`l`) decreases by one because the smallest element has been removed. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `h` is a heap with the smallest element removed, and the returned value (let's denote it as `smallest`) is the smallest element previously in `h`.
- `l` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with the smallest element removed, `l` is `l - 1`, and `smallest` is the smallest element previously in `h`.**
