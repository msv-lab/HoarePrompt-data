Postcondition: ***The list `h` and the list `output` remain unchanged if the length of `h` is 1. Otherwise, `h` is a heap with the smallest element removed. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `h` now includes `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` and `l` is updated to `l - 1`. If `h[0] * l < output[0]`, the condition remains unchanged, and `l` remains `l` without any changes to `h`.***
