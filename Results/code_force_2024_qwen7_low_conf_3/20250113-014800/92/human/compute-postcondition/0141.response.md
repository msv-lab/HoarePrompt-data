According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the condition is true, which in this case is always true since it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the given states to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`output` is (`max_size - 1` * `smallest`, `max_size - 1`), `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `v` retains its initial value**
