Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input, `p` is a new list of integers from the input, `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\), `h` is a heap containing the values \(v[p[i] - 1]\) for \(i\) in range \((n + 2) // 2\), `j` is \(-1\), `output` is a tuple \((final_h[0], 1)\), `v` is a list of integers from the new input. The current value of `n` is even.***
