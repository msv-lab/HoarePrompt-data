`output` is assigned the tuple `(h[0], 1)`. The value of `h[0]` is taken from the heap `h`, and the second element of the tuple is `1`. The length of `h` must be greater than 1, which means there is at least one more element in `h` after `h[0]`. The value of `h` itself does not change, but now `output` holds the first element of `h` and the integer `1`. 

Output State: **`h` is a heap and len(`h`) must be greater than 1; `output` is (h[0], 1)**
