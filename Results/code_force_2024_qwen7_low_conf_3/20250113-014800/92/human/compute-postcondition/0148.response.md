`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `h`, only that `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, and `v` retains its initial value. Since the heap operation does not directly modify `output`, `j`, `t`, `max_size`, `p`, or `v`, and we do not know the exact content of `h`, the only thing that changes is the smallest element in `h`.

The output state will include the removal of the smallest element from `h`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`output` is (`max_size - 1` * `smallest`, `max_size - 1`), `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, `v` retains its initial value, and the smallest element from `h` has been removed.**
