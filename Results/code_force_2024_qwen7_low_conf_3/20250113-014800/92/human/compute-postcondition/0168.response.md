Postcondition: ***`output` is (0, 0), `j` is `max_size`, `t` is `t - max_size`, `max_size` remains `(n + 2) // 2`, `p` remains unchanged, `v` retains its initial value, `l` is 0. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then nothing specific changes. Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
