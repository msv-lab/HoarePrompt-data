Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer input, `p` is a new list of integers from the input, `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2, `h` is a heap` (either with the additional element `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` pushed into it if `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]` is true, or unchanged if `h[0] >= v[p[l - 1] - 1]`), `j` is \(-1\), `output` is a tuple \((len(h) * h[0], len(h)), `v` is a list of integers from the new input, `l` is the length of the list `h`, and the new smallest element in `h` is `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` if it's smaller than the previous smallest element, or the previous smallest element remains unchanged if `h[0] >= v[p[l - 1] - 1]`**.
