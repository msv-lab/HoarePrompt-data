Postcondition: **`h` is a heap with one less element than before, and the smallest element has been removed. If `h[0] < v[p[n - 1] - 1]`, then `h` now contains the element `v[p[n - 1] - 1]` in addition to its previous elements, and `l` is `n - 1`. If `h[0] >= v[p[n - 1] - 1]`, then the state of `h` remains unchanged, and `l` is `n - 1`.**
