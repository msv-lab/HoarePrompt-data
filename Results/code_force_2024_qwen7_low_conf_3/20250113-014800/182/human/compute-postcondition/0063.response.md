Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, and the character at index `i` in `a` is not '0'. If `b_count[1]` (the count of '1' in `b`) is non-zero, then `length` is 1. Otherwise, `length` remains 0.***
