Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, and `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]`. If the current character `a[i]` is '0', then if `b_count[0]` is true, `b_count[0]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is set to 1; otherwise, `length` remains 0. If `a[i]` is not '0', then if `b_count[1]` is non-zero, `length` is 1; otherwise, `length` remains 0.***
