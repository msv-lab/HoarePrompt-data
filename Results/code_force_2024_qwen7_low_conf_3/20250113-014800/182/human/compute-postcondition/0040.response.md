Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `b_count` is updated based on the count of '0' and '1' in `b`, specifically if `a[i]` is '0', `b_count[0]` is decremented by 1 and `b_count[1]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `b_count[1]` is decremented by 1, `length` is incremented by 1 if `b_count[0]` or `b_count[1]` (after decrement) is truthy, otherwise it remains 0, `i` is `i_start + 2`. If `b_count[1]` is truthy, `b_count[1]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `b_count` is updated according to the conditions described above and `length` remains unchanged.***
