Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State**: 
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `k` being 1 if `x == val` and 0 otherwise.
   - The list `a` is `[val, '*']`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the values generated by the function `I()`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to determine what changes need to be made for the loop to continue.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to continue, `x` (the current value from `I()`) must match `val` because `k` is set to 1 only when `x == val`.
   - If `x` does not match `val`, then `k` remains 0, and the loop would terminate.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the condition `x == val`, let's assume the next value from `I()` is indeed `val` (since the loop is continuing).
   - Therefore, `k` will be set to 1 after this iteration.
   - The list `a` will remain unchanged since no modifications are mentioned in the loop body.

5. **Final State After the Next Iteration**:
   - `k` will be 1 because `x` matches `val`.
   - `a` will remain `[val, '*']`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`k` is 1, `a` is `[val, '*']`**
