Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]`, `length` is either 0 or 1, the current value of `a[i]` is '0'. If `b_count[0]` is true, `b_count[0]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is set to 1. Otherwise, `length` remains 0 and `b_count[0]` remains unchanged.***
