Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The for loop is:
```python
for x in I():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the initial states:
- `val` is a positive integer
- `a` is 'I()*'
- `k` is 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop `for x in I():` suggests that `x` will take on values from the iterable `I()`.
   - For the loop to execute, `I()` must be an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, etc.) that can yield values.

2. **Current State**:
   - `val` is a positive integer: This doesn't directly affect the loop but is given as additional information.
   - `a` is 'I()*': This indicates that `a` is likely a string or some form of expression involving `I()`, but it doesn't provide direct information about the loop's execution.
   - `k` is 0: This might be related to some external variable, but it doesn't directly influence the loop's execution based on the given context.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `I()` produces at least one value.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `I()` must be a non-empty iterable.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `I()` must produce at least one value. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`I()` must be a non-empty iterable**
