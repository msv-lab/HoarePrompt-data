The initial state is: `k` is the number of elements `x` in the iterable returned by `I()` such that `x == a[k]` for each `x` encountered, `k` is printed; `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'.

The code snippet is:
```python
k = 0
```

This line sets the variable `k` to 0. The other variables (`a`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `k` is 0
- `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'

Output State: **`k` is 0, `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'**
