Postcondition: ***`i` is `k+1`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `b_count` is the count of '0's and '1's in `b`, and `length` is the length counter. If `b_count[1]` is true, then `b_count[1]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
