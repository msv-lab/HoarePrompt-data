The code `a = I() + '*'` impacts the program by assigning the value of `I()` concatenated with the string `'*'` to the variable `a`. The values of `I()`, `k`, `x`, and the printing of `k` are not affected. 

Therefore, the output state is: `I()` is called, `k` is the count of elements in `I()` for which `x == a[k]` is true, `x` is the next element in the iteration over `I()`, and `k` is printed; `a` is the result of concatenating the return value of `I()` with `'*'`.

Output State: **`I()` is called, `k` is the count of elements in `I()` for which `x == a[k]` is true, `x` is the next element in the iteration over `I()`, and `k` is printed; `a` is the result of concatenating the return value of `I()` with `'*'`**.
