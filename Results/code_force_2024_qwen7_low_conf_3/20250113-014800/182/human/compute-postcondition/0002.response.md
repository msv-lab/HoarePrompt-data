The function `I()` returns a positive integer. The value of `I()` is assigned to a variable, but since the actual return value is not specified, we denote it as `val`. The state of `I()` itself does not persist in the output as it is a function call. Therefore, the only affected variable is the one that receives the return value from `I()`. 

Output State: **`val` is a positive integer**
