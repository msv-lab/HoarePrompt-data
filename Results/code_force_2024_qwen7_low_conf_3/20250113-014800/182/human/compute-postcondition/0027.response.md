The code `a = I() + '*'` impacts the program by assigning the value returned by the function `I()` concatenated with a string `'*'` to the variable `a`. The variable `k` represents the number of elements in the iterable returned by `I()` such that each element is equal to `a[k]` for each encountered element. The value of `k` was previously printed, which means `k` holds a specific integer value. After executing the code, `k` remains unchanged, but `a` now contains the value returned by `I()` followed by `'*'`.

Output State: **`k` is the number of elements `x` in the iterable returned by `I()` such that `x == a[k]` for each `x` encountered, `k` is printed; `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'**
