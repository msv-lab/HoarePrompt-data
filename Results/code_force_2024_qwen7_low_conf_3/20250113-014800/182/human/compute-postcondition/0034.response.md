`k` is initially 2 and `a` is `[val, '*']`. The code updates `k` based on the condition `x == a[k]`.

1. The value of `a[k]` is `'*'` because `k` is 2 and the list `a` is `[val, '*', ...]`.
2. We need to evaluate the condition `x == a[k]`, which simplifies to `x == '*'`.
3. Since the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, let's denote it as `x_val`. So, we check if `x_val == '*'`.
4. If `x_val == '*'`, then `k` is updated by adding 1 to its current value (which is 2), making `k` equal to 3.
5. If `x_val != '*'`, then `k` remains unchanged at 2.

Since the value of `x` is not explicitly given, we will consider both cases:

- If `x_val == '*'`, then `k` becomes 3.
- If `x_val != '*'`, then `k` remains 2.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we will express the result in terms of the condition.

Output State: **`k` is 3 if `x_val == '*'` else 2, `a` is `[val, '*']`**
