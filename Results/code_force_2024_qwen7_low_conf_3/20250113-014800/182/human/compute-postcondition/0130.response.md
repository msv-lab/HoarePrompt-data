Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are the final input integers for the last test case, `a` is the final input string for the last test case, `b` is the final input string for the last test case, `b_count` is `[final_b.count('0'), final_b.count('1')]` where `final_b` is the string `b` after processing all test cases, and `length` is the total count of characters in `a` that satisfy the conditions across all test cases, printed.**
