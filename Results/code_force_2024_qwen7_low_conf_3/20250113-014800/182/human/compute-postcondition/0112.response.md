Postcondition: ***`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]`, and `length` is the value determined from the previous state. If `b_count[0]` is true, `b_count` is updated to `[b.count('0') - 1, b.count('1')]` and `length` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
