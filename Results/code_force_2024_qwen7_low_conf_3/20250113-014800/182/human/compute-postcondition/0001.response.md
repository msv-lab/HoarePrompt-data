Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs based on the value returned by `int(I())`.
   - `I()` is a function call, but we don't know its exact nature. For the loop to execute, `I()` must return a positive integer (since `int(I())` will be used as the number of iterations).

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop iterates `int(I())` times, `I()` must return a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - We already know from the initial state that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

3. **List the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - `I()` must return a positive integer.
   - The loop will iterate for each positive integer returned by `I()`.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

State: **`I()` must return a positive integer**
