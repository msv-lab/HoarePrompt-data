Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]`, and `length` is determined as follows:
- If the character at index `i` in `a` is '0' and `b_count[0]` is greater than 0, then `b_count[0]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, if the count of '1' in `b` is greater than 0, then `length` is 1.
- In all other cases, `length` remains 0.***
