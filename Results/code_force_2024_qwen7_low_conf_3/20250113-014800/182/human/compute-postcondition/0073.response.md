Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `b_count` is either `[b.count('0'), b_count[1] - 1]` if `b_count[1]` is true, otherwise `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]`, `length` is incremented by 1 if `b_count[1]` is true, `i` is `i + 1`, and the loop continues if `i + 1 < n`. If `b_count[1]` is false, the loop breaks out of the loop.***
