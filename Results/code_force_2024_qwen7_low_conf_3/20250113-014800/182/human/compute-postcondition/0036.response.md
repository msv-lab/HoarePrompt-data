The code `print(k)` prints the value of `k`. The value of `k` is determined by the length of the list generated by iterating over `I()` until `x != a[k]`. However, since the code only prints `k` and does not modify any variables, the value of `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is equal to the length of the list generated by iterating over `I()` until `x != a[k]`, `a` is the list `[val, '*', ...]` where the length is the same as `k` and ends with `'*'`**
