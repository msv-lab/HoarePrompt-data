Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `i` is `i + 2`. If `a[i]` is `'0'`, and if `b_count[0]` is true, then `length` is increased by 1 and `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is broken out. If `a[i]` is not `'0'`, then `length` is increased by 1 if `b_count[1]` is true, and `b_count[1]` is reduced by 1. If `b_count[1]` is false, the loop or if statement is broken out.***
