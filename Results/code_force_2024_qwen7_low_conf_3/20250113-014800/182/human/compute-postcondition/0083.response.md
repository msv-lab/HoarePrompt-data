Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `i` is `i + 2`, `length` is increased by 1 if `b_count[1]` is true, and `b_count[1]` is reduced by 1. If `b_count[1]` is false, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.***
