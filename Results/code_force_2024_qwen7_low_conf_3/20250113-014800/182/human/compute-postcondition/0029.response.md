Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is iterating over the result of `I()`. Therefore, the key variable here is `x`, which takes each value returned by `I()` during each iteration.

2. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `k` is 0
   - `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the expression `I()` must return at least one value. This is because the loop iterates over each value returned by `I()`.

4. **Adjusting States**: Since `x` takes values from `I()`, we need to ensure that `I()` returns at least one value. Additionally, since `a` is initialized as the value returned by `I()` followed by '*', we should keep this state as it is relevant to the initialization of `a`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `I()` must return at least one value (since the loop iterates over each value returned by `I()`).
- `a` remains as the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`k` is 0, `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*', `I()` must return at least one value**
