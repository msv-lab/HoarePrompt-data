`I` is assigned the value `input()`, which reads a line of input from the user. This operation affects the variable `I`, changing it from a function to the value read from the input. However, the original preconditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is a binary string of length n; b is a binary string of length m; the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `I` is the value read from the input**
