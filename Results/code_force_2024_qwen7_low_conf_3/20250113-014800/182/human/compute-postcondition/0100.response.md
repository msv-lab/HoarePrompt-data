Postcondition: ***`total` is not relevant here, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')], length` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, and `a[i]` is not equal to '0'***
