Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, and `i` is `i + 1` or `n`. Depending on whether `a[i]` is '0', `b_count` is either `[b.count('0') - 1, b.count('1')]` or `[b.count('0'), b.count('1') - 1]`, and `length` is incremented by 1 if `b_count[1]` is true. The loop continues if `i + 1 < n`.***
