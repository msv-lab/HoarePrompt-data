Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - The value of `k` depends on the conditions `x == a[0]` and `x == a[1]`.
     - If both conditions are true, `k` is set to 2.
     - If both conditions are false, `k` is set to 0.
     - Otherwise, `k` is set to 1.
   - The value of `x` is determined by the function `I()`, which we assume returns values one by one.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each value returned by the function `I()`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since the loop is about to execute again, `x` will be set to the next value returned by `I()`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `I()` returns a new value for `x`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `k` will be recalculated based on the new value of `x`.
   - The value of `x` will change to the next value from `I()`.
   - The conditions `x == a[0]` and `x == a[1]` will be re-evaluated to determine the new value of `k`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `x` (which will be the next value from `I()`) and the recalculated value of `k`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`k` is 2 if the next value of `x` equals `a[0]` and `a[1]`, 0 if the next value of `x` does not equal `a[0]` and `a[1]`, and 1 otherwise, and `x` is the next value returned by `I()`**
