Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string. If `b_count[1]` is truthy (i.e., `b_count[1]` is non-zero), then `b_count` is updated to `[b.count('0'), b_count[1] - 1]` and `length` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b_count` remains as `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]` and `length` keeps its previous value. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
