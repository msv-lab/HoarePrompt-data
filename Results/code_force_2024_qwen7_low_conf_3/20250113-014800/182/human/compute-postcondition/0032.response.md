In the initial state, `k` is 1 and `a` is `[val, '*']`. The code `k += x == a[k]` means that `k` is incremented by the boolean value resulting from the comparison between `x` (which is `a[1]` since `a` is `[val, '*']`) and `a[k]` (which is `a[1]` because `k` is 1).

Since `a[1]` is `'*'`, the condition `x == a[k]` simplifies to `'*' == '*'`, which evaluates to `True` (1 in integer form).

So, `k` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`k` is 2, `a` is `[val, '*']`**
