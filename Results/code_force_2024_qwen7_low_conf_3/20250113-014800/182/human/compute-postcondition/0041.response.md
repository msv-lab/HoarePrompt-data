Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `b_count` is updated based on the count of '0' and '1' in `b`. If `a[i]` is '0', `b_count[0]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is set to 1 if `b_count[0]` is truthy, otherwise `b_count[1]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is incremented by 1 if `b_count[0]` or `b_count[1]` (after decrement) is truthy, otherwise `length` remains 0. If `a[i]` is '1', `b_count[1]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is incremented by 1 if `b_count[1]` is truthy, otherwise `length` remains unchanged. `i` is `i_start + 2`.***
