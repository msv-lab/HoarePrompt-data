Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]`. If the count of '1' in `b` is greater than 0, then `length` is 1. Otherwise, `length` remains 0.***
