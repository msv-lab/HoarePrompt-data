Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]`, `length` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character at index `i` in `a` is '0' and `b_count[0]` is greater than 0, and the current value of `i` is less than `n`. If the character at index `i` in `a` is '0' and `b_count[0]` is greater than 0, `b_count[0]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is set to 1. Otherwise, `b_count` remains unchanged and `length` is set to 0.***
