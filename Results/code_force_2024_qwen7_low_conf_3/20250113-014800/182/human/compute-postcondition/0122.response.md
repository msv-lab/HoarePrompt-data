Postcondition: ***`i` is `k+1`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string. If `b_count[0]` is one less than the count of '0's and '1's in `b`, then `length` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b_count` remains the count of '0's and '1's in `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement we were directly inside.***
