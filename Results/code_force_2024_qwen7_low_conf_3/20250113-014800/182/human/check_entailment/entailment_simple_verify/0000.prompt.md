You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    I = input
    for _ in [0] * int(I()):
        I()
        a = I() + '*'
        k = 0
        for x in I():
            k += x == a[k]
        print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is a binary string of length n; b is a binary string of length m; the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    I = input
    for _ in [0] * int(I()):
        I()
        
        a = I() + '*'
        
        k = 0
        
        for x in I():
            k += x == a[k]
        
        print(k)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is the maximum index where `x == a[k]` holds true for all elements `x` in the iterable returned by `I()`, `a` is a list of length `k+1` ending with `'*'`, `I()` must return an iterable where the length is at least `k+1`, and `k` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the comparison between the prefixes of string `a` and string `b` properly. 

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. However, it reads the lengths of strings `a` and `b` and the strings themselves, but it does not actually check if a prefix of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

2. The line `a = I() + '*'` adds an extra character `'*'` to the end of the string `a`, which is unnecessary and does not affect the logic.

3. The loop `for x in I():` simply iterates through the characters of `b`, and `k += x == a[k]` increments `k` only if the current character of `b` matches the current character of `a`. This does not check if a prefix of `a` is a subsequence of `b` correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 4
  10011
  1110
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

In this case, the prefix "1" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
