### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The function `func` is designed to solve the given problem.
   - It takes input for the number of test cases (`t`), but does not handle `t` directly within the function. This suggests that the function should be called with an argument representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, followed by the strings themselves.
   - It uses a string `a + '*'` to ensure the loop does not go out of bounds when checking the characters of `a`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The variable `k` is initialized to 0. This variable is used to track the position in string `a` that needs to be matched.
   - For each character in string `b`, it checks if the current character matches the character at position `k` in string `a`.
   - If there's a match, it increments `k`. This effectively moves through string `a` as it finds matching characters in string `b`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The approach correctly handles the end of string `a` since `k` will stop increasing once it reaches the length of `a`.
   - The use of `a + '*'` ensures that the loop will terminate properly even if the last character of `a` is matched.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `k` for each test case, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification:
- The logic correctly implements the problem statement.
- The code handles all edge cases where the prefix of `a` might or might not be a subsequence of `b`.
- The approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n + m) per test case, which is feasible given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
