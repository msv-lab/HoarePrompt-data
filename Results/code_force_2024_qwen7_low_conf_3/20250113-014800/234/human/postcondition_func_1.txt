The function accepts an integer input provided by the user through the `input()` function and returns that integer. The function does not perform any additional operations on the input value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the integer input provided by the user. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does exactly what the annotations suggest.
