You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Initially, we had one array, which was a permutation of size n (an array of
size n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once).

We performed q operations. During the i -th operation, we did the following:

  * choose any array we have with at least 2 elements; 
  * split it into two non-empty arrays (prefix and suffix); 
  * write two integers l_i and r_i , where l_i is the maximum element in the left part which we get after the split, and r_i is the maximum element in the right part; 
  * remove the array we've chosen from the pool of arrays we can use, and add the two resulting parts into the pool. 

For example, suppose the initial array was [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] , and we
performed the following operations:

  1. choose the array [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] and split it into [6, 3] and [4, 1, 2, 5] . Then we write l_1 = 6 and r_1 = 5 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] and [4, 1, 2, 5] ; 
  2. choose the array [4, 1, 2, 5] and split it into [4, 1, 2] and [5] . Then we write l_2 = 4 and r_2 = 5 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] , [4, 1, 2] and [5] ; 
  3. choose the array [4, 1, 2] and split it into [4] and [1, 2] . Then we write l_3 = 4 and r_3 = 2 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] , [4] , [1, 2] and [5] . 

You are given two integers n and q , and two sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q]
and [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q] . A permutation of size n is called valid if we can
perform q operations and produce the given sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q]
and [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q] .

Calculate the number of valid permutations.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and q (1 \le q < n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains q integers l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q (1 \le l_i \le n ).

The third line contains q integers r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q (1 \le r_i \le n ).

Additional constraint on the input: there exists at least one permutation
which can produce the given sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q] and [r_1, r_2,
\dots, r_q] .

Output

Print one integer — the number of valid permutations, taken modulo 998244353 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. l is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ li ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q. r is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ ri ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of q integers, each integer between 1 and n inclusive, obtained from user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads `q` integers from user input and returns them as a list. Each integer in the returned list is guaranteed to be between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function assumes that the input is provided in the format of `q` space-separated integers. If the input does not conform to this format, the `map` function will raise a `ValueError`. There are no additional error handling mechanisms included in the provided code to manage such cases.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i, r_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input provided by the user through the `input()` function and returns that integer. The function does not perform any additional operations on the input value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the integer input provided by the user. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does exactly what the annotations suggest.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and l and r are lists of integers where each l_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ n, and each r_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object of integers split from input, where the input is a sequence of space-separated integers that represent values for `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` based on the given constraints
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a sequence of space-separated integers from the standard input, expecting the integers to represent values for `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` based on the given constraints (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and each element in `l` and `r` is between 1 and n). It then returns a map object containing these integers. There are no specific actions performed by the function other than reading the input and splitting it into integers. This means the function assumes the input format is correct and does not handle any errors related to incorrect input format or invalid values.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, l is a list of q integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ n, and r is a list of q integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns a string input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters as described in the annotations and the provided code only contains a single return statement that reads a string input from the user, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and returns it. There is no processing of `n`, `q`, `l`, or `r` as mentioned in the annotations. The function accepts user input, which must be provided through standard input, and returns the input as a string with any extra spaces removed. If no input is provided or the input is not a string, the function will still attempt to strip the whitespace, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if non-string data types are passed.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, l is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q, and r is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q.

    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the final value of `ans` after all multiplications and modulo operations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of nodes), `q` (the number of operations), `l` (a list of left indices), and `r` (a list of right indices). It constructs a doubly linked list based on these indices and then performs a series of operations to compute a final value `ans`.

The function first initializes a doubly linked list using the indices from lists `l` and `r`. Each node in the list is a `ListNode` object containing values from 1 to `n`. The function then traverses the list to create a sequence `a` of unique node values starting from the smallest index and moving through both directions until no more nodes can be visited.

Next, it constructs a segment array `seg` by counting the occurrences of transitions between consecutive values in `a`. Specifically, for each pair of consecutive values in `a`, it increments the count at the maximum value of the pair.

Finally, the function iterates backward through the segment array `seg` to compute the value of `ans` by multiplying counts of segments and applying modulo operation. The function returns the final value of `ans`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes that `l` and `r` are valid lists of indices within the range [1, n]. If `l` or `r` contain invalid indices, the function would raise an error.
2. The function does not handle the case where `l[i] == r[i]` for any `i`, which could lead to incorrect segmentation.
3. The function does not validate the initial values of `n` and `q` beyond checking their bounds.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program seems to attempt to simulate the described operations using a linked list approach, but there are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Linking Nodes**: The logic for linking nodes in the linked list is flawed. Specifically, the way nodes are linked and split does not align with the problem description. For instance, when splitting an array and assigning `l_i` and `r_i`, the program should ensure that the maximum elements in the left and right parts are correctly identified and linked.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Node Links**: The program tries to link nodes using `le` (left) and `ri` (right) pointers, but it does not handle the linking correctly. The logic for updating these pointers is incomplete and incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Permutations**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid permutations based on the linked list structure, but the logic for counting permutations is flawed. It does not correctly account for all possible ways to split the array while maintaining the constraints.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the described operations and cannot be relied upon to produce the correct number of valid permutations for the given sequences `[l_1, l_2, ..., l_q]` and `[r_1, r_2, ..., r_q]`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
