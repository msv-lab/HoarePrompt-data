Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of valid permutations based on a series of operations involving splitting arrays and recording maximum elements from splits. The provided solution involves constructing a doubly linked list based on the given operations and then performing calculations to determine the number of valid permutations.

Let's analyze the key steps of the function `func_5`:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a doubly linked list (`nodes`) and reads `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` from the input using `func_3`, `func_1`, and `func_1` respectively. This setup ensures that the linked list is constructed according to the operations specified in `l` and `r`.

2. **Building the Doubly Linked List**: The function constructs the linked list by linking nodes based on the values in `l` and `r`. For each operation, it links the appropriate nodes to form the new subarrays and updates the pointers accordingly.

3. **Traversing the Linked List**: After constructing the linked list, the function traverses it to form a sequence `a` of unique node values, starting from the smallest index and moving through both directions.

4. **Segment Array Calculation**: The function constructs a segment array `seg` to count the occurrences of transitions between consecutive values in `a`. This step is crucial for understanding the structure of the permutations formed during the operations.

5. **Final Calculation**: The function calculates the number of valid permutations by iterating backward through the segment array `seg` and computing the product of counts of segments, applying modulo `m` (998244353).

The function correctly handles the construction of the linked list and the subsequent calculations necessary to determine the number of valid permutations. The provided execution summaries indicate that the function behaves as expected, given the constraints and examples.

Considering the detailed analysis and the correctness of the logic implemented in `func_5`, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
