You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Initially, we had one array, which was a permutation of size n (an array of
size n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once).

We performed q operations. During the i -th operation, we did the following:

  * choose any array we have with at least 2 elements; 
  * split it into two non-empty arrays (prefix and suffix); 
  * write two integers l_i and r_i , where l_i is the maximum element in the left part which we get after the split, and r_i is the maximum element in the right part; 
  * remove the array we've chosen from the pool of arrays we can use, and add the two resulting parts into the pool. 

For example, suppose the initial array was [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] , and we
performed the following operations:

  1. choose the array [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] and split it into [6, 3] and [4, 1, 2, 5] . Then we write l_1 = 6 and r_1 = 5 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] and [4, 1, 2, 5] ; 
  2. choose the array [4, 1, 2, 5] and split it into [4, 1, 2] and [5] . Then we write l_2 = 4 and r_2 = 5 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] , [4, 1, 2] and [5] ; 
  3. choose the array [4, 1, 2] and split it into [4] and [1, 2] . Then we write l_3 = 4 and r_3 = 2 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] , [4] , [1, 2] and [5] . 

You are given two integers n and q , and two sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q]
and [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q] . A permutation of size n is called valid if we can
perform q operations and produce the given sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q]
and [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q] .

Calculate the number of valid permutations.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and q (1 \le q < n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains q integers l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q (1 \le l_i \le n ).

The third line contains q integers r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q (1 \le r_i \le n ).

Additional constraint on the input: there exists at least one permutation
which can produce the given sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q] and [r_1, r_2,
\dots, r_q] .

Output

Print one integer — the number of valid permutations, taken modulo 998244353 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of nodes), `q` (the number of operations), `l` (a list of left indices), and `r` (a list of right indices). It constructs a doubly linked list based on these indices and then performs a series of operations to compute a final value `ans`.

The function first initializes a doubly linked list using the indices from lists `l` and `r`. Each node in the list is a `ListNode` object containing values from 1 to `n`. The function then traverses the list to create a sequence `a` of unique node values starting from the smallest index and moving through both directions until no more nodes can be visited.

Next, it constructs a segment array `seg` by counting the occurrences of transitions between consecutive values in `a`. Specifically, for each pair of consecutive values in `a`, it increments the count at the maximum value of the pair.

Finally, the function iterates backward through the segment array `seg` to compute the value of `ans` by multiplying counts of segments and applying modulo operation. The function returns the final value of `ans`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes that `l` and `r` are valid lists of indices within the range [1, n]. If `l` or `r` contain invalid indices, the function would raise an error.
2. The function does not handle the case where `l[i] == r[i]` for any `i`, which could lead to incorrect segmentation.
3. The function does not validate the initial values of `n` and `q` beyond checking their bounds.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program seems to attempt to simulate the described operations using a linked list approach, but there are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Linking Nodes**: The logic for linking nodes in the linked list is flawed. Specifically, the way nodes are linked and split does not align with the problem description. For instance, when splitting an array and assigning `l_i` and `r_i`, the program should ensure that the maximum elements in the left and right parts are correctly identified and linked.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Node Links**: The program tries to link nodes using `le` (left) and `ri` (right) pointers, but it does not handle the linking correctly. The logic for updating these pointers is incomplete and incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Permutations**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid permutations based on the linked list structure, but the logic for counting permutations is flawed. It does not correctly account for all possible ways to split the array while maintaining the constraints.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the described operations and cannot be relied upon to produce the correct number of valid permutations for the given sequences `[l_1, l_2, ..., l_q]` and `[r_1, r_2, ..., r_q]`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
