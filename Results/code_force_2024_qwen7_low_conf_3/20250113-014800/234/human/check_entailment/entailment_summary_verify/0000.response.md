### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Functionality Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_5` correctly reads the inputs `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` from the standard input. This part is correct.

2. **Node Construction and Linking:**
   - The function constructs a doubly linked list (`ListNode`) based on the given indices. The nodes are correctly linked in such a way that they represent the split operations described in the problem statement. However, the original assessment pointed out potential issues with the linking logic. Let's review the relevant parts:
     ```python
     for i in range(q):
         (le, ri) = (nodes[l[i]], nodes[r[i]])
         if le:
             lri = le.ri
             ri = nodes[r[i]] = ListNode(r[i])
             if lri:
                 le.ri = lri.le = ri
                 (ri.le, ri.ri) = (le, lri)
             else:
                 (le.ri, ri.le) = (ri, le)
         elif ri:
             rle = ri.le
             le = nodes[l[i]] = ListNode(l[i])
             if rle:
                 rle.ri = ri.le = le
                 (le.le, le.ri) = (rle, ri)
             else:
                 (le.ri, ri.le) = (ri, le)
         else:
             nodes[l[i]] = ListNode(l[i])
             nodes[r[i]] = ListNode(r[i])
             (nodes[l[i]].ri, nodes[r[i]].le) = (nodes[r[i]], nodes[l[i]])
     ```
   - This code correctly handles the linking of nodes and ensures that the maximum elements in the left and right parts are correctly identified and linked.

3. **Sequence Generation and Segmentation:**
   - The sequence `a` is generated correctly by traversing the linked list and visiting all nodes.
   - The segment array `seg` is constructed to count the transitions between consecutive values in `a`. This step is also correct.

4. **Permutation Counting:**
   - The final part of the function calculates the number of valid permutations by iterating backward through the segment array and computing the product of counts, taking the modulo 998244353.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `l[i] == r[i]` as it would raise an error in this scenario, which is valid since the problem statement guarantees the existence of at least one valid permutation.

2. **Validation and Modulo Operation:**
   - The function correctly applies the modulo operation, ensuring that the result fits within the required bounds.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the function `func_5` correctly implements the required logic to generate valid permutations and count them. The original assessment highlighted potential issues with the linking logic, but the code provided in the function summary demonstrates that these issues do not exist. The function correctly handles all the necessary steps and does not introduce any logical errors.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
