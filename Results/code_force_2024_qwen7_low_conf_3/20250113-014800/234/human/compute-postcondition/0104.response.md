Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given Information:
- `i` is `v_value`.
- `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`.
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `v_value`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while nodes[i].ri:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `v_value`.
   - `nodes[i]` exists in the list, and we know that `nodes[i].ri` was `True` at the end of the previous iteration, which caused the loop to terminate.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition under which the loop would continue:

3. **Condition for Continuing the Loop**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[i].ri` must be `True` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `nodes[i].ri` was `False` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `nodes[i].ri` must become `True` in the next iteration.

Given that the only variable directly influencing the loop condition is `nodes[i].ri`, and since no information suggests any change in `i` or other variables that could affect `nodes[i].ri` (like `i` being incremented), we must ensure that `nodes[i].ri` is set to `True` for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` remains `v_value`.
- `nodes[i].ri` must be `True` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `v_value`, `nodes[i].ri` must be `True`**
