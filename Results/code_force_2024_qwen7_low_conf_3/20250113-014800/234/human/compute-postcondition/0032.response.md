The code `lri = le.ri` assigns the value of `le.ri` to the variable `lri`. Since `le` is `nodes[l[1]]` and `ri` is `nodes[r[1]]`, the value of `lri` is `nodes[l[1]].ri`. The values of `i`, `q`, `le`, and `ri` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `le` is nodes[l[1]], `ri` is nodes[r[1]], `lri` is nodes[l[1]].ri**
