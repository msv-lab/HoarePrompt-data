To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Conditions:
- `i` is `nodes[i].le.v`
- `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`
- `a` contains the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken
- `nodes[i]` is not `None`
- `nodes[i].le` must remain `True`

### Loop Statement:
```
while nodes[i].le:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `nodes[i].le` is `True`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is set to `nodes[i].le.v`
   - `nodes[i].le` is `True`
   - `nodes[i]` is not `None`

Since `nodes[i].le` is `True` and `nodes[i]` is not `None`, the condition for the loop to continue is already satisfied. There is no additional state change required to ensure that the loop can execute one more time because the loop will continue as long as `nodes[i].le` remains `True`.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are necessary in the given states for the loop to execute one more time. The condition for the loop to continue is already met based on the current state.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `nodes[i].le.v`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken, `nodes[i]` is not `None`, and `nodes[i].le` must remain `True`.**
