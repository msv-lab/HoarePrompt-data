Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `nodes[i].le` is `False`
   - `nodes[i].ri` must be `True`
   - `i` is `True`
   - `a` is `[True, True]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while nodes[i].ri:`

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `nodes[i].ri` must evaluate to `True`.

4. **Current State:**
   - According to the provided states, `nodes[i].ri` must be `True`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `nodes[i].ri` must already be `True` for the loop to continue, no adjustment is necessary to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the states do not need to be modified further.

**Answer:**
State: **`nodes[i].le` is `False`, `nodes[i].ri` must be `True`, `i` is `True`, `a` is `[True, True]`**
