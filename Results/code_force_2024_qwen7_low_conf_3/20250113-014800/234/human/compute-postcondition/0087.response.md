The code `i = nodes[i].ri.v` updates the value of `i` to be the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`. The initial state tells us that `i` was previously the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`, but now it will be updated to this new value. Other variables such as `q`, `nodes`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing the values `[i, i, i]`**
