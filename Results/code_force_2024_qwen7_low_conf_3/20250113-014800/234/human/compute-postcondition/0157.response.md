The code `ans *= cnt` multiplies the current value of `ans` by `cnt`. Since the initial value of `cnt` is not specified in the preconditions, let's denote the initial value of `cnt` as `cnt_initial`.

Therefore, after executing the line `ans *= cnt`, the new value of `ans` will be `ans_initial * cnt_initial`.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `n` is at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and at most `n`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values, `seg` is a list of length `n + 1`, `ans` is `ans_initial * cnt_initial`, `cnt` is unchanged**
