Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `le` is `nodes[l[2]]`, `ri` is a `ListNode` with value `r[2]`, `lri` is `nodes[l[2]].ri`, `le.ri` is `ri`, `ri.le` is `ri`.***

In this case, the overall postcondition is derived directly from the fact that the if condition is simply a boolean check (i.e., `lri` being true or false) but does not alter the values of the variables. Therefore, regardless of whether the if condition is true or false, the variables `i`, `q`, `le`, `ri`, and `lri` remain in their original states, and the attributes `le.ri` and `ri.le` are swapped as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part that changes these values further, the postcondition remains as described above.
