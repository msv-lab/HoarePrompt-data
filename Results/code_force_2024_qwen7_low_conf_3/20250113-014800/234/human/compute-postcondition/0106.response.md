`a` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `nodes[i].ri` is `True` and `i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `i` must be a value such that `nodes[i].ri.v` holds the same value as `i`. The value of `nodes[i].ri` remains `True`. The list `a` is now initialized with the value of `i`.

Output State: **`nodes[i].ri` is `True`, `i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `a` contains `i`**
