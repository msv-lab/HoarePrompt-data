Output State: **`nodes[i].ri` is `False`, `i` is the final node reached in the traversal, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `i`.**
