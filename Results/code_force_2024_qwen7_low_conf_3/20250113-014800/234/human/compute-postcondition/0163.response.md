`ans` is multiplied by `cnt`. The previous value of `ans` is `ans_initial % m` if `nodes[i]` is False, otherwise it is `ans_initial % m` plus `seg[i]`. The value of `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus `seg[i]` if `nodes[i]` is True, otherwise it is 1.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is the previous value of `ans` (which is `ans_initial % m` if `nodes[i]` is False, otherwise `ans_initial % m` plus `seg[i]`) multiplied by `cnt`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and at most `n`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values, `seg` is a list of length `n + 1`, `ans` is (`ans_initial % m` if `nodes[i]` is False, otherwise `ans_initial % m` plus `seg[i]`) times `cnt`, `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus `seg[i]` if `nodes[i]` is True, otherwise 1**
