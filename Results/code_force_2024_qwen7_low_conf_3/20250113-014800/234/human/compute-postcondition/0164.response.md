The code `ans %= m` performs the modulo operation on `ans` using `m`. This means `ans` is updated to be the remainder when divided by `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and at most `n`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values, `seg` is a list of length `n + 1`, `ans` is (`ans_initial % m` if `nodes[i]` is False, otherwise `ans_initial % m` plus `seg[i]`) times `cnt`, `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus `seg[i]` if `nodes[i]` is True, otherwise 1, and `ans` is updated to be `ans % m`.**
