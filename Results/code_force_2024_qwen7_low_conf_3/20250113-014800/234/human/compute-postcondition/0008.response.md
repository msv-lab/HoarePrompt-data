Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `le` is assigned the value of `nodes[l[0]]`, `ri` is a new `ListNode` with the value `r[i]`, `lri` is assigned the value of `nodes[l[0]].ri`, and `lri` is True***

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and incorporates the condition of the if statement, ensuring that `lri` is True after the if condition is met.
