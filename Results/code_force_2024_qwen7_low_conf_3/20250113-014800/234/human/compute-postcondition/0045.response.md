`nodes[r[i]]` is assigned the value `ListNode(r[i])`. The value of `r[i]` replaces the value of `nodes[r[i]]`, which was previously `ri`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `le` is `nodes[l[1]]`, `ri` is replaced by `ListNode(r[i])`, `nodes[l[1]]` is `ListNode(l[1])`**
