Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0. If `nodes[l[1]].ri` is `ListNode(r[i])`, then `le.ri` is `ListNode(r[i])`, `ri.le` is `ListNode(r[i])`, and `ri.ri` is `nodes[l[1]].ri`. If `ri` is true, then `le.ri` points to `le` and `ri.le` points to `ri`. Otherwise, `le` is `ListNode(l[1])`, `le.le` is `ri.le`, `le.ri` is `ri`, and `ri.le` is `le`. Additionally, `nodes[l[i]]` is `nodes[r[i]]` and `ri` is `ListNode(r[i])`***.
