The function `func_5` accepts four parameters: `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`. Here, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \le q < n \le 3 \times 10^5\), `l` is a list of `q` integers where \(1 \le l[i] \le n\) for all \(1 \le i \le q\), and `r` is a list of `q` integers where \(1 \le r[i] \le n\) for all \(1 \le i \le q\). After executing the function body, the function returns `ans`, which is the final value of `ans` after all multiplications and modulo operations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to accept parameters `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`, perform a series of multiplication and modulo operations, and return the final value of `ans`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`, performs multiplication and modulo operations, and returns the final value of `ans`.**
