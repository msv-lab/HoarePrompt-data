The code `lri = le.ri` assigns the value of `le.ri` to `lri`. Given the initial state where `le` is assigned the value of `nodes[l[0]]`, the expression `le.ri` refers to the `ri` attribute of `nodes[l[0]]`. Since `le` is `nodes[l[0]]`, `le.ri` is equivalent to `nodes[l[0]].ri`.

Therefore, after executing the line `lri = le.ri`, the value of `lri` is `nodes[l[0]].ri`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `le` is assigned the value of `nodes[l[0]]`, `ri` is assigned the value of `nodes[r[0]]`, and `lri` is assigned the value of `nodes[l[0]].ri`**
