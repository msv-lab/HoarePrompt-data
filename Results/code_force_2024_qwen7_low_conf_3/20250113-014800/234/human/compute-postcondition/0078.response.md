Output State: **`i` is the value of the last non-`None` node's `.le.v` attribute, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, `nodes[i]` is either `None` or a `ListNode` with value between `1` and `n`, and for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, if `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `nodes[i].ri` and `nodes[i].le` are either `None` or point to other `ListNode` objects within the list; `a` is an empty list; `nodes[i]` is not `None` and `nodes[i].le` is not `None`**
