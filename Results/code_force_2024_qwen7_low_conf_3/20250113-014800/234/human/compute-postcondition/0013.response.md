Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `le` is assigned the value of `nodes[l[0]]`, `ri` is a `ListNode` with the value `r[i]` and `lri` is a boolean indicating whether `lri` (originally `nodes[l[0]].ri`) was `True`. If `lri` is `True`, then `ri.le` is `le` and `ri.ri` is `lri`; otherwise, `lri` is `False`, `le.ri` is `ri`, and `ri.le` is `le`.***
