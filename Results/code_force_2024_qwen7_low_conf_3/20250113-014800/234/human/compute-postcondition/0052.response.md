The code `ri = nodes[r[i]] = ListNode(r[i])` updates the value of `ri`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `r[i]` is evaluated. Since `i` is initially 2, `r[i]` is equivalent to `r[2]`.
2. `nodes[r[2]]` is accessed, which is given by the initial state as `ri`.
3. A new `ListNode` object is created with the value `r[2]`, and this new object is assigned to both `ri` and `nodes[r[2]]`.

The previous values of `i`, `q`, `le`, and `lri` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `le` is `nodes[l[2]]`, `ri` is a ListNode with value `r[2]`, `lri` is `nodes[l[2]].ri`**
