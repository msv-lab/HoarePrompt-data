The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `n` is at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and at most `n`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values, `seg` is a list of length `n + 1`, `ans` is `ans_initial % m`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.**
