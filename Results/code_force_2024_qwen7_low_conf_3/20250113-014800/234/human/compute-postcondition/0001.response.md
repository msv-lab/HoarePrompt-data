The code `l, r = func_1(), func_1()` assigns the return values of `func_1()` to `l` and `r`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1()` is not specified, we assume it returns two lists of integers. Given the initial state where `l` and `r` are lists of integers generated by `func_3()`, the new values of `l` and `r` will be determined by `func_1()`.

Since the exact content of the lists returned by `func_1()` is not specified, we can only state that `l` and `r` are now lists of integers, and the values within these lists are unspecified. However, based on the initial conditions, the values within these lists should still satisfy \(1 \leq l[i] \leq n\) and \(1 \leq r[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\).

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq l[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\), `r` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq r[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\), `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_3()`**.
