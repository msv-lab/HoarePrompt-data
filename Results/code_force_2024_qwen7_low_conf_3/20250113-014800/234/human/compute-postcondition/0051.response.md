`lri` is assigned the value of `le.ri`. The value of `le.ri` is directly taken from the current state, where `le` is `nodes[l[2]]` and `ri` is `nodes[r[2]]`. Therefore, the value of `lri` is the same as `nodes[l[2]].ri`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `le` is `nodes[l[2]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[2]]`, and `lri` is `nodes[l[2]].ri`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `le` is `nodes[l[2]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[2]]`, `lri` is `nodes[l[2]].ri`**
