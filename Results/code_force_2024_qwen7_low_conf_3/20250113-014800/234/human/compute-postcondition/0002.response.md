The code initializes a list `nodes` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `None`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and the values of `n` and `q` are also unchanged because they are not directly used in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq l[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\), `r` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq r[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\), `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `None`.**
