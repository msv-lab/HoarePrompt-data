The code appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. The value of `i` is `v_value`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `v_value`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `v_value`**
