Output State: **`i` is the final node reached in the traversal, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken, and `nodes[i]` is not `None`, and `nodes[i].le` must remain `True`.**
