Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0. If `le` is `True`, then `ri` is a `ListNode` with the value `r[i]` and `ri.le` is `le`. If `lri` (originally `nodes[l[0]].ri`) is `True`, then `ri.ri` is `lri`; otherwise, `ri.ri` is `False`. If `le` is `False`, then `ri` is `False`. If `ri` is `True`, then `ri.le` is `l[0]` and `ri.ri` is `l[0]`. Otherwise, `nodes[l[i]]` is a `ListNode` with the value `l[i]` and `nodes[l[i]].ri` points to a `ListNode` with the value `r[i]`, `nodes[r[i]]` is a `ListNode` with the value `r[i]`, and `nodes[r[i]].le` points to a `ListNode` with the value `l[i]`.***
