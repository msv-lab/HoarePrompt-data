Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and at most `n`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values, `seg` is a list of length `n + 1`, `ans` is updated to either `ans_initial % m` plus `seg[i]` if `nodes[i]` is True, or `ans_initial % m` plus `seg[i]` times `cnt` if `nodes[i]` is False, and `cnt` is updated to either `cnt_initial + 1` if `nodes[i]` is True, or `2` if `nodes[i]` is False. Additionally, `ans` is ensured to be within the modulo `m`.***
