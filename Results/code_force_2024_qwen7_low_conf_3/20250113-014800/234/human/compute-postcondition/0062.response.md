Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `le` is `ListNode(l[2])`, `ri` is `nodes[r[2]]`, `rle` is `ri.le`, `le.ri` is `ri`, and `ri.le` is `le`. If `rle` is true, `le.le` is updated to `rle` and `le.ri` is updated to `ri`. If `rle` is false, `le.ri` is updated to `ri` and `ri.le` is updated to `le`.**
