Postcondition: ***`i` is the last value of `nodes[i].ri.v` before the loop was broken, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken, and `nodes[i]` is not `None`. Additionally, if `nodes[i]` is `None` or the loop terminates, `nodes[i]` remains unchanged and `a` contains the traversal sequence as described.***
