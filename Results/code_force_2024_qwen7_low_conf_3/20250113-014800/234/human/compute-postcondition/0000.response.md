The code `n, q = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()`, which returns two values, `n` and `q`. The initial states of `n` and `q` are defined as positive integers such that \(1 \leq q < n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), and `l` is a list of `q` integers where \(1 \leq l[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\), and `r` is a list of `q` integers where \(1 \leq r[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\). After calling `func_3()`, the values of `n` and `q` are updated by the function's return values. However, since the exact return values of `func_3()` are not specified, we can only say that `n` and `q` are now the values returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`l` is a list of `q` integers where \(1 \leq l[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\), `r` is a list of `q` integers where \(1 \leq r[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\), `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
