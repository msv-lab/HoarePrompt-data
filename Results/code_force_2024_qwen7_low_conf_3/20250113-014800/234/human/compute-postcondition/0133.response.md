Postcondition: ***`i` is the final node reached in the traversal plus 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken, and if `nodes[i].le` is `False` and `nodes[i].ri` is `True`, `a` contains only `True` values with length equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nodes[i]` is `False`, the same conditions hold but `a` may contain other values as well.***
