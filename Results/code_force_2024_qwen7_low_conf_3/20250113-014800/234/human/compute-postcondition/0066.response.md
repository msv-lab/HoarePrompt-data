Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0. `le` and `ri` are `ListNode` objects. If `ri.le` (denoted as `rle`) is true, `le.le` is updated to `rle` and `le.ri` is updated to `ri`. Otherwise, `le.ri` is updated to `ri` and `ri.le` is updated to `le`. In the else case, `le.ri` is updated to `ri` and `ri.le` is updated to `le`.***
