To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is `q`, and `q` is a non-negative integer such that `q <= n + 1`.
   - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - For all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, `nodes[i]` is either `None` or a `ListNode` with value between `1` and `n`.
   - For all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, if `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `nodes[i].ri` and `nodes[i].le` are either `None` or point to other `ListNode` objects within the list.
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `nodes[i]` is not `None`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `nodes[i].le`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `nodes[i]` is not `None`, we know there is a `ListNode` at index `i` in the `nodes` list.
   - To satisfy the loop condition `nodes[i].le`, the `le` attribute of `nodes[i]` must not be `None`. This means `nodes[i]` must have a left neighbor (another `ListNode` that is connected to it via the `le` attribute).

4. **Required Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `nodes[i].le` is not `None` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `nodes[i].le` is not `None`.

**Answer**:
State: **`i` is `q`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, `nodes[i]` is either `None` or a `ListNode` with value between `1` and `n`, and for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, if `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `nodes[i].ri` and `nodes[i].le` are either `None` or point to other `ListNode` objects within the list; `a` is an empty list; `nodes[i]` is not `None` and `nodes[i].le` is not `None`**.
