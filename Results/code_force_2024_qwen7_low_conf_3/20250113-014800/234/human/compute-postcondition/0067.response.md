Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 0, `le` and `ri` are `ListNode` objects. If `le` is true, then `le.ri` is `ri` and `ri.le` is `le`. Otherwise, `le.le` is updated to `ri.le` (denoted as `rle`) if `ri.le` is true, and `le.le` is updated to `le` and `le.ri` is updated to `ri` if `ri.le` is false.***
