`cnt` is updated by adding `seg[i]` to its current value. The value of `seg[i]` is unchanged, so the new value of `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus `seg[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `n` is at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and at most `n`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values, `seg` is a list of length `n + 1`, `ans` is the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus `seg[i]`.**
