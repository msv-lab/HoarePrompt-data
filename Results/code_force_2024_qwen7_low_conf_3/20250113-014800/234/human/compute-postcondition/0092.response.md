Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `i` is the last value of `nodes[i].ri.v` before the loop was broken.
   - `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`.
   - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - `a` contains the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken.
   - `nodes[i]` is not `None`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Condition for Continuing the Loop**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be within the range of the list `nodes` (i.e., `1 <= i <= n`).

4. **Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is set to the last value of `nodes[i].ri.v` before the loop was broken.
   - To continue the loop, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1` (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The list `nodes` remains unchanged.
   - The sequence `a` remains unchanged as it contains the values visited up to the point where the loop was broken.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `q` remains the same since it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `nodes` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken, and `nodes[i]` is not `None`.**
