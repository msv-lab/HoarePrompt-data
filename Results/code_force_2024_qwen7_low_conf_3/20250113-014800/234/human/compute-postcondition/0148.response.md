Postcondition: ***`i` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q` is at most `n`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken or terminated, and `seg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0 except for `seg[a[0]]` which is equal to 2 if `a[q]` is 0, or `seg[a[q]]` which is equal to 1 if `a[q]` is any other index from 1 to `n`, `ans` is 1, `cnt` is 0, and `nodes[i]` is True since the if condition `nodes[i]` is true***
