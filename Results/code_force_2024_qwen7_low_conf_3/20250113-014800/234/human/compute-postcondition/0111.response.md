The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. However, no variables are actually modified by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nodes[i].ri` is `False`, `i` is the final node reached in the traversal, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `i`.**
