The line of code `le.ri, ri.le = ri, le` changes the values of `le.ri` and `ri.le`. Initially, `le.ri` is `ri` which is `True`, and `ri.le` is `rle` which is `False`.

After executing the line of code:
- `le.ri` will be assigned the value of `ri`, so `le.ri` becomes `True`.
- `ri.le` will be assigned the value of `le`, so `ri.le` becomes the original `le`, which has a value of `ListNode` with value `l[0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `le` is a ListNode with value `l[0]`, `ri` is True, `rle` is a ListNode with value `l[0]`**
