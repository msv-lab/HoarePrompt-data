Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `le` is assigned the value of `nodes[l[0]]`, `ri` is assigned the value of `nodes[r[0]]`, `le` is False, `ri` is True***

This postcondition includes all the variables and their values from the precondition and updates `ri` to True based on the if condition.
