`a` is appended with the value `i`. The value of `i` remains the same as before, `q` remains unchanged, `nodes` remains unchanged, and `nodes[i].le` remains `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the index where `nodes[i].le` is `False`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `i`.

Output State: **`i` is the index where `nodes[i].le` is `False`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `i`**
