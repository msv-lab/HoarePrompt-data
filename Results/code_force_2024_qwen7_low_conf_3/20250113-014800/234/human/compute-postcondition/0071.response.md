Postcondition: **`i` is `q`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n+1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n+1` where for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, `nodes[i]` is either `None` or a `ListNode` with value between `1` and `n`, and for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, if `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `nodes[i].ri` and `nodes[i].le` are either `None` or point to other `ListNode` objects within the list; `a` is an empty list; `nodes[i]` is not `None`**
