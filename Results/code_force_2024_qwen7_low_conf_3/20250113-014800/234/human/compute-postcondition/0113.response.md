According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `i` is the final node reached in the traversal.
- `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`.
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `i`.
- If `nodes[i].ri` is `False`, these conditions hold true.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must increment by 1 and should not exceed `n + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Given that the loop breaks when `nodes[i].ri` is `False`, the next iteration would start with `i = i + 1`. For the loop to continue, `nodes[i+1].ri` must also be `False`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and ensure that `nodes[i+1].ri` is `False`.

State: **`i` is the final node reached in the traversal plus 1 (i.e., `i + 1`), `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `i`, and `nodes[i + 1].ri` is `False`.**
