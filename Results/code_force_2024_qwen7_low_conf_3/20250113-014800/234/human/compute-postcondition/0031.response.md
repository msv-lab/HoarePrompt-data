The code `le, ri = nodes[l[i]], nodes[r[i]]` assigns the value of `nodes[l[i]]` to `le` and the value of `nodes[r[i]]` to `ri`. However, the initial state does not provide the specific values of `l[i]` and `r[i]`, nor the contents of the `nodes` list. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `le` and `ri`. We know that `i` is 1 and `q` is greater than 0, but these variables are not directly affected by the given code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `le` is nodes[l[1]], `ri` is nodes[r[1]]**
