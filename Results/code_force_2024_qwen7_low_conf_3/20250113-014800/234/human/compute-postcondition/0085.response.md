`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains the values `[i, i]`. After appending `i` to `a`, the list `a` becomes `[i, i, i]`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `q`, `nodes`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing the values `[i, i, i]`**
