Let's break down the task step-by-step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

### Initial States Provided:
- `l` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq l[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\).
- `r` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq r[i] \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq q\).
- `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `None`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(q):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` until `i < q`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be within the range `[0, q-1]`.

2. **Variable `n` and `q`:**
   - `n` and `q` are derived from `func_3()`, so their exact values are unknown. However, we know that `q` is the upper bound for the loop, so `q` must be a positive integer.

3. **List `l` and `r`:**
   - Both `l` and `r` are lists of integers, and each element in these lists is bounded between 1 and `n`.
   - These lists are used within the loop, but they don't directly affect the loop's execution condition.

4. **List `nodes`:**
   - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `None`. This list is used within the loop, but its initialization doesn't affect the loop's execution condition.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the only essential state adjustments needed are related to `i` and `q`.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `i` should be set to `0` (the starting value of the loop).
- `q` should be greater than `0` (to ensure the loop can execute at least once).

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0**
