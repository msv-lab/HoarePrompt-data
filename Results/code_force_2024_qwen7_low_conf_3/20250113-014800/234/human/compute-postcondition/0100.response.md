`a` is a list that contains the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken. The code appends the value of `i` (the final node reached in the traversal) to the list `a`. Therefore, the updated list `a` will include the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is the final node reached in the traversal, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is the sequence of values visited during the traversal up to the point where the loop was broken with an additional element `i`, and `nodes[i]` is not `None` and `nodes[i].le` must remain `True`.**
