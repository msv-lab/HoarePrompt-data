`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` was previously the previous value of `cnt` plus `seg[i]` if `nodes[i]` is True, otherwise 1. Since `cnt` is incremented by 1, the new value of `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus 1 if `nodes[i]` is True, otherwise 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer and at most `n`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a sequence of values, `seg` is a list of length `n + 1`, `ans` is (`ans_initial % m` if `nodes[i]` is False, otherwise `ans_initial % m` plus `seg[i]`) times `cnt`, `cnt` is the previous value of `cnt` plus 1 if `nodes[i]` is True, otherwise 2, and `ans` is updated to be `ans % m`.
