Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `le` is `False`, `ri` is `False`. If `ri` is `True`, then `ri.le` is `l[0]` and `ri.ri` is `l[0]`. Otherwise, `nodes[l[i]]` is a ListNode with the value `l[i]`, `nodes[l[i]].ri` points to a ListNode with the value `r[i]`, `nodes[r[i]]` is a ListNode with the value `r[i]`, `nodes[r[i]].le` points to a ListNode with the value `l[i]`.***
