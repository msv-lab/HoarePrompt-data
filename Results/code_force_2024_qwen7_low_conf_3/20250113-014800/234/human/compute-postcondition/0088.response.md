`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. The initial value of `a` is `[i, i, i]`. After appending `i`, the list `a` becomes `[i, i, i, i]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing the values `[i, i, i, i]`.

Output State: **`i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing the values `[i, i, i, i]`**
