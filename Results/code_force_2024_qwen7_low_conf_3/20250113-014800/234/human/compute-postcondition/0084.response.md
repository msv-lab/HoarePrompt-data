The code `i = nodes[i].ri.v` updates the value of `i` to be the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`. The value of `nodes[i].ri.v` is not specified in the initial state, but we know that `nodes[i]` is not `None` and `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`, so `nodes[i].ri.v` exists and is a valid value.

The other variables (`q`, `nodes`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` is now the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`
- `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`
- `a` is a list containing the values `[i, i]`

Output State: **`i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`, `q` is a non-negative integer and `q <= n + 1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing the values `[i, i]`**
