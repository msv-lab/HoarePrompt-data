The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters as described in the annotations and the provided code only contains a single return statement that reads a string input from the user, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and returns it. There is no processing of `n`, `q`, `l`, or `r` as mentioned in the annotations. The function accepts user input, which must be provided through standard input, and returns the input as a string with any extra spaces removed. If no input is provided or the input is not a string, the function will still attempt to strip the whitespace, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if non-string data types are passed.
