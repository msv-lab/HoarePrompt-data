def func_1():

    #The program returns a list of q integers, each integer between 1 and n inclusive, obtained from user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads `q` integers from user input and returns them as a list. Each integer in the returned list is guaranteed to be between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function assumes that the input is provided in the format of `q` space-separated integers. If the input does not conform to this format, the `map` function will raise a `ValueError`. There are no additional error handling mechanisms included in the provided code to manage such cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i, r_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input provided by the user through the `input()` function and returns that integer. The function does not perform any additional operations on the input value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the integer input provided by the user. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does exactly what the annotations suggest.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and l and r are lists of integers where each l_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ n, and each r_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object of integers split from input, where the input is a sequence of space-separated integers that represent values for `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` based on the given constraints
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a sequence of space-separated integers from the standard input, expecting the integers to represent values for `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` based on the given constraints (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and each element in `l` and `r` is between 1 and n). It then returns a map object containing these integers. There are no specific actions performed by the function other than reading the input and splitting it into integers. This means the function assumes the input format is correct and does not handle any errors related to incorrect input format or invalid values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, l is a list of q integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ n, and r is a list of q integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns a string input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters as described in the annotations and the provided code only contains a single return statement that reads a string input from the user, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and returns it. There is no processing of `n`, `q`, `l`, or `r` as mentioned in the annotations. The function accepts user input, which must be provided through standard input, and returns the input as a string with any extra spaces removed. If no input is provided or the input is not a string, the function will still attempt to strip the whitespace, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if non-string data types are passed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, l is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q, and r is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q.

    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the final value of `ans` after all multiplications and modulo operations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of nodes), `q` (the number of operations), `l` (a list of left indices), and `r` (a list of right indices). It constructs a doubly linked list based on these indices and then performs a series of operations to compute a final value `ans`.

The function first initializes a doubly linked list using the indices from lists `l` and `r`. Each node in the list is a `ListNode` object containing values from 1 to `n`. The function then traverses the list to create a sequence `a` of unique node values starting from the smallest index and moving through both directions until no more nodes can be visited.

Next, it constructs a segment array `seg` by counting the occurrences of transitions between consecutive values in `a`. Specifically, for each pair of consecutive values in `a`, it increments the count at the maximum value of the pair.

Finally, the function iterates backward through the segment array `seg` to compute the value of `ans` by multiplying counts of segments and applying modulo operation. The function returns the final value of `ans`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes that `l` and `r` are valid lists of indices within the range [1, n]. If `l` or `r` contain invalid indices, the function would raise an error.
2. The function does not handle the case where `l[i] == r[i]` for any `i`, which could lead to incorrect segmentation.
3. The function does not validate the initial values of `n` and `q` beyond checking their bounds.
