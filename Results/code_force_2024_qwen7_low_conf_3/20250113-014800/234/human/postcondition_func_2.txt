The function reads a sequence of space-separated integers from the standard input, expecting the integers to represent values for `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` based on the given constraints (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and each element in `l` and `r` is between 1 and n). It then returns a map object containing these integers. There are no specific actions performed by the function other than reading the input and splitting it into integers. This means the function assumes the input format is correct and does not handle any errors related to incorrect input format or invalid values.
