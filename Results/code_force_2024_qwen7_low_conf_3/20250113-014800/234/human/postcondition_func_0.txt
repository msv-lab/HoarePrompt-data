The function `func_1()` reads `q` integers from user input and returns them as a list. Each integer in the returned list is guaranteed to be between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function assumes that the input is provided in the format of `q` space-separated integers. If the input does not conform to this format, the `map` function will raise a `ValueError`. There are no additional error handling mechanisms included in the provided code to manage such cases.
