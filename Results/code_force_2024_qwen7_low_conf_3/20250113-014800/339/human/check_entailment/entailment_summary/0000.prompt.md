You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
There are n monsters standing in a row. The i -th monster has a_i health
points.

Every second, you can choose one alive monster and launch a chain lightning at
it. The lightning deals k damage to it, and also spreads to the left (towards
decreasing i ) and to the right (towards increasing i ) to alive monsters,
dealing k damage to each. When the lightning reaches a dead monster or the
beginning/end of the row, it stops. A monster is considered alive if its
health points are strictly greater than 0 .

For example, consider the following scenario: there are three monsters with
health equal to [5, 2, 7] , and k = 3 . You can kill them all in 4 seconds:

  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -rd monster, then their health values are [2, -1, 4] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 1 -st monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, 4] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -rd monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, 1] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -th monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, -2] . 

For each k from 1 to \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) , calculate the minimum number
of seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5 ) — the number of
monsters.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^5 )
— the health points of the i -th monster.

Output

For each k from 1 to \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) , output the minimum number of
seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.

# Execution Summary:
The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and each integer in the list satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\). It first sorts the indices of the list `a` based on the values in `a`. Then, it initializes several auxiliary lists and variables. During the first for loop, it populates the list `f` with a specific value `g` and updates the `bits` list. Finally, it prints the sum of selected elements from the list `f` for each divisor `d` of `m`, where `m` is the maximum value in the original list `a`.
