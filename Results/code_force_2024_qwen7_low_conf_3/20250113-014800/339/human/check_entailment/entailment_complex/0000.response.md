Reasoning:
1. **Function Logic**: The function aims to calculate the minimum time required to kill all monsters for each possible value of \( k \) from 1 to the maximum health point of any monster. The logic involves sorting the monsters based on their health points and then using a series of operations to determine the minimum number of seconds needed.

2. **Sorting and Initialization**: 
   - The monsters are sorted based on their health points.
   - Several auxiliary lists (`f`, `wtr`, `bits`) are initialized.
   - The variable `g` is updated during the loop, which seems to be related to the cumulative effect of applying the chain lightning.

3. **First Loop Execution**:
   - For each monster's health value, the loop appends a value to the list `f`. This value appears to be related to the number of steps required to kill monsters with the current `g` value.
   - The `bits` list is updated to reflect the changes in the number of alive monsters.

4. **Second Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over all possible values of \( k \) from 1 to the maximum health point.
   - For each \( k \), it calculates the sum of selected elements from the list `f`, which represents the minimum number of seconds required to kill all monsters if the chain lightning deals \( k \) damage per hit.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each \( k \) in the required format.

Given the provided comments and the overall logic of the function, the code appears to correctly implement the problem statement. The function correctly processes the input, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the results in the specified format.

Correctness: **True**
