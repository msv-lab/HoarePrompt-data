You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n monsters standing in a row. The i -th monster has a_i health
points.

Every second, you can choose one alive monster and launch a chain lightning at
it. The lightning deals k damage to it, and also spreads to the left (towards
decreasing i ) and to the right (towards increasing i ) to alive monsters,
dealing k damage to each. When the lightning reaches a dead monster or the
beginning/end of the row, it stops. A monster is considered alive if its
health points are strictly greater than 0 .

For example, consider the following scenario: there are three monsters with
health equal to [5, 2, 7] , and k = 3 . You can kill them all in 4 seconds:

  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -rd monster, then their health values are [2, -1, 4] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 1 -st monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, 4] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -rd monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, 1] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -th monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, -2] . 

For each k from 1 to \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) , calculate the minimum number
of seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5 ) — the number of
monsters.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^5 )
— the health points of the i -th monster.

Output

For each k from 1 to \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) , output the minimum number of
seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    N = int(input())
    ans = []
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [(i, a[i]) for i in range(len(a))]
    S = sorted(b, key=lambda x: x[1])
    m = max(a)
    bits = [0] + [1] * N + [0]
    wtr = [[] for q in range(N)]
    f = []
    g = 1
    last = 0
    for (i, num) in S:
        for e in range(num - last):
            f.append(g)
        
        last = num
        
        bits[i + 1] = 0
        
        g += bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is a list containing `m` elements, each equal to `g` after the loop; `last` is equal to `m`; `bits` is updated such that `bits[i + 1] = 0` for each index `i` corresponding to an executed iteration of the inner loop; `g` is `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1` for each executed iteration of the inner loop. If the loop does not execute, `f` remains an empty list, `last` is `0`, `bits` remains as initially defined, and `g` is `1`.
    for d in range(1, m + 1):
        print(sum([f[d * x] for x in range(1 + (m - 1) // d)]), end=' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is a list containing `m` elements, each equal to `g`, `last` is `m`, `bits` remains as initially defined, `g` is `1`, and `m` is at least `1`. The loop does not execute further because `d` starts from `1` and goes up to `m+1`, and for `d=m+1`, there are no valid `x` values in the range `0` to `(m-1)//d` since `(m-1)//(m+1)` is always `0`. Therefore, the sum of selected elements from `f` is `0`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
