The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and each integer in the list satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\). It first sorts the indices of the list `a` based on the values in `a`. Then, it initializes several auxiliary lists and variables. During the first for loop, it populates the list `f` with a specific value `g` and updates the `bits` list. Finally, it prints the sum of selected elements from the list `f` for each divisor `d` of `m`, where `m` is the maximum value in the original list `a`.
