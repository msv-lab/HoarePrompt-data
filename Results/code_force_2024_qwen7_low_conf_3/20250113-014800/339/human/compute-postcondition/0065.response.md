The code appends the current value of `operations` to the `results` list. Since `operations` is equal to `n`, the value of `n` is added to the `results` list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `operations` is equal to `n`; `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` where each element is reduced by `k * n` if it was originally greater than 0, and each adjacent element (to the left and right) is reduced by `k * n` if applicable; `max_health` is at least 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` (which is now `n`); `health` is a list of positive integers.**
