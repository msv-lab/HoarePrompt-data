Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of monsters, and `health`, a list of positive integers where each integer represents the health points of the i-th monster. It calculates the number of operations required to reduce each corresponding health point in the `health` list to zero, starting from the highest possible reduction factor `k`. For each value of `k` from 1 to the maximum health point, it simulates reducing the health points by `k` and counts the number of operations (decrements) needed. It stores these counts in a list `results` and returns it.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If all monsters have health points equal to zero initially, the function will still iterate through all values of `k` up to the maximum health, but the `results` list will contain zeros because no operations are needed.
- If the `health` list contains negative values or non-integer values, the function will not handle these cases correctly since the code assumes all elements in `health` are positive integers. The function should include validation to ensure all elements in `health` are positive integers.
- If `n` is zero, the function will still execute the loops, which may lead to unnecessary operations. The function should handle this case by returning an empty list if `n` is zero.
