Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `f` is a list containing `m` elements, each equal to `1`.
   - `last` is `m`.
   - `bits` remains as initially defined.
   - `g` is `1`.
   - `m` is at least `1`.
   - `d` is `m + 1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   print(sum([f[d * x] for x in range(1 + (m - 1) // d)]), end=' ')
   ```

3. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code calculates the sum of elements from the list `f` using a list comprehension.
   - The list comprehension `[f[d * x] for x in range(1 + (m - 1) // d)]` generates a list of elements from `f` where the index is `d * x` for each `x` in the range `range(1 + (m - 1) // d)`.
   - Since `d` is `m + 1`, `d * x` will always be out of bounds for the list `f` because the maximum index of `f` is `m-1`. Hence, the list comprehension will be empty.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of an empty list is `0`.

5. **Output**:
   - The value `0` is printed.

6. **Post-Execution State**:
   - The variables `f`, `last`, `bits`, `g`, and `d` remain unchanged.
   - The value of `m` is still at least `1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`f` is a list containing `m` elements, each equal to `1`; `last` is `m`; `bits` remains as initially defined; `g` is `1`; `m` is at least `1`; `d` is `m + 1`; the sum of the selected elements from `f` is `0`.**
