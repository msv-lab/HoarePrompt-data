To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `S` must be a non-empty list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\).
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple.
- `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `bits` is a list of length `n + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `n` ones, and ending with `0`.
- `wtr` is a list of `n` sublists, each being an empty list.
- `f` is now `[1]`.
- `g` is `1`.
- `last` is `0`.
- `num` must be at least 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `e` where `e` ranges from `0` to `num - last - 1`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `e in range(num - last)` means the loop will continue as long as `e < num - last`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `e` was incremented by 1.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `e` must be less than `num - last`.

Given that `e` was incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `e` as `e_new = e + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need:
\[ e_{new} < num - last \]
\[ e + 1 < num - last \]
\[ e < num - last - 1 \]

Since `e` was the last value that satisfied the loop condition, the new value of `e` should be `num - last - 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `S` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `ans` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `bits` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `wtr` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `f` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `g` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `last` remains `0` as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `num` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop directly.
- `e` is updated to `num - last - 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`S` must be a non-empty list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `n + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `n` ones, and ending with `0`, `wtr` is a list of `n` sublists, each being an empty list, `f` is now `[1]`, `g` is `1`, `last` is `0`, and `e` is `num - last - 1`.**
