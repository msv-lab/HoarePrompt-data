The code snippet `f.append(g)` appends the value of `g` to the list `f`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific values for `f` or `g`. The only condition given is that `num - last` must be greater than 0, which is not directly related to the variables `f` and `g`. 

After executing the code, the list `f` will contain one additional element, which is `g`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num - last` must be greater than 0; `f` is a list with an additional element `g` appended to it**
