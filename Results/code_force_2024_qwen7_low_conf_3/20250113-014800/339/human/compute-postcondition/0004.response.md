The code sorts the list of tuples `b` based on the second element of each tuple, which is the value from list `a`. The original lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, but `b` is now sorted.

- `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\).
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a`, and now these tuples are sorted based on the element part of each tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\); `ans` is an empty list; `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple.**
