The code `results.append(operations)` appends the value of the variable `operations` to the list `results`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `results` or `operations`, we can only say that `operations` is appended to `results`.

Output State: **`results` is a list with an additional element `operations`, `operations` is unchanged**
