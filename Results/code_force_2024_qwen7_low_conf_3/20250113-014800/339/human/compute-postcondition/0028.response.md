The code snippet appends the variable `g` to the list `f`. Given that `num - last` is 2, the list `f` initially has `num - last + 1` elements, which means `f` has 3 elements. However, the code does not specify the initial contents of `f` or the value of `g`, so we only know that `f` will have one more element after appending `g`.

Output State: **`num - last` is 2; `f` is a list with 4 elements; `f` contains its original 3 elements plus `g`.**
