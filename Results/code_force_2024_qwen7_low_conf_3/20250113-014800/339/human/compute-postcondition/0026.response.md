The code `f.append(g)` appends the element `g` to the list `f`. This means that the list `f` now contains an additional element `g`. The value of `num - last` being greater than 1 is a precondition and remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `f` and the unchanged precondition.

Output State: **`num - last` is greater than 1, `f` is a list with an additional element `g` appended to it**
