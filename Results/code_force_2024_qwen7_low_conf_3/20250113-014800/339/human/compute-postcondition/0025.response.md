According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num - last`. The loop continues as long as `num - last` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `num - last` must be greater than 0, and `f` is a list with an additional element `g` appended to it.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to:

1. Check if the condition `num - last > 0` still holds.
2. Since `e` is in the range of `num - last`, `e` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so `num - last` decreases by 1.
3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num - last` must be greater than 1 (because it was initially greater than 0 and now needs to be greater than the new value after decrementing).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `num - last` must be greater than 1.
- `f` is a list with an additional element `g` appended to it.

State: **`num - last` must be greater than 1, `f` is a list with an additional element `g` appended to it**
