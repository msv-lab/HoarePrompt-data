`current_health[i]` is decremented by `k`. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `current_health[i]` will be updated accordingly. The other elements of `current_health` remain unchanged. The value of `n` and `operations` remain the same.

Given that `current_health[0]` is already updated to `current_health[0] - k`, this subtraction is not repeated. Therefore, the only change is in `current_health[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `current_health[i]` is `current_health[i] - k`; `current_health[0]` is `current_health[0] - k`; `current_health[1]` or `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`; `n` must be greater than 0; and `operations` is 3**
