`last` is assigned the value of `num`. This means that the value of `num` becomes the new value of `last`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num - last` must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed; `f` is a list with `num - last` + 1 elements; `f` contains its original elements plus `g` appended `num - last` times; `last` is now equal to `num`.

Output State: **`num - last` must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed; `f` is a list with `num - last` + 1 elements; `f` contains its original elements plus `g` appended `num - last` times; `last` is equal to `num`**
