`current_health[i + 1]` is updated by subtracting `k` from its current value. Since `i` is 2, `current_health[i + 1]` refers to `current_health[3]`. The value of `n` is not directly used in this operation, but the condition `n > 2` is still valid. The value of `operations` is increased by 1, but the exact value is not given, so we only know it is 1 more than its initial value.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `current_health[1]` is decreased by `k`, `operations` is 1 more than its initial value, `current_health[3]` is decreased by `k`, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
