`current_health[i - 1]` is updated by subtracting `k` from its current value. Given that `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1. So, `current_health[1]` is decreased by `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `current_health[1]` is decreased by `k`; `operations` is 1 more than its initial value; and `n` must be greater than 2.**
