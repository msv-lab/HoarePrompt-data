Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1. `current_health[0]` is `current_health[0] - k`, and one of `current_health[1]` or `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`. `n` is greater than 0 and `operations` is 2. If `i >= n - 1`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition: `current_health[0]` is `current_health[0] - k` and one of `current_health[1]` or `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`, with `n` being greater than 0 and `operations` being 2. If `i` is 1 and `i < n - 1`, then `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`. If `i` is 0 and `i < n - 1`, then `current_health[1]` is decreased by `k`.***
