According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num - last`. The loop will execute as long as `e` is less than `num - last`. At the end of the last iteration, `num - last` is at least 2, `f` has at least 1 element and an additional element `g`, and `last` is equal to `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `num - last` must be at least 3 because `e` needs to be incremented from its previous value, which means `num - last` should now be greater than the previous value.
2. `f` must still have at least 1 element and an additional element `g`.
3. `last` must still be equal to `num`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be adjusted as follows:
- `num - last` must be at least 3.
- `f` must have at least 1 element and an additional element `g`.
- `last` must be equal to `num`.

State: **`num - last` is at least 3, `f` has at least 1 element and an additional element `g`, `last` is equal to `num`**
