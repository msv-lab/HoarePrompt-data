To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions specified in the for loop and the initial state given.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `num - last` must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed + 1.
   - `f` is a list with `num - last` + 1 elements.
   - `last` is equal to the current `num`.
   - `g` is updated to `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1` inside the loop.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(num - last)`, meaning it will execute from `0` to `num - last - 1`.

3. **Key Considerations**:
   - For the loop to start, `num - last` must be a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0).
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `num - last - 1`, `num - last` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.

4. **Updating States**:
   - Before the loop starts, `last` should be set to the current value of `num`.
   - The list `f` must have `num - last + 1` elements, which means it should have at least `1` element (since `num - last` must be at least 1).

### Adjusted States:
- To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `num - last` must be at least 1.
- The list `f` should have at least `1` element.
- The variable `last` should be set to the current value of `num`.

### Final State:
State: **`num - last` is at least 1, `f` is a list with at least 1 element, `last` is equal to the current `num`**
