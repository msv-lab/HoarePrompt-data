`m` is assigned the maximum value in the list `a`. The maximum value of `a` is determined but the specific value of `m` depends on the contents of `a`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\); `ans` is an empty list; `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple; `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
