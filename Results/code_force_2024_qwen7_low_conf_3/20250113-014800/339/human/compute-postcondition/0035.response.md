`f` is a list with at least 1 element, and `g` is appended to this list. The value of `num - last` is at least 1, and `last` is equal to the current `num`. Since the value of `g` is not specified, it remains as is in the context of the list `f`.

Output State: **`num - last` is at least 1, `f` is a list with at least 1 element and an additional element `g`, `last` is equal to the current `num`**
