The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, and `health`, which is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the health points of the i-th monster. After executing the function body, it returns a list `results`, which contains the number of operations required to reduce each corresponding health point in the original `health` list to zero, starting from the highest possible reduction factor `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of positive integers `health`, and return a list of integers `results` representing the number of operations needed to reduce each health point to zero.
