The code creates a new list `b` using a list comprehension. This list comprehension iterates over the indices of list `a` and creates tuples `(i, a[i])`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and the original list `a` is preserved.

The output state will include the updated value of `b`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an index `i` and the corresponding element `a[i]` from the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\); `ans` is an empty list; `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a`.**
