`f` is a list that appends the element `g`. Initially, `f` has at least one element and an additional element `g`. After appending `g` to `f`, the length of `f` increases by 1, making it have at least two elements. The states of the other variables (`num - last` and `last`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`num - last` is at least 3, `f` has at least two elements, `last` is equal to `num`**
