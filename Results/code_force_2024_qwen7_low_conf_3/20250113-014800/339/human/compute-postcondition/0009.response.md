The code `g = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `g`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `g` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\); `ans` is an empty list; `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple; `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `bits` is a list of length `n + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `n` ones, and ending with `0`; `wtr` is a list of `n` sublists, each being an empty list; `f` is an empty list; `g` is `1`.**
