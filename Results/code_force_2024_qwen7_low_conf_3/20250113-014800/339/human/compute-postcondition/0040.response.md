Output State: **`num - last` is at least the number of times the loop has executed + 1, `f` is a list with at least `num - last` elements, each element in `f` is equal to `g` after the loop, `last` is equal to `num`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop runs `num - last` times, where `num - last` must be at least the number of times the loop has executed + 1. This means that if the loop executes \( k \) times, then `num - last` is at least \( k + 1 \).
- Each iteration of the loop appends the value of `g` to the list `f`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `f` will contain `num - last` elements, all of which are equal to `g` (the final value of `g` after the loop).
- The variable `last` is set to the current `num` at the beginning of each iteration, so after the loop finishes, `last` will be equal to `num`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `num - last` is 0), then `f` remains an empty list, and `last` will be equal to `num`.
