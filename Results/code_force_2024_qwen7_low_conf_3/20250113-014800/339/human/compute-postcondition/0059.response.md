The code `current_health[i - 1] -= k` subtracts `k` from `current_health[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is either 1 or 2. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `i` is 1:
   - `current_health[0]` is currently `current_health[0] - k`.
   - The code will modify `current_health[0]` again, resulting in `current_health[0] - 2k`.

2. If `i` is 2:
   - `current_health[1]` is currently `current_health[1] - k`.
   - The code will modify `current_health[1]` again, resulting in `current_health[1] - 2k`.

In both cases, `n` remains greater than 0 and `operations` remains 3.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is 1 or 2.
- `current_health[0]` is `current_health[0] - 2k` if `i` is 1, otherwise it remains `current_health[0] - k`.
- `current_health[1]` is `current_health[1] - 2k` if `i` is 2, otherwise it remains `current_health[1] - k`.
- `current_health[2]` remains unchanged.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `operations` is 3.

Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `current_health[0]` is `current_health[0] - 2k` if `i` is 1, otherwise it is `current_health[0] - k`; `current_health[1]` is `current_health[1] - 2k` if `i` is 2, otherwise it is `current_health[1] - k`; `current_health[2]` is unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; `operations` is 3**
