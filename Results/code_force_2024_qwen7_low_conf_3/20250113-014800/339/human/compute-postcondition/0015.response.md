The code `f.append(g)` appends the value of `g` to the list `f`. Before this line of code, `f` is initialized as `[1]` and `g` is `1`. After appending `g` to `f`, `f` becomes `[1, 1]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` must be a non-empty list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `n + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `n` ones, and ending with `0`, `wtr` is a list of `n` sublists, each being an empty list, `f` is now `[1, 1]`, `g` is `1`, `last` is `0`, and `e` is `num - last - 1`.**
