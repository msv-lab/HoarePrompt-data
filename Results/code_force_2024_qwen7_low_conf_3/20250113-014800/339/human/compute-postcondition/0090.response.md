`current_health[i]` is updated by subtracting `k` from its current value. Since `i` is 2, the specific variable being updated is `current_health[2]`. The value of `i` remains 2, and `operations` is an integer that is 1 more than its initial value (meaning `operations` is now equal to its initial value plus 1). The state of `n` is unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`, `operations` is 1 more than its initial value, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
