Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `current_health[0]` is greater than 0 - k, and `operations` is 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then `i` is set to 1, `current_health[0]` is greater than 0 - 2k, and `i` is less than n - 1. Otherwise, `i` remains 0, and `i` is less than n - 1.***
