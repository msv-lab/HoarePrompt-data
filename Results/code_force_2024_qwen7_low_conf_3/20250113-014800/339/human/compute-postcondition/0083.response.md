The code subtracts `k` from `current_health[i - 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `current_health[1]` is decreased by `k`, and `operations` is 2, the value of `current_health[0]` (since `i - 1` equals 0) is decreased by `k`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `current_health[0]` is decreased by `k`; `operations` is 2**
