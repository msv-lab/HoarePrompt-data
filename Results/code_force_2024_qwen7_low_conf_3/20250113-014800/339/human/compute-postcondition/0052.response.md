The function `func` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `a` is `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`. Each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5`. The function does not directly return a value based on the provided information, but rather seems to imply some operation or condition based on the list `a`. However, since no specific operation or return value is detailed, we focus solely on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers where the length of the list is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and each integer in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5.**
