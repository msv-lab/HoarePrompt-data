Postcondition: ***`i` is 1 or 2, `current_health[0]` is either `current_health[0] - 2k` or `current_health[0] - 4k`, `current_health[1]` is either `current_health[1] - k` or `current_health[1] - 2k`, `current_health[2]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, and `operations` is 3, provided that `current_health[i] > 0`. If `current_health[i]` is not greater than 0, the postcondition remains as initially stated before the if statement execution.***
