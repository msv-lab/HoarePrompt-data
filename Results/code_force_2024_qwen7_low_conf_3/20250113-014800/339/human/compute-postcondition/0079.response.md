Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `current_health[0]` is greater than 0 - `k`, and `operations` is 1. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `i` is incremented by 1, and either `current_health[1]` or `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.***
