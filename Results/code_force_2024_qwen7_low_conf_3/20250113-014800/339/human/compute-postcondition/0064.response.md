Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is equal to `n`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` where each element is reduced by `k * n` if it was originally greater than 0, and each adjacent element (to the left and right) is reduced by `k * n` if applicable, `max_health` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, and `health` is a list of positive integers.**
