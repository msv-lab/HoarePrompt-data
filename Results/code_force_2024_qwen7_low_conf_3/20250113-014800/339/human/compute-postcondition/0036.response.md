Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num - last` is at least 1, meaning `num - last >= 1`.
   - `f` is a list with at least 1 element.
   - There is an additional element `g` in the list `f`.
   - `last` is equal to the current `num`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for e in range(num - last):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points:**
   - The loop runs from `e = 0` to `e = num - last - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `num - last` must be greater than 0 (which it already is) and `num - last - 1` should be valid.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(num - last)`, the variable `e` will increment by 1 each time the loop runs.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `num - last` must be greater than 1 (so `e` can go from 0 to 1).
   - Therefore, `num` must be incremented by 1 to make `num - last` greater than 1.
   - `last` remains the same as it is equal to the current `num`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `num - last` must be at least 2 (since it was at least 1 before, and now we want it to be at least 2 for the next iteration).
   - `f` still has at least 1 element and an additional element `g`.
   - `last` remains the same as it is equal to the current `num`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`num - last` is at least 2, `f` is a list with at least 1 element and an additional element `g`, `last` is equal to the current `num + 1`**.
