The code `wtr = [[] for q in range(N)]` initializes a list `wtr` with `N` sublists, each of which is an empty list. Here, `N` is the value of `n` from the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\)
- `ans` is an empty list
- `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple
- `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `bits` is a list of length `n + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `n` ones, and ending with `0`

After executing the code `wtr = [[] for q in range(n)]`, the list `wtr` is initialized with `n` sublists, each being an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\); `ans` is an empty list; `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple; `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `bits` is a list of length `n + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `n` ones, and ending with `0`; `wtr` is a list of `n` sublists, each being an empty list.**
