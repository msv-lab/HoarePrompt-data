The code updates the value of `current_health[i + 1]` by subtracting `k`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` becomes 2. So, `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`.

The initial conditions are:
- `i` is 1
- `current_health[1]` is decreased by `k`
- `current_health[0]` is decreased by `k`
- `operations` is 2

After executing the code `current_health[i + 1] -= k`:
- `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` remains 1
- `current_health[0]` is decreased by `k`
- `current_health[1]` is decreased by `k`
- `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`
- `operations` is incremented by 1 (becomes 3)

Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_health[0]` is decreased by `k`, `current_health[1]` is decreased by `k`, `current_health[2]` is decreased by `k`, `operations` is 3**
