The code initializes an empty list `ans`. No values are assigned to `ans` directly in the given code snippet. The initial state of `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\). However, no operations are performed on `ans` or any other variables that would change their values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\); `ans` is an empty list.**
