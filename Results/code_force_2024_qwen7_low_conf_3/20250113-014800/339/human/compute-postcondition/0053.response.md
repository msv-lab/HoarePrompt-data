Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and each integer in the list satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\). It first sorts the indices of the list `a` based on the values in `a`. Then, it initializes several auxiliary lists and variables. During the first for loop, it populates the list `f` with a specific value `g` and updates the `bits` list. Finally, it prints the sum of selected elements from the list `f` for each divisor `d` of `m`, where `m` is the maximum value in the original list `a`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the input list `a` is empty. In such a scenario, the code would raise an error when attempting to access elements of an empty list.
- The function does not provide any error handling for invalid inputs such as non-integer values in the list `a` or a length `n` outside the specified range.
- The function assumes that `m` (the maximum value in the list `a`) is at least 1. If `m` were 0, the second for loop would never execute, and the function would print nothing. However, the input constraints ensure that `m` is always at least 1.
