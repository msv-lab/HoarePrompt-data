To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- The initial state includes `g` being updated to `g + bits[i_current + 1] + bits[i_current + 3] - 1`.
- The values of `bits` at indices `i_current + 1` and `i_current + 3` are updated accordingly.
- Other variables remain in their initial state.

### For Loop:
```
for e in range(num - last):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `e = 0` to `e < (num - last)`. This means the loop will execute if `(num - last)` is greater than 0.
2. **Variables Involved**: The loop does not directly modify `g` or the `bits` array. However, it relies on the value of `num` and `last`.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop requires `(num - last)` to be greater than 0. If `(num - last)` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
- **No Direct Modification**: Since the loop does not directly modify `g` or the `bits` array, no further adjustments to these specific variables are required based on the loop itself.

### Conclusion:
The only state adjustment needed is to ensure that the condition for the loop to execute is met, i.e., `(num - last)` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
**State: `num - last` must be greater than 0**
