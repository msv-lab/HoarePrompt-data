`N` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `N` will hold the integer input from the user. The initial state of `n` as an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) is still valid, and the list `a` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5; N` is the integer input from the user**
