Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `operations` is 0.
- `k` is 2.
- `max_health` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` (including `n` and possibly others).
- `health` is a list of positive integers.
- `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` where each element is reduced by `2 * n` if it was originally greater than 0, and each adjacent element (to the left and right) is reduced by `2 * n` if applicable.

### For Loop:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should start at 0 and increment until `i < n`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` is already given as a positive integer, the main condition here is ensuring that `i` starts from 0 and iterates up to `n-1`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `operations`, `k`, `max_health`, `results`, `health`, and `current_health` do not directly affect the loop condition or the loop body. They remain unchanged during the loop execution based on the provided information.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` needs to start at 0.
- `i` needs to iterate up to `n-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
