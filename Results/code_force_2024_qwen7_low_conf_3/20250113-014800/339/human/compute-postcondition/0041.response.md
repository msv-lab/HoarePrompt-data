The code `last = num` simply reassigns the value of `last` to be equal to `num`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the `num - last` condition remains valid since `num` is now equal to `last`.

Output State: **`num - last` is 1, `f` is a list with at least `num - last` elements, each element in `f` is equal to `g` after the loop, `last` is equal to `num`**
