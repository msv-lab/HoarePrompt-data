The code `g += bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1` increments the value of `g` by the sum of `bits[i]`, `bits[i + 2]`, and subtracts 1. However, the exact values of `i` and the contents of `bits` are not specified. Therefore, we can only express `g` in terms of its current value and the unspecified parts of `bits`.

- The value of `g` is updated to `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`.
- The value of `bits` remains unchanged except for the elements at indices `i` and `i + 2`.
- All other variables (`S`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, `b`, `m`, `bits`, `wtr`, `f`, `g`, `last`, and `num`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`g` is updated to `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`; `bits` at index `i` and `i + 2` are updated accordingly; other variables are the same as the initial state.**
