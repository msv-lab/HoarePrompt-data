`current_health[i - 1]` is decremented by `k`. Given that `i` is 1, `current_health[i - 1]` is the same as `current_health[0]`. The initial state mentions that `current_health[0]` is greater than `0 - k`. After subtracting `k` from `current_health[0]`, the new value of `current_health[0]` will be greater than `0 - k - k` or `0 - 2k`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `operations`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `current_health[0]` is greater than 0 - 2k, and `operations` is 1**
