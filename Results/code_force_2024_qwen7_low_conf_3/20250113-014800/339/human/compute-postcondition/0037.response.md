`f` appends the element `g` to itself. The length of `f` increases by 1. The value of `last` remains the same as it is equal to the current `num`. The value of `g` is added to `f`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num - last` is at least 2, `f` has at least 1 element and an additional element `g`, `last` is equal to `num`.**
