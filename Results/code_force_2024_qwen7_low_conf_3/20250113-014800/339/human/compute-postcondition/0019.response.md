The code `last = num` simply assigns the value of `num` to the variable `last`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `last`.

Output State: **`S` must be a non-empty list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form (index, element) from list `a` and is sorted based on the element part of each tuple, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `n + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `n` ones, and ending with `0`, `wtr` is a list of `n` sublists, each being an empty list, `f` is a list of `num` ones, `g` is `1`, `last` is `num`, and `num` is the total number of iterations, which must be at least `num`.**
