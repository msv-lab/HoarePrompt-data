Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `operations` is equal to `n`.
   - `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` where each element is reduced by `k * n` if it was originally greater than 0, and each adjacent element (to the left and right) is reduced by `k * n` if applicable.
   - `max_health` is at least 1.
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` (which is now `n`).
   - `health` is a list of positive integers.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `max_health + 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
   - Since the loop is iterating from `k = 1` to `k = max_health + 1`, the current value of `k` is 1 at the start of the first iteration and will increment by 1 each time the loop runs.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `max_health`.
   - After the first iteration, `k` will be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `k` should be 2 and the condition `k <= max_health` must still hold true (which means `max_health` must be at least 2).

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `k` will be incremented to 2.
   - `operations` remains unchanged as it does not depend on `k`.
   - `current_health` will be updated based on the new value of `k`, but we do not have specific details on how this update occurs in the problem description.
   - `max_health` remains unchanged.
   - `results` will contain the updated value of `operations` after each iteration, so it will include `n` and potentially other values depending on the loop body.
   - `health` remains unchanged as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

- `k` becomes 2.
- `results` will be updated to include the new value of `operations`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `k` is 2, `operations` is equal to `n`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` where each element is reduced by `2 * n` if it was originally greater than 0, and each adjacent element (to the left and right) is reduced by `2 * n` if applicable, `max_health` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` (including `n` and possibly others), and `health` is a list of positive integers.**
