Output State: **`f` is a list containing `m` elements, each equal to `g` after the loop; `last` is equal to `m`; `bits` is updated such that `bits[i + 1] = 0` for each index `i` corresponding to an executed iteration of the inner loop; `g` is `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1` for each executed iteration of the inner loop. If the loop does not execute, `f` remains an empty list, `last` is `0`, `bits` remains as initially defined, and `g` is `1`.**
