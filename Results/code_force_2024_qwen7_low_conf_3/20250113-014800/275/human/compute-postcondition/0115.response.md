Postcondition: ***`cell` is `field[i][j]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `quaffle` remains unchanged. If `cell` is `.Q`, the player at this cell has the quaffle. Otherwise, if `cell` is `.B`, the bludger is now located at `(i, j)` and the player at this cell has the quaffle. In all other cases, the bludger remains unchanged and the player at this cell has the quaffle as long as `cell` is not `'..'`.***
