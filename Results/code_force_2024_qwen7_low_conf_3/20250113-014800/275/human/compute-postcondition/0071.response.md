The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. Given the initial values, `i` is 1 and `j` is `M-2`. Therefore, `quaffle` is assigned the value `(1, M-2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-2`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-2]`, `quaffle` is `(1, M-2)`**
