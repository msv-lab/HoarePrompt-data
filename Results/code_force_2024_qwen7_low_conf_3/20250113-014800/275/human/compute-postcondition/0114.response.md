Postcondition: ***`cell` is now `field[i][j]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `quaffle` remains unchanged. If `cell` is `.B`, `bludger` is now `(i, j)` and `players[cell]` contains the entry with `{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`. Otherwise, `bludger` remains unchanged and `players[cell]` contains the entry with `{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}` as long as `cell` is not `'..'`.***
