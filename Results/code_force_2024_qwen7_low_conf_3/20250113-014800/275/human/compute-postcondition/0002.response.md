The code defines a constant `MOD` which is set to \(10^9 + 7\). This does not affect any existing variables but sets a new constant that can be used in further computations. The initial state includes the input format and the pre-defined `data` list, but the given code snippet only initializes `MOD` and does not alter any existing values or structures.

Output State: **MOD is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters.**
