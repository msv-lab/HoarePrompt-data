The code `N, M = map(int, data[0].split())` takes the first line of the input (which is a string in the list `data`) splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns them to `N` and `M` respectively. 

- `MOD` remains unchanged and is still \(10^9 + 7\).
- `data` is not affected by this operation and still contains the list of lines from the input split by newline characters.
- `N` is assigned the first integer from the first line of `data`.
- `M` is assigned the second integer from the first line of `data`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\); `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters; `N` is the first integer from the first line of `data`; `M` is the second integer from the first line of `data`.**
