The code appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state:

- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters
- `N` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `M` must be greater than 0
- `j` is `M-2`
- `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-2]`

The variable `goals[cell]` is updated by appending the tuple `(i, j)`. Since the exact content of `goals` before this operation is not specified, we only know that `goals[cell]` now contains the tuple `(1, M-2)`.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-2`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-2]`, `goals[cell]` is `[ (1, M-2) ]`**
