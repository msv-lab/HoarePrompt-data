`blue_score` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`goals`, `quaffle`, and `events`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `goals` dictionary must contain at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, `events` is updated based on the current `goal_type` and `entity`, and `blue_score` is increased by 1.
