Postcondition: ***`goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`. If `goal_type == 'RG'` and `entity[0] == 'B'`, or if `goal_type == 'BG'` and `entity[0] == 'R'`, then `red_score` is incremented by 1 if `entity[0] == 'R'`, otherwise `blue_score` is increased by 1. `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`. `events` is appended with either `f'{t} RED GOAL'` or `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'` based on the condition satisfied. We break out of the nearest enclosing loop or match statement if there was one.***
