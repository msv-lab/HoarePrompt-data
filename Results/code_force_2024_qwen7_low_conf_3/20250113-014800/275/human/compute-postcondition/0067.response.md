Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`. If `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals[cell]` contains the additional element (1, M-1). Otherwise, if `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is (1, M-1). If `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is set to (1, M-1). For any other `cell`, `players[cell]` is updated to `{'pos': (1, M-1), 'has_quaffle': False}`.***
