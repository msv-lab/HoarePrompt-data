Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is the last index in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`. If `cell` is in (`'RG'`, `'BG'`), then `goals[cell]` contains all tuples `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are determined by the loop's execution. If `cell` is `'.'`, `quaffle` is `(0, j)` if `cell` was `'.'` and the loop executed at least once, otherwise it remains undefined. If `cell` is `.B`, `bludger` is `(0, j)` if `cell` was `.B` and the loop executed at least once, otherwise it remains undefined. If `cell` is neither `.Q`, `.B`, `'RG'`, nor `'BG'`, `players[cell]` is a dictionary with `{'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False}` if `cell` was neither `.Q`, `.B`, `'RG'`, nor `'BG'` and the loop executed at least once, otherwise it remains undefined.**
