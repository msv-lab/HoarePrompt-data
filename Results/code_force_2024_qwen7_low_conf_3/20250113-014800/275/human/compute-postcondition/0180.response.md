The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match statement. Since there is no loop or match statement in the given code snippet, the execution simply ends after the `break` statement without affecting any variables.

Output State: **`goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`; if `goal_type == 'RG'` and `entity[0] == 'B'`, or if `goal_type == 'BG'` and `entity[0] == 'R'`, then `red_score` is incremented by 1 if `entity[0] == 'R'`, otherwise `blue_score` is increased by 1; `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`; `events` is appended with either `f'{t} RED GOAL'` or `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'` based on the condition satisfied; we break out of the nearest enclosing loop or match statement if there was one.**
