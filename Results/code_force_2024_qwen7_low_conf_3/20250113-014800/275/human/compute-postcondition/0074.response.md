Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-2`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-2]`, and if `cell` is not equal to `'..'`, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (1, M-2), 'has_quaffle': False}`. If `cell` is equal to `'..'`, the state remains unchanged.***
