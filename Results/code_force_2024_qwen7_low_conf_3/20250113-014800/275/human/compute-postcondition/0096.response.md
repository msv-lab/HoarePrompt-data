The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. This means that `quaffle` now holds the coordinates `i, j`. The values of `cell`, `field`, `i`, `j`, and `quaffle` are updated as follows:

- `cell` remains unchanged and is still `'.Q'`.
- `field` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` remains unchanged.
- `quaffle` is now the tuple `(i, j)`.

Output State: **`cell` is '.Q', `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, `quaffle` is (i, j)**
