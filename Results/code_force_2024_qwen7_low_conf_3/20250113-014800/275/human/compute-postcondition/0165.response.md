`blue_score` is incremented by 1. The value of `quaffle` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `goal_type` and `entity` are still valid as per the initial state.

Output State: **`goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`; the value of `quaffle` is in the list corresponding to the key `goal_type` in the `goals` dictionary; if `goal_type` is `'RG'`, then the first character of `entity` is not `'B'`, or if `goal_type` is `'BG'`, then the first character of `entity` is not `'R'`; `blue_score` is increased by 1.**
