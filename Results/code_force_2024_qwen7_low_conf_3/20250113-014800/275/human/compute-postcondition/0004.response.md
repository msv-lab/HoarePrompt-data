The code creates a new list called `field` which contains lists of strings split from each line in `data` starting from the second line (index 1) up to `N` times. The original values of `MOD`, `data`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged. After executing the code, the value of `field` will be a list of length `N` where each element is a list of strings representing the elements of each line in `data` from index 1 to `N`.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\); `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters; `N` is the first integer from the first line of `data`; `M` is the second integer from the first line of `data`; `field` is a list of length `N` where each element is a list of strings from `data` starting from the second line.**
