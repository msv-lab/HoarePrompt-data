`bludger` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. Given the initial values, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`. Since the value of `j` is dependent on `M`, we cannot specify a concrete value for `j` without knowing the value of `M`. However, we can represent it as `j` being the next integer after 0 if `M > 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, `bludger` is (0, j)**
