Postcondition: ***`cell` is now `field[i][j + 1]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`. If `cell` is `'.' followed by 'Q'`, then `quaffle` is `(i, j + 1)`. If `cell` is `'.' followed by 'B'`, then `bludger` is `(i, j + 1)`. Otherwise, if `cell` is not `'..'`, then `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (i, j + 1), 'has_quaffle': False}`.***
