Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), `cell` is not '.Q'. If the current value of `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is set to (1, M-1). Otherwise, if the current value of `cell` is not '..' and `cell` is not '.B', `players[cell]` is updated to `{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`.***
