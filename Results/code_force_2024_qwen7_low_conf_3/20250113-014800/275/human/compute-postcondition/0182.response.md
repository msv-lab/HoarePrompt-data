Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The `goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`.
   - Depending on the value of `goal_type` and the first character of `entity`, either `red_score` or `blue_score` is incremented.
   - `quaffle` is set to `(N // 2, M // 2)`.
   - `events` is appended with either `f'{t} RED GOAL'` or `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'` based on the condition satisfied.
   - The loop breaks if there is an enclosing loop or match statement.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each key in the `goals` dictionary.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are keys left in the `goals` dictionary.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Since we are starting a new iteration, we assume that the current `goal_type` has been processed and now we move to the next key in the `goals` dictionary.
   - The `goals` dictionary might now contain fewer keys, but it still needs to contain at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `goals` must still contain at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'` for the loop to continue.
   - `quaffle` remains `(N // 2, M // 2)`.
   - `events` will be updated based on the current `goal_type` and `entity`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`goals` dictionary must contain at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, and `events` is updated based on the current `goal_type` and `entity`**.
