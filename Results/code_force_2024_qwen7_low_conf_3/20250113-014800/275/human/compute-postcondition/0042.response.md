The code `quaffle = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are known:

- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`

Since the exact value of `M` is not specified, we consider both cases:

1. If `M` is 1, then `j` is 1.
2. Otherwise, `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, which means `j` is 0.

Therefore, the variable `quaffle` will be either `(0, 1)` or `(0, 0)` depending on the value of `M`.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, `quaffle` is (0, 1) if `M` is 1, otherwise `quaffle` is (0, 0)**
