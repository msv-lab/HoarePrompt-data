Output State: **`cell` is the value of `field[i][j]` where `j` is `M-1`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `M` remains unchanged, `j` is `M-1`, `quaffle` is a tuple representing the position of the quaffle if the quaffle is present, `bludger` is a tuple representing the position of the bludger if the bludger is present, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value and the value is a dictionary with keys `pos` and `has_quaffle`, `goals['RG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'RG' goal is found, `goals['BG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'BG' goal is found.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over every column `j` from `0` to `M-1`.
- For each cell `field[i][j]`, the following actions are performed:
  - If `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', the position `(i, j)` is added to the respective `goals` list.
  - If `cell` is '.Q', the position `(i, j)` is assigned to `quaffle`.
  - If `cell` is '.B', the position `(i, j)` is assigned to `bludger`.
  - If `cell` is not 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', or '.B' and not '..', it is stored in the `players` dictionary under the key `cell`, with the position `(i, j)` and `has_quaffle` set to `False`.

Since the loop iterates over all columns, the final state of the variables will reflect the last iteration of the loop:
- `cell` will be the value of `field[i][M-1]`.
- `field` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `M` remains unchanged.
- `j` is `M-1`.
- `quaffle` will be the position of the quaffle if present.
- `bludger` will be the position of the bludger if present.
- `players` will contain all players with their positions and `has_quaffle` status.
- `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` will contain all positions where the respective goals are found.
