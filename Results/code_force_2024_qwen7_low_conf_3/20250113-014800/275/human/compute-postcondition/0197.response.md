Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `field` is a list of length `N` where each element is a list of strings from `data` starting from the second line, `T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `actions` is a list of length `T` containing elements from `data` starting from the index `N + 2`, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value and the value is a dictionary with keys `pos` and `has_quaffle`, `goals['RG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'RG' goal is found, `goals['BG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'BG' goal is found, `bludger` is a tuple representing the position of the bludger if the bludger is present, otherwise it is `None`, `red_score` is 0, `blue_score` is 0, `events` is an empty list, `t` is 0. If `command` is 'L', `y` is updated to `y - 1`. If `command` is 'R', `y` is updated to `y + 1`. If `command` is 'C' and the player's position matches the quaffle's position, `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` is updated to `True`; otherwise, `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` remains unchanged. If `command` is neither 'L', 'R', nor 'C', the function does nothing.***
