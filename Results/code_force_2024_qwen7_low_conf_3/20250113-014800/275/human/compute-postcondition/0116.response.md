Postcondition: ***`cell` is now `field[i][j]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `quaffle` remains unchanged. If `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', the players at these cells contain the entry with `{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`, and `goals[cell]` is a list containing `[{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}, (i, j)]. If `cell` is '.Q', the player at this cell has the quaffle. If `cell` is '.B', the bludger is now located at `(i, j)` and the player at this cell has the quaffle. In all other cases, the bludger remains unchanged and the player at this cell has the quaffle as long as `cell` is not `'..'`.***
