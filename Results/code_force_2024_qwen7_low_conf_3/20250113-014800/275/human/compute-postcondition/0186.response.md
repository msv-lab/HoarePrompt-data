`events` is updated by appending the string `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'`. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `t` is used in the appended string, but its exact value is not specified. Therefore, we know that `events` now contains the new event along with any previous events.

Output State: **`goals` dictionary must contain at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, `blue_score` is increased by 1, `events` includes the new entry `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'`.**
