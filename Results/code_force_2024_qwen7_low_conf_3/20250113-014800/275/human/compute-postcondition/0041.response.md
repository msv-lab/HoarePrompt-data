`goals[cell].append((i, j))` adds a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state:

- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters
- `N` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `M` must be greater than 0
- `j` is 1 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`
- `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`

From the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1 (since `M` is not specified to be 1, `j` takes the next integer value which is 1). So, the tuple `(i, j)` to be added to `goals[cell]` is `(0, 1)`. The variable `goals[cell]` now contains this tuple.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[0][1]`, and `goals[cell]` contains the tuple `(0, 1)`**.
