The code appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state, the values of `i`, `j`, and `cell` are known:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is `M-1`
- `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`

The code does not modify `i`, `j`, or `cell` but rather appends a tuple to `goals[cell]`. Since the exact content of `goals` is not given, we only know that the tuple `(1, M-1)` has been added to `goals[cell]`.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`, and `goals[cell]` contains the additional element `(1, M-1)`.**
