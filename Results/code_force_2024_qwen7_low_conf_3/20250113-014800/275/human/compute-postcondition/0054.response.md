`goals[cell]` is appended with a tuple `(i, j)`. Given that `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `i` is 1, and `j` is `M-1`, the value of the tuple being appended is `(1, M-1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is `field[1][M-1]` and is either 'RG' or 'BG', and `goals[cell]` contains the additional element `(1, M-1)`.
