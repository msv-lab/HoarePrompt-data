The code `goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Since the value of `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', the list `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` will receive the tuple `(i, j)`. The variables `field`, `i`, `j`, and `cell` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG'; `field` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; `goals[cell]` contains an additional element `(i, j)`**
