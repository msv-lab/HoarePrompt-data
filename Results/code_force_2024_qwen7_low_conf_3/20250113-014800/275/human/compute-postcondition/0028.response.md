Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is undefined. If `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'), `goals[cell]` contains the tuple (0, j). Otherwise, `cell` is either '.' or '.B'. If `cell` is '.', `quaffle` is `(0, j)`. If `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is `(0, undefined)`. In all cases, `cell` is updated such that `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos'` and `'has_quaffle'` set to `(0, j)` and `False` respectively.***
