Postcondition: ***`cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged. If `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is set to (i, j). Otherwise, if `cell` is '.B', then `bludger` is set to (i, j). Otherwise, `cell` is not equal to '.B', and the value of `cell` is associated with the dictionary `players[cell]` which contains {'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}.***
