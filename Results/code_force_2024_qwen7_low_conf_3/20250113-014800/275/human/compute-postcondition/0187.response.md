Postcondition: ***`goals` dictionary must contain at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, and `events` is updated based on the current goal type and entity. If the entity is 'R', `red_score` is increased by 1, and `events` includes the string `f'{t} RED GOAL'`. Otherwise, `blue_score` is increased by 1, and `events` includes the string `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'`.***
