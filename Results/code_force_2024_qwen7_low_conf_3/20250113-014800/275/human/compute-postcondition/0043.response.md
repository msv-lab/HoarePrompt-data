`bludger` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. The values of `i` and `j` are known from the initial state. Therefore, `bludger` is now a tuple containing `0` and `1` if `M` is `1`, or `0` and the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1` if `M` is greater than `1`.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, `bludger` is `(0, 1)` if `M` is 1, otherwise `(0, j+1)`**
