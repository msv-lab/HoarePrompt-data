`goals[cell].append((i, j))` adds the tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state, `cell` is set to `field[i][j + 1]`. The other variables (`field`, `i`, `quaffle`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`cell` is now `field[i][j + 1]` in `goals[cell]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `quaffle` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`**.
