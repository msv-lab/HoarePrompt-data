`goals[cell].append((i, j))` adds a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state:

- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters
- `N` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `M` must be greater than 0
- `j` is undefined (since it was not initialized before this line)
- `cell` is assigned the value of `field[0][j]`, and its current value is in ('RG', 'BG')

Since `j` is undefined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `cell` is set to one of the values in ('RG', 'BG'). The tuple `(i, j)` is appended to `goals[cell]`.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is undefined, `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'), and `goals[cell]` contains the tuple (0, j)**
