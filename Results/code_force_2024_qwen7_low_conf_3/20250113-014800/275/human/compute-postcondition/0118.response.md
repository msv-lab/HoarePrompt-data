The code assigns the value of `field[i][j + 1]` to `cell`. The previous value of `cell` was `field[i][j]`. Therefore, the new value of `cell` is `field[i][j + 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cell` is now `field[i][j + 1]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `quaffle` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`.**
