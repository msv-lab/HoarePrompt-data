Let's break down the given information and the for loop step by step to determine the required states at the start of the next iteration.

### Given Information at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters
- `N` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1 (indicating the current iteration is the first one, as it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time)
- `M` is greater than 0
- `j` is the last index in the range `0` to `M-1`
- `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`

### Possible States for `cell`:
- If `cell` is in `('RG', 'BG')`, `goals[cell]` is a list containing all coordinates `(i, j)` where `cell` is `'RG'` or `'BG'`.
- If `cell` is `'.Q'`, `quaffle` is `(1, M-1)`.
- If `cell` is `'.'` followed by `'B'`, `bludger` is `(1, M-1)`.
- For any other `cell`, `players[cell]` is a dictionary with the key `'pos'` mapping to `(1, M-1)` and the key `'has_quaffle'` mapping to `False`.
- If `cell` is `'..'`, no change is made to `quaffle` and `players[cell]` remains unchanged.

### The Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(N):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range `0` to `N-1`. Since `i` is currently 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will increment `i` to 2 for the next iteration.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be updated to 2.
- `N` remains the same.
- `M` remains the same.
- `j` remains the same.
- `cell` remains the same.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, we need to update `i` to 2.

State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is the last index in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`.**
