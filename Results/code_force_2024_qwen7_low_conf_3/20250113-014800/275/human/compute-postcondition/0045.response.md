Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, and `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`. If `cell != '..`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition also holds as there is no change in the state due to the absence of an else part.***
