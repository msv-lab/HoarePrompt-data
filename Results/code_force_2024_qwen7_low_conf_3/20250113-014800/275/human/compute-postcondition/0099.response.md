`bludger` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. The values of `i`, `j`, `cell`, `field`, and `bludger` were initially set, and now `bludger` is updated to hold the values of `i` and `j` in a tuple. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cell` is the value of `.B`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, `bludger` is (i, j), and cell is not in ('RG', 'BG', '.Q')**
