The code `break` does not affect any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no such structure in the given code snippet, the break statement will simply end the current context, which could be a loop or a match case. However, since the context is not specified, we assume it is within a loop.

Given the initial state:
- `goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`
- `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`

The output state remains unchanged because the break statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`; `quaffle` is (N // 2, M // 2)**
