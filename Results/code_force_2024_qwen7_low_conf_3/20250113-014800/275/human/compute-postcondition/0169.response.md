The given code snippet does not affect any variables related to the initial conditions provided. It simply assigns the tuple `(N // 2, M // 2)` to the variable `quaffle`. Since the initial state includes that `goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, and no operations are performed on `red_score`, `blue_score`, `entity`, or `events`, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`; `quaffle` is (N // 2, M // 2)**
