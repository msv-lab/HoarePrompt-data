Postcondition: **`goals` dictionary must contain at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, and `events` is updated based on the current `goal_type` and `entity`. If `quaffle` is found in `goals[goal_type]`, `events` remains unchanged; otherwise, `events` is updated based on the current `goal_type` and `entity` as no other action is specified in the else part.**
