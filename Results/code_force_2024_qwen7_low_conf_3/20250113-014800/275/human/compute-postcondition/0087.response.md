Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]` and has been updated to `field[1][M-1]`. If `cell` is in `('RG', 'BG')`, then `goals[cell]` contains the additional element `(1, M-1)`. Otherwise, if `cell == '.Q'`, `quaffle` is `(1, M-1)`. If `cell == '.B'`, `bludger` is `(1, M-1)`. If `cell != '.Q'` and `cell != '.B'`, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (1, M-1), 'has_quaffle': False}`. If `cell == '..'`, no change is made to `quaffle` and `players[cell]` remains unchanged.***
