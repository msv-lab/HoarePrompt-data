The code appends a string to the list `events`. The string appended is formatted as `'t RED GOAL'`, where `t` is assumed to be the current time or a timestamp which is not specified in the initial state. The value of `red_score` is not modified, and neither is the structure of `goals` or the content of `entity`.

Output State: **`red_score` is 1, `goals` contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, the first character of `entity` is `'R'`, `events` is now a list containing the string `'t RED GOAL'`**
