The code `quaffle = N // 2, M // 2` does not affect any existing variables but updates the value of `quaffle` to `(N // 2, M // 2)`. The states of the other variables (`goals`, `red_score`, `blue_score`, `events`, `entity`, `goal_type`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`goals` dictionary must contain at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, and `events` is updated based on the current `goal_type` and `entity`. If `entity` is 'R' and `goal_type` is 'RG', `red_score` is increased by 1, and `events` includes the string `f'{t} RED GOAL'`. If `entity` is 'B' and `goal_type` is 'BG', `blue_score` is increased by 1, and `events` includes the string `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'`.**
