Postcondition: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]` and has been updated to `field[1][M-1]`. If `cell == '.Q'`, then `quaffle` is `(1, M-1)`. Otherwise, `bludger` is either `(1, M-1)` if `cell == '.B'`, or `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (1, M-1), 'has_quaffle': False}` if `cell != '..'`, or remains unchanged if `cell == '..'`**.
