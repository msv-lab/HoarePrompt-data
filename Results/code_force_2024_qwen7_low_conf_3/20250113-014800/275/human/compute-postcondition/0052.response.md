The code assigns the value of `field[i][j]` to the variable `cell`. Given the initial state:

- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters
- `N` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `M` must be greater than 0
- `j` is `M-1`
- `cell` is the value of `field[0][M-1]`

After executing `cell = field[i][j]`:

- The value of `cell` is updated to `field[i][j]`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `j` remains `M-1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is `field[1][M-1]`**.
