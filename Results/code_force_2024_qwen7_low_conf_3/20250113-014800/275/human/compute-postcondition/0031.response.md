The code appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Initially, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`. The value of `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`. Since the exact value of `field[0][j]` is not provided, let's denote it as `cell_value`.

Here are the steps:

1. `i` is 0.
2. `j` is 0 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`.
3. `cell` is `field[0][j]`.
4. `goals[cell_value]` (where `cell_value` is `field[0][j]`) gets the tuple `(0, j)` appended to it.

Since the exact value of `field[0][j]` is not specified, we will keep it as `cell_value`.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is `field[0][j]`, `goals[cell_value]` includes the tuple `(0, j)`**
