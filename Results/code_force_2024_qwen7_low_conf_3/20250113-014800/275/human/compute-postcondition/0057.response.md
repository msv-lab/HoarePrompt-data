The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. Given the initial values, `i` is 1 and `j` is `M-1`. Therefore, `quaffle` will be `(1, M-1)`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), the current value of `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is (1, M-1)**
