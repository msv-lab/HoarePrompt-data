The code `cell = field[i][j]` assigns the value of the element at index `[i][j]` in the `field` list to the variable `cell`. This operation updates the value of `cell` but does not affect the values of `field`, `i`, or `j`.

Output State: **`cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged**
