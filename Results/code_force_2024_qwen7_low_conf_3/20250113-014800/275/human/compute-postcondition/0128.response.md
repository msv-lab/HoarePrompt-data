Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `field` is a list of length `N` where each element is a list of strings from `data` starting from the second line, `T` is an integer from the `(N + 1)`-th line of `data`, `actions` is a list of length `T` containing elements from `data` starting from the index `N + 2`, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value and the value is a dictionary with keys `pos` and `has_quaffle`, `goals['RG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'RG' goal is found, `goals['BG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'BG' goal is found, `bludger` is a tuple representing the position of the bludger if the bludger is present, otherwise it is `None`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over every cell in the `field` grid. After completing all iterations, the following information is captured:
  - The `goals` dictionary will contain lists of positions where the 'RG' and 'BG' goals are found.
  - The `players` dictionary will map each player (identified by a unique identifier) to a dictionary containing their position and whether they have the quaffle.
  - The `quaffle` position will be set to the position of the first cell encountered that is labeled `'.Q'`.
  - The `bludger` position will be set to the position of the first cell encountered that is labeled `'.B'`.
  - If a cell is marked as `'RG'` or `'BG'`, its position is added to the respective list in the `goals` dictionary.
  - Any other cell that is not `'.Q'`, `'.B'`, `'RG'`, or `'BG'` and is not `..'` will have its position recorded in the `players` dictionary under the appropriate key.
