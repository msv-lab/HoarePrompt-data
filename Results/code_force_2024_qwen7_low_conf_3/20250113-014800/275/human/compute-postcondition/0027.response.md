Postcondition: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is undefined, and `cell` is assigned the value of `field[0][j]`. If `cell` is '.', then `quaffle` is `(0, j)`. If `cell` is not equal to '.Q', and `cell` is equal to '.B', then `bludger` is `(0, undefined)`. Otherwise, `cell` is updated such that `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos'` and `'has_quaffle'` set to `(0, j)` and `False` respectively.**
