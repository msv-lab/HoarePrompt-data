The code `red_score += 1` increments the value of `red_score` by 1. Since the initial state includes that the `goals` dictionary contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`, this information remains unchanged. The only affected variable is `red_score`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`goals` contains at least one of the keys `'RG'` or `'BG'`; `red_score` is incremented by 1**
