Postcondition: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`. If `cell` is in (`'RG'`, `'BG'`), then `goals[cell]` contains the tuple `(0, 1)`. If `cell` is `'.'`, then depending on the value of `M` and the character of `cell`, either `quaffle`, `bludger`, or `players[cell]` is set accordingly: 
- If `cell == '.Q'`, `quaffle` is (0, 1) if `M` is 1, otherwise `quaffle` is (0, 0).
- If `cell == '.B'`, `bludger` is `(0, 1)` if `M` is 1, otherwise `bludger` is `(0, j+1)`.
- If `cell` is neither `'.'`, `'RG'`, nor `'BG'`, `players[cell]` is a dictionary with `{'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`.**
