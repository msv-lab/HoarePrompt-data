The code initializes two variables, `red_score` and `blue_score`, both set to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will include the new values of `red_score` and `blue_score` while keeping the rest of the initial state unchanged.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `field` is a list of length `N` where each element is a list of strings from `data` starting from the second line, `T` is an integer from the `(N + 1)`-th line of `data`, `actions` is a list of length `T` containing elements from `data` starting from the index `N + 2`, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value and the value is a dictionary with keys `pos` and `has_quaffle`, `goals['RG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'RG' goal is found, `goals['BG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'BG' goal is found, `bludger` is a tuple representing the position of the bludger if the bludger is present, otherwise it is `None`, `red_score` is 0, `blue_score` is 0.**
