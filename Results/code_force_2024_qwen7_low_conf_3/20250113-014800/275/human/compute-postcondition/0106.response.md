Postcondition: **`cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged. If `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `field[i][j]`'s corresponding `goals` entry contains an additional element `(i, j)`. If `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is set to `(i, j)`. If `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is set to `(i, j)`. Otherwise, `cell` is neither 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', nor '.B', and the value of `cell` is associated with the dictionary `players[cell]` which contains `{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`.**
