Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is the last index in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`. If `cell` is in `('RG', 'BG')`, `goals[cell]` is a list containing all coordinates `(i, j)` where `cell` is `'RG'` or `'BG'`. Otherwise, if `cell` is `'.Q'`, `quaffle` is `(1, M-1)`. If `cell` is `'.'` followed by `'B'`, `bludger` is `(1, M-1)`. For any other `cell`, `players[cell]` is a dictionary with the key `'pos'` mapping to `(1, M-1)` and the key `'has_quaffle'` mapping to `False`. If `cell` is `'..'`, no change is made to `quaffle` and `players[cell]` remains unchanged.**
