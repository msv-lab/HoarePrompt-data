Postcondition: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`, and `bludger` is (1, M-1) if `cell == '.B'`. Otherwise, `players[cell]` is either `{'pos': (1, M-1), 'has_quaffle': False}` if `cell != '..'`, or remains unchanged if `cell == '..'`**
