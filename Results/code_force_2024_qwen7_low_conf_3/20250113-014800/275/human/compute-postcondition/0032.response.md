The code `quaffle = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`.

Since the value of `M` is not specified, we consider both cases:

1. If `M` is 1, then `j` is 0.
2. If `M` is greater than 1, then `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, which would be 1.

Therefore, the value of `quaffle` will be `(0, 0)` if `M` is 1, and `(0, 1)` if `M` is greater than 1.

The states of the other variables (`MOD`, `data`, `N`, `i`, `M`, `j`, and `cell`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, `quaffle` is (0, 0) if `M` is 1, and (0, 1) if `M` is greater than 1**.
