Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `field` is a list of length `N` where each element is a list of strings from `data` starting from the second line, `T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `actions` is a list of length `T` containing elements from `data` starting from the index `N + 2`, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value and the value is a dictionary with keys `pos` and `has_quaffle`, `goals['RG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'RG' goal is found, `goals['BG']` is a list of tuples representing positions where the 'BG' goal is found, `bludger` is a tuple representing the position of the bludger if the bludger is present, otherwise it is `None`, `red_score` is 0, `blue_score` is 0, `events` is an empty list, `t` is 0, and the function does nothing regardless of whether the player with key `entity` has the quaffle or not.***
