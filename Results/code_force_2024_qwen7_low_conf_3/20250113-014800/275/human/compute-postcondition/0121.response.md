The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `bludger`. The values of `i` and `j` are not changed, but `bludger` is now a tuple containing the values of `i` and `j + 1`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cell` is now `field[i][j + 1]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `quaffle` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `bludger` is `(i, j + 1)`**
