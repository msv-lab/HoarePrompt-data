`quaffle` is assigned the value `(i, j)`. Given that `j` is `j + 1`, the value of `j` in the assignment is `j + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `quaffle` is `(i, j + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cell` is now `field[i][j + 1]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `quaffle` is `(i, j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`.**
