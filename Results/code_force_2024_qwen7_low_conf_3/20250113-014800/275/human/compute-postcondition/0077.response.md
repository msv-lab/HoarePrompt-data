Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-2`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-2]`. If `cell` is in `('RG', 'BG')`, then `goals[cell]` is `[ (1, M-2) ]`. If `cell` is `'.Q'`, then `quaffle` is set to `(1, M-2)`. If `cell` is `'.'` followed by `'B'`, then `bludger` is set to `(1, M-2)`. Otherwise, `players[cell]` is either set to `{'pos': (1, M-2), 'has_quaffle': False}` if `cell` is not `'..'`, or the state remains unchanged if `cell` is `'..'`.***
