Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cell` is now `field[i][j]`.
- `field` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `quaffle` remains unchanged.
- If `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', the players at these cells contain the entry with `{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`.
- `goals[cell]` is a list containing `[{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}, (i, j)].
- If `cell` is '.Q', the player at this cell has the quaffle.
- If `cell` is '.B', the bludger is now located at `(i, j)` and the player at this cell has the quaffle.
- In all other cases, the bludger remains unchanged and the player at this cell has the quaffle unless `cell` is `'..'`.

### Loop:
```
for j in range(M):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `M-1`.
- Each iteration processes a column in the `field` starting from the current `i` row.
- The initial state of `j` was the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `cell` remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify the `field` or the `i` value.
- `field` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `quaffle` remains unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `j` becomes `j + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`cell` is now `field[i][j]`, `field` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `quaffle` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next column in the current row (`i`).
