`bludger` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. Given the initial values, `i` is 1 and `j` is `M-1`. Therefore, `bludger` is assigned the tuple `(1, M-1)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`, `bludger` is (1, M-1)**
