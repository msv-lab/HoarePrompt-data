Postcondition: ***`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1 if `M` is 1, otherwise `j` is the next integer in the range `0` to `M-1`, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`. If `cell == '.Q'`, `quaffle` is (0, 1) if `M` is 1, otherwise `quaffle` is (0, 0). If `cell == '.B'`, `bludger` is `(0, 1)` if `M` is 1, otherwise `bludger` is `(0, j+1)`. If `cell != '.Q'` and `cell != '.B'`, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`.***
