Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Given States:**
   - `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
   - `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters
   - `N` is greater than 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `M` is greater than 0
   - `j` is the last index in the range `0` to `M-1`
   - `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`

2. **Loop Information:**
   ```python
   for j in range(M):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `j` is being used to iterate through the range `0` to `M-1`.
   - The initial value of `j` is specified as the last index in the range `0` to `M-1`. This means `j` is currently set to `M-1`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `j in range(M)` must hold true.
   - Since `j` is initialized to `M-1`, we need to ensure that `M-1` is within the valid range of `range(M)`, which includes all integers from `0` to `M-1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to confirm that `j` is indeed `M-1` and that `M` is a positive integer (which is already stated as `M > 0`).
   - The current value of `j` (`M-1`) should be consistent with the loop condition.

6. **Final State:**
   - `MOD` remains \(10^9 + 7\)
   - `data` remains a list of lines from the input split by newline characters
   - `N` remains greater than 0
   - `i` remains 2
   - `M` remains greater than 0
   - `j` is `M-1`
   - `cell` remains equal to `field[1][M-1]`

Since the current state of `j` (`M-1`) aligns with the loop condition, no additional adjustments are necessary beyond confirming that `M` is a positive integer.

**State:**
**`MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `data` is a list of lines from the input split by newline characters, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is `M-1`, `cell` is equal to `field[1][M-1]`**
