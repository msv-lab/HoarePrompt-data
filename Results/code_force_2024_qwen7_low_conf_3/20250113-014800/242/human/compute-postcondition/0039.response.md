The code `group_a = x[:na]` slices the list `x` from the start up to the index `na`. Given that `x` is `[30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5]` and `na` is 3, the slice `x[:3]` will create a new list `group_a` containing the first three elements of `x`, which are `[30, 20, 15]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is [30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5], `n` is 4, `na` is 3, `nb` is 5, `nc` is 3, `group_a` is [30, 20, 15], `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**
