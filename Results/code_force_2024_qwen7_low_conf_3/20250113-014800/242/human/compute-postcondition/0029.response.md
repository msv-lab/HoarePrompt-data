The given code snippet simply prints 'YES', which does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the values of `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `x`, `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`na` is the first integer read from the input, `nb` is the second integer read from the input, `nc` is the third integer read from the input, `x` is a list where the maximum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` is the first element, the middle value (sorted) is the second element, and the minimum is the third element, `group_a` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing the first `na` elements from `x`, `group_b` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na` to `na + nb` from `x`, `group_c` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na + nb` to the end of `x`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`. Additionally, the program prints 'YES'**.
