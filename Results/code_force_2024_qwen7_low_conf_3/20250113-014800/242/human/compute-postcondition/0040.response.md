The code `group_b = x[na:na + nb]` slices the list `x` from index `na` (which is 3) to `na + nb` (which is 8), resulting in the sublist `[10, 5, -5]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is [30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5], `n` is 4, `na` is 3, `nb` is 5, `nc` is 3, `group_a` is [30, 20, 15], `group_b` is [10, 5, -5], `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**
