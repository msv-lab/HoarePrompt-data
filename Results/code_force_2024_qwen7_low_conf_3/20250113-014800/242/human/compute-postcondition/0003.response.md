`x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `x`. The variables `t`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100,000 and is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers, `na` is an integer, `nb` is an integer, `nc` is an integer**
