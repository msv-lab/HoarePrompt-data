`n, na, nb, nc` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the initial value of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000 and is greater than 0, it remains unchanged. The values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers obtained from the split input, and `n` is also an integer obtained from the split input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000 and is greater than 0, `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers obtained from the split input**
