The code sorts the list `x` in reverse order. This means that `x` will be sorted from the largest to the smallest value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's assume the initial values of `x` are given by user input. For example, let's say the initial values are `[10, 5, 20, 30, -5, 15]`. After sorting `x` in reverse order, the list `x` will be `[30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is [30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5], `n` is 4, `na` is 3, `nb` is 5, `nc` is 3, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**
