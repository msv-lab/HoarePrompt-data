`sum_b` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `group_b`. Since `group_b` contains `[10, 5, -5]`, the sum of these elements is `10 + 5 - 5 = 10`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is [30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5], `n` is 4, `na` is 3, `nb` is 5, `nc` is 3, `group_a` is [30, 20, 15], `group_b` is [10, 5, -5], `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 65, `sum_b` is 10, `sum_c` is 0**
