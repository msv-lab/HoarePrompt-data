Postcondition: ***`na` is the first integer read from the input, `nb` is the second integer read from the input, `nc` is the third integer read from the input, `x` is a list where the maximum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` is the first element, the middle value (sorted) is the second element, and the minimum is the third element, `group_a` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing the first `na` elements from `x`, `group_b` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na` to `na + nb` from `x`, `group_c` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na + nb` to the end of `x`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed to the console based on the condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and (sum_c + sum_a > sum_b)` being satisfied.***
