The code `sum_c = sum(group_c)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_c` and assigns it to `sum_c`. Since `group_c` consists of the elements from `x` starting at index `na + nb` and is sorted in descending order, `sum_c` will be the sum of those elements. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `na` is an integer, `nb` is an integer, `nc` is an integer, `group_a` is a list consisting of the first `na` elements from `x` and is sorted in descending order, `group_b` is a list consisting of elements from `x` starting at index `na` up to, but not including, index `na + nb`, and these elements are sorted in descending order, `group_c` is a list consisting of the elements from `x` starting at index `na + nb` and is sorted in descending order, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`.**
