The code `sum_b = sum(group_b)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_b` and assigns it to `sum_b`. Since `group_b` consists of elements from `x` starting at index `na` up to, but not including, index `na + nb`, and `x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, the sum of `group_b` can be calculated based on the elements within this range.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `na` is an integer, `nb` is an integer, `nc` is an integer, `group_a` is a list consisting of the first `na` elements from `x` and is sorted in descending order, `group_b` is a list consisting of elements from `x` starting at index `na` up to, but not including, index `na + nb`, and these elements are sorted in descending order, `group_c` is a list consisting of the elements from `x` starting at index `na + nb` and is sorted in descending order, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`.**
