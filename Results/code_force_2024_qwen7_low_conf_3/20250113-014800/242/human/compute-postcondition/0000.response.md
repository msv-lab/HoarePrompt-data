`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `t` is now an integer obtained from user input. The values of `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`, and the list `x` are not yet defined because they depend on further input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100,000; `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c` are undefined; the list `x` is undefined**
