The code prints the elements of `group_c` joined into a string with spaces in between. However, the `group_c` list is initially empty. Since there is no change to any variable's value and no new values are assigned, the only thing that happens is the printing of an empty list represented as `''`.

Output State: **`x` is [30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5], `n` is 4, `na` is 3, `nb` is 5, `nc` is 3, `group_a` is [30, 20, 15], `group_b` is [10, 5, -5], `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 65, `sum_b` is 10, `sum_c` is 0, and '' is printed to the console.**
