Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) (the size of the list \( x \)), and three integers \( n_a \), \( n_b \), and \( n_c \) which sum up to \( n \). For each test case, it reads a list of integers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) and sorts them in descending order. It then divides the list into three groups: `group_a` of size \( n_a \), `group_b` of size \( n_b \), and `group_c` of size \( n_c \). The function checks if these groups satisfy the triangle inequality conditions: `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`. If the conditions are satisfied for all test cases, the function prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the three groups in separate lines. If any of the conditions fail for any test case, the function prints 'NO'. The function handles up to 100,000 test cases, with each \( n \) ranging from 3 to 200,000, and the sum of all \( n \) values does not exceed 200,000.**
