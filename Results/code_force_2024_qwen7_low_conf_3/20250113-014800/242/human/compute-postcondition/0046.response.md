The code `print(' '.join(map(str, group_a)))` will print the elements of `group_a` separated by a space. Since `group_a` is `[30, 20, 15]`, the output will be "30 20 15". However, this operation does not change any of the variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is [30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5], `n` is 4, `na` is 3, `nb` is 5, `nc` is 3, `group_a` is [30, 20, 15], `group_b` is [10, 5, -5], `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 65, `sum_b` is 10, `sum_c` is 0, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
