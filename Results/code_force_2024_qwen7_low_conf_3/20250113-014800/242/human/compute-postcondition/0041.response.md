`group_c` is assigned the slice of `x` starting from index `na + nb`. Given that `na` is 3 and `nb` is 5, `na + nb` equals 8. However, since the maximum index in `x` is 5 (because the list indices start from 0), the slice `x[8:]` is an empty list. Therefore, `group_c` becomes an empty list.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is [30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5], `n` is 4, `na` is 3, `nb` is 5, `nc` is 3, `group_a` is [30, 20, 15], `group_b` is [10, 5, -5], `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**
