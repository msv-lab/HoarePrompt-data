The code `sum_c = sum(group_c)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_c` and assigns it to `sum_c`. Since `group_c` is an empty list, the sum of its elements is 0. This does not change the values of any other variables.

Output State: **`x` is [30, 20, 15, 10, 5, -5], `n` is 4, `na` is 3, `nb` is 5, `nc` is 3, `group_a` is [30, 20, 15], `group_b` is [10, 5, -5], `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 65, `sum_b` is 10, `sum_c` is 0**
