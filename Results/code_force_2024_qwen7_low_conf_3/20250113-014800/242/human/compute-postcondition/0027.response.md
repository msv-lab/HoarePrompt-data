First, let's break down the initial state and understand the variables involved:

- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers read from input.
- `x` is a list where the maximum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` is the first element, the middle value (sorted) is the second element, and the minimum is the third element.
- `group_a` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing the first `na` elements from `x`.
- `group_b` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na` to `na + nb` from `x`.
- `group_c` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na + nb` to the end of `x`.
- `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`.

Now, let's execute the code snippet `sum_b = sum(group_b)`.

- This line calculates the sum of the elements in `group_b` and assigns it to `sum_b`.
- The values of `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `x`, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` remain unchanged, but `sum_b` is now assigned the sum of the elements in `group_b`.

Output State: **`na` is the first integer read from the input, `nb` is the second integer read from the input, `nc` is the third integer read from the input, `x` is a list where the maximum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` is the first element, the middle value (sorted) is the second element, and the minimum is the third element, `group_a` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing the first `na` elements from `x`, `group_b` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na` to `na + nb` from `x`, `group_c` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na + nb` to the end of `x`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`.**
