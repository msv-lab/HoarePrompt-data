The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function processes data that is implicitly passed through test cases or global state. Given the constraints:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\).
- For each test case:
  - `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, and `n_c` are integers such that \(3 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and \(1 \leq n_a, n_b, n_c \leq n-2\) with \(n_a + n_b + n_c = n\).
  - A list of integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` where each \(1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
  - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.

The function likely processes these test cases and returns some result based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`, and a list of integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`. It returns a result based on the conditions provided for each test case.**
