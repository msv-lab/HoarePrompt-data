Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\), `x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `na` is an integer, `nb` is an integer, `nc` is an integer, `group_a` is a list consisting of the first `na` elements from `x` and is sorted in descending order, `group_b` is a list consisting of elements from `x` starting at index `na` up to, but not including, index `na + nb`, and these elements are sorted in descending order, `group_c` is a list consisting of the elements from `x` starting at index `na + nb` and is sorted in descending order, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`. After all iterations of the loop, if for every iteration `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c` and `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a` and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b` are true, then 'YES' is printed and the groups are printed as specified. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly `t` times.
- Each time the loop runs, it reads new values for `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `x`.
- `x` is sorted in descending order.
- `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are defined based on the values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
- `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the respective groups.
- The condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and sum_c + sum_a > sum_b` is checked each time.
- If the condition is true for all iterations, 'YES' is printed along with the groups.
- If the condition is false even once, 'NO' is printed and no further output is produced.
