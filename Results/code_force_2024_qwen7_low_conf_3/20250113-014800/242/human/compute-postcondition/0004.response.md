`x` is sorted in descending order, which means the elements in `x` are rearranged from the largest to the smallest. The values of `t`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000 and is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `na` is an integer, `nb` is an integer, `nc` is an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000 and is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `na` is an integer, `nb` is an integer, `nc` is an integer**
