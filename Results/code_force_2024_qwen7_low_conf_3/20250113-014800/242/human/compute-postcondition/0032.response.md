The given code prints the elements of `group_c` as a space-separated string. Since `group_c` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na + nb` to the end of `x`, printing this list does not change its contents or the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the output to the console, but the variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`na` is the first integer read from the input, `nb` is the second integer read from the input, `nc` is the third integer read from the input, `x` is a list where the maximum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` is the first element, the middle value (sorted) is the second element, and the minimum is the third element, `group_a` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing the first `na` elements from `x`, `group_b` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na` to `na + nb` from `x`, `group_c` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na + nb` to the end of `x`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
