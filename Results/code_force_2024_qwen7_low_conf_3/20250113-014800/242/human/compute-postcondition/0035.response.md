Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We need to consider the state at the end of the previous iteration of the loop.
   - `na` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `nb` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `nc` is the third integer read from the input.
   - `x` is a list where the maximum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` is the first element, the middle value (sorted) is the second element, and the minimum is the third element.
   - `group_a` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing the first `na` elements from `x`.
   - `group_b` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na` to `na + nb` from `x`.
   - `group_c` is a sorted (in descending order) list containing elements from index `na + nb` to the end of `x`.
   - `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`.
   - `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`.
   - `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`.
   - Either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed to the console based on the condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and (sum_c + sum_a > sum_b)` being satisfied.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `t` iterations. The loop can continue if `t` is greater than the number of iterations already performed.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since we are starting a new iteration of the loop, we need to reset the input values `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
   - We also need to recompute the list `x` based on the new values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
   - The lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` need to be recalculated based on the new `x`.
   - The sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` need to be recalculated based on the new `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
   - Finally, the condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and (sum_c + sum_a > sum_b)` needs to be checked again.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`na` is the first integer read from the input, `nb` is the second integer read from the input, `nc` is the third integer read from the input, `x` is a list where the maximum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` is the first element, the middle value (sorted) is the second element, and the minimum is the third element, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, and the output is not yet determined.**
