Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as specified. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting and Grouping**:
   - The input list `x` is sorted in descending order, which helps in potentially forming larger sums in the first few elements.
   - The list is then divided into three sublists according to the specified sizes (`na`, `nb`, `nc`).
3. **Triangle Inequality Check**:
   - After grouping, the program calculates the sums of the elements in each group.
   - It then checks if the sums satisfy the triangle inequality conditions: `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`.
4. **Output**:
   - If the conditions are met, the program prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the three groups.
   - If any of the conditions are not met, the program prints 'NO'.

Given that the logic implemented matches the problem requirements and constraints, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
