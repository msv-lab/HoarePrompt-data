### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, and ensures that `n_a + n_b + n_c = n`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `x` is sorted in descending order. This is a crucial step because sorting in descending order can help in potentially forming a triangle with the largest elements being part of different groups.

3. **Grouping Elements**:
   - The array `x` is split into three groups based on the indices determined by `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
   - The sums of the elements in these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`) are calculated.

4. **Checking Triangle Inequality**:
   - The program checks if the triangle inequality conditions hold: `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`.
   - If the conditions hold, it prints "YES" followed by the elements in each group.
   - If any of the conditions fail, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles up to 100,000 test cases, with each \( n \) ranging from 3 to 200,000, and the sum of all \( n \) values does not exceed 200,000.
   - The solution considers the constraints and requirements of the problem effectively.

### Evaluation:

- The provided solution correctly reads the input, processes it, and outputs the expected results.
- The logic for sorting the array in descending order and then splitting it into three groups is sound and can indeed help in forming a triangle.
- The triangle inequality conditions are correctly checked, and the output is generated appropriately based on the results of these checks.

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and steps taken in the program. There are no significant issues or errors in the implementation that would invalidate the solution.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
