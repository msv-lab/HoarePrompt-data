You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n positive integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n and three positive
integers n_a, n_b, n_c satisfying n_a+n_b+n_c = n .

You want to split the n positive integers into three groups, so that:

  * The first group contains n_a numbers, the second group contains n_b numbers, the third group contains n_c numbers.
  * Let s_a be the sum of the numbers in the first group, s_b be the sum in the second group, and s_c be the sum in the third group. Then s_a, s_b, s_c are the sides of a triangle with positive area.

Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1\le t\le 100\,000 ) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the t
test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the integers n, n_a, n_b, n_c (3
\leq n \leq 200\,000, 1\leq n_a,n_b,n_c \leq n-2, n_a+n_b+n_c = n ) — the
number of integers to split into three groups, and the desired sizes of the
three groups.

The second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n (1
\leq x_i \leq 10^{9} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed
200\,000 .

Output

For each test case, print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to split the numbers
into three groups satisfying all the conditions. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO}
.

If such a split exists, then describe the three groups as follows.

On the next line, print n_a integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n_a} — the numbers
in the first group.

On the next line, print n_b integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n_b} — the numbers
in the second group.

On the next line, print n_c integers c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n_c} — the numbers
in the third group.

These n_a+n_b+n_c=n integers should be a permutation of x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n
, and they should satisfy the conditions from the statement.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 3 1 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 3
    
    8 1 2 5
    
    16 1 1 1 1 1 1 12

Output

    YES
    1 1 
    1 1 
    1 1 
    NO
    NO
    YES
    16 
    12 1 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, we can put two 1 s into each group: the sum in each
group would be 2 , and there exists a triangle with positive area and sides 2
, 2 , 2 .

In the second and third test cases, it can be shown that there is no such way
to split numbers into groups.

In the fourth test case, we can put number 16 into the first group, with sum
16 , numbers 12 and 1 into the second group, with sum 13 , and the remaining
five 1 s into the third group, with sum 5 , as there exists a triangle with
positive area and sides 16, 13, 5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) (the size of the list \( x \)), and three integers \( n_a \), \( n_b \), and \( n_c \) which sum up to \( n \). For each test case, it reads a list of integers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) and sorts them in descending order. It then divides the list into three groups: `group_a` of size \( n_a \), `group_b` of size \( n_b \), and `group_c` of size \( n_c \). The function checks if these groups satisfy the triangle inequality conditions: `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`. If the conditions are satisfied for all test cases, the function prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the three groups in separate lines. If any of the conditions fail for any test case, the function prints 'NO'. The function handles up to 100,000 test cases, with each \( n \) ranging from 3 to 200,000, and the sum of all \( n \) values does not exceed 200,000.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided solution correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
3. It then reads the array `x` and sorts it in descending order.
4. The array `x` is then split into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) based on the indices determined by `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
5. The sums of the elements in these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`) are calculated.
6. It checks if the triangle inequality holds for the sums of these groups: `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`.
7. If the condition holds, it prints "YES" followed by the elements in each group.
8. If the condition does not hold, it prints "NO".

Given the logic described in the problem, the provided solution attempts to split the array into three groups and check if the resulting sums can form a triangle. The solution seems to handle all the constraints and requirements correctly, including sorting the array in descending order which can help in forming a triangle with a better chance of satisfying the triangle inequality.
