Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the sums of the groups might not satisfy the triangle inequality after sorting and splitting the array. Specifically, the program sorts the array in descending order and then splits it into three groups based on the indices. However, the triangle inequality conditions (`sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`) should be checked using the smallest elements to ensure the sums can form a valid triangle.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Input:
```
4
6 2 2 2
1 1 1 1 1 3
```

Expected output:
```
YES
1 1 
1 1 
1 1 
```

However, the program outputs:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program sorts the array in descending order, and when splitting into groups, it does not ensure that the smallest sums can form a valid triangle. For instance, in the example above, the sorted array `[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is split into `[3, 1]`, `[1, 1]`, and `[1, 1]`. The sums are `4`, `2`, and `2`, respectively, which do not satisfy the triangle inequality `2 + 2 > 4`.

A correct approach would involve checking the triangle inequality conditions using the smallest sums after sorting in ascending order and then splitting the array accordingly.
