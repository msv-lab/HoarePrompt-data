Reasoning:
1. The provided code correctly parses the input data and handles multiple test cases as specified.
2. It sorts the list of integers in descending order before splitting them into three groups. This ensures that larger numbers are considered first when checking the triangle inequality conditions.
3. The groups are created by slicing the sorted list according to the specified sizes (`na`, `nb`, `nc`).
4. The sums of the groups are calculated and checked against the triangle inequality conditions.
5. If the conditions are satisfied, the function prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the three groups in the required format. If not, it prints 'NO'.
6. The code correctly handles all constraints mentioned in the problem statement, including the number of test cases, the size of the lists, and the range of the integers.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as per the given constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
