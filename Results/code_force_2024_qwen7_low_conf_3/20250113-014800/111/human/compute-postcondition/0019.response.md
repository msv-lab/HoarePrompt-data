According to the given for loop, the loop will iterate over `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive. For the loop to execute, the key condition is that `j` must be within this range. The initial values of `i`, `k`, and `n` provided are:

- `i` is 4
- `k` is at least 2
- `n` is a positive integer
- `dp[3][j]` is the cumulative sum of binomial coefficients modulo `MOD` for all `j` from 1 to `n`

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that there are values of `j` that fall within the specified range. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run even once.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is at least 1, as this is the minimum requirement for the loop to start its iteration.

State: **`i` is 4, `k` is at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `dp[3][j]` is the cumulative sum of binomial coefficients modulo `MOD` for all `j` from 1 to `n`**
