The code updates `dp[i][j]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. Given that `i` is initially 3 and `k` is at least 2, and `n` must be at least 1, the value of `i` remains unchanged. However, the values of `dp[3][j]` for each `j` from 1 to `n` are updated based on the values of `dp[2][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1]`.

Since `dp[2][j]` is defined as the cumulative sum of binomial coefficients modulo `MOD` for all `j` from 1 to `n`, the updated values of `dp[3][j]` will depend on these sums.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `k` is at least 2; `n` must be at least 1; `dp[3][j] = (dp[2][j] + dp[2][j - 1]) % MOD` for each `j` from 1 to `n`.**
