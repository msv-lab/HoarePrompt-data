Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over `i` from 2 to `k + 1`. This means the initial value of `i` should be 2, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2500\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size \((k+1) \times (n+1)\) filled with zeros, except for `dp[1][1]` which is set to 1.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(2, k + 1)`, meaning the loop will start with `i = 2` and continue until `i = k`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop starts correctly, we need to set `i` to its starting value, which is 2.
   - We also need to ensure that `k` is at least 2 because the loop starts from 2 and goes up to `k`.

Given this analysis, the required states to adjust for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be 2.
- `k` must be at least 2.

So, the final state after adjustment is:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is at least 2**
