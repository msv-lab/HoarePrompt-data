The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. Since `i` is initially 3, `j` is `j_end + 1`, and the formula does not specify a new value for `j`, we assume `j` remains unchanged. Given the initial state and the formula, we can infer the following:

- `i` is 3.
- `k` is at least 2.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `dp[i][j]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we can represent it as `j_end + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `dp[3][j_end + 1]` is `(dp[2][j_end + 1] + dp[2][j_end]) % MOD`**
