Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 5.
   - `k` is at least 2.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `dp[3][j]` is the cumulative sum of binomial coefficients modulo `MOD` for all `j` from 1 to `n`.
   - `dp[4][j]` is `(dp[3][j] + dp[3][j - 1]) % MOD` for all `j` from 1 to `n`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
   - For each value of `j` in this range, some operations are performed.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n]`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the highest value it has reached.

Given these points, let's determine the states needed for the next iteration:

- Since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, if the loop needs to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- If `j` was the highest value in the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should have:
- `i` remains the same, so `i` is still 5.
- `k` remains at least 2.
- `n` remains at least 1.
- `dp[3][j]` is already calculated for all `j` from 1 to `n`.
- `dp[4][j]` is already calculated for all `j` from 1 to `n`.

The only change is in `j`, which will now be `j + 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 5, `k` is at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `dp[3][j]` is the cumulative sum of binomial coefficients modulo `MOD` for all `j` from 1 to `n`, `dp[4][j]` is (dp[3][j] + dp[3][j - 1]) % `MOD` for all `j` from 1 to `n`, `j` is `j + 1`**
