The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2500 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns the result which is the sum of `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k` modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the sum of `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k` modulo `MOD`.
