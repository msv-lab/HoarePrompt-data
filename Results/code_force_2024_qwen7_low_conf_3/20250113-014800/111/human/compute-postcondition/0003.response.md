According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop starts with `j` being set to 1 (as specified in `range(1, n + 1)`). For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The current states are:
- `i` is 2
- `k` is at least 2

Since `i` and `k` do not affect the loop's execution condition, they do not need to be adjusted. However, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
