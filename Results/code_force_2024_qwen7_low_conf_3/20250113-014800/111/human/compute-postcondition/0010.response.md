According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition is `range(2, k + 1)`, meaning `i` should be less than `k + 1` for the loop to continue executing. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, since `k` is at least 2, it can remain as `at least 2`.

State: **`i` is 3, `k` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, `dp[2][j]` is the cumulative sum of binomial coefficients modulo `MOD` for all `j` from 1 to `n`.**
