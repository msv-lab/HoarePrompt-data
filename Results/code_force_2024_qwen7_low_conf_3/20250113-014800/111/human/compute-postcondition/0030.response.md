Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2500\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\). It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{j}{r}\) for all \(r\) from 0 to \(j\), modulo `MOD`. After populating the `dp` table, the function computes the sum of `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k`, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
1. The function accepts `n` and `k` as input.
2. It initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` with dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)`.
3. It fills the `dp` table using a nested loop, where `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on previous values in the table.
4. It sums up the values `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k`.
5. It returns the computed sum modulo `MOD`.

There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code that need to be explicitly mentioned.
