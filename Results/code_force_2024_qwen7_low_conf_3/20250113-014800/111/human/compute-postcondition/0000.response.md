The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is set to 0. This means that the variable `dp` is now a list of lists filled with zeros. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2500; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `dp` is a 2D list of size (k+1) x (n+1) filled with zeros.**
