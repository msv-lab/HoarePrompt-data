Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `k` is at least 2
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `dp[i][j]` is `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition for `j` is `1 <= j <= n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Since the previous iteration ended with some `j` (let's call it `j_end`), the next value of `j` will be `j_end + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because the loop variable `j` is independent of `i`.
   - `k` remains at least 2.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `dp[i][j]` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

Given that the previous state had `j` at some value `j_end`, the next value of `j` will be `j_end + 1`. For the loop to continue, this new `j` value must still be within the valid range `[1, n + 1]`.

Therefore, the next state will be:
- `i` is 3
- `k` is at least 2
- `n` must be at least 1
- `dp[i][j]` will be updated with the new `j` value, which is `j_end + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j_end` from the previous state, we can generalize that `j` will be incremented by 1.

Final State:
State: **`i` is 3, `k` is at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `dp[i][j]` is `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD` where `j` is `j_end + 1`**.
