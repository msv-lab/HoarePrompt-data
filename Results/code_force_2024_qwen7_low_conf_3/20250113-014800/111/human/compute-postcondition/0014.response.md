The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `j` or `MOD`, we cannot determine the exact value of `dp[i][j]`. However, we know that `dp[i][j]` now holds the value computed from the given formula.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `k`, and `n`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is at least 2, `n` must be at least 1, `dp[i][j]` is `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`**
