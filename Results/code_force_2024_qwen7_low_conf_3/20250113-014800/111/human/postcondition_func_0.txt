The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2500\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\). It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{j}{r}\) for all \(r\) from 0 to \(j\), modulo `MOD`. After populating the `dp` table, the function computes the sum of `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k`, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`.
