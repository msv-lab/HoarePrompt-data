Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`. To verify the correctness of the program, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the expected solution.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary strings of length `i` that contain exactly `j` good substrings.

2. **Base Case**: `dp[1][1] = 1` means there is exactly one way to form a string of length 1 with one good substring (which is "1").

3. **DP Table Filling**:
   - For each length `i` from 2 to `k`, the program updates the DP table based on whether the new character added is '0' or '1'.
   - If the last character is '0', the number of good substrings remains the same as the previous length.
   - If the last character is '1', the number of good substrings increases by 1.

4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is calculated by summing up the values in the DP table for lengths from 1 to `k` and having exactly `n` good substrings.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, it is taken modulo `998244353`.

Given the problem constraints and the approach used, the program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution to count the desired binary strings. The logic for updating the DP table and calculating the final result seems appropriate.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
