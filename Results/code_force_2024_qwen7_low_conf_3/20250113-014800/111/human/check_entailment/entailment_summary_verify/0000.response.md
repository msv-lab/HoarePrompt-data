### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to understand its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to count the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings (each containing exactly one '1') and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized as `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` is supposed to represent the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{j}{r}\) for all \(r\) from 0 to \(j\), modulo `MOD`.
   - This initialization is incorrect because the problem requires counting binary strings with specific properties rather than binomial coefficients.

2. **DP Table Update**:
   - The transition formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD` is applied.
   - This update is intended to count the number of ways to form a binary string with `j` good substrings of length `i`, but it does not correctly enforce the constraint that no good substring can have a length strictly greater than `k`.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result is calculated as the sum of `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k`, and returned modulo `MOD`.
   - This step again does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a combinatorial approach that respects the constraints. The correct way to solve this problem involves generating functions or combinatorial methods that explicitly count the valid binary strings.

Given the provided function summary, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution. Instead, it attempts to use a binomial coefficient-based approach, which is not suitable for this problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The dynamic programming approach used in the code does not respect the constraints of the problem.
