Reasoning:

The program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to solve the problem of counting the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The table `dp` is initialized such that `dp[i][j]` will store the number of ways to form a string of length `j` with exactly `i` good substrings, modulo `MOD`. This is done using the relation `dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD`.

2. **Base Case**: The base case `dp[1][1] = 1` correctly initializes the table because a single character '1' is a good substring by itself.

3. **DP Table Filling**: The nested loops correctly fill the DP table. The outer loop runs from `2` to `k+1` and the inner loop runs from `1` to `n+1`. For each state `dp[i][j]`, the value is computed by adding the previous states `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i-1][j-1]` and taking modulo `MOD`.

4. **Result Calculation**: The result is calculated by summing up the values `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from `1` to `k`, and taking the result modulo `MOD`.

5. **Correct Output**: The function correctly returns the result as required by the problem statement.

Given the structure and implementation, the program correctly solves the problem as per the constraints and requirements provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
