### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem description and the expected solution.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - It then calls the `func_1` function with the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized as a 2D list with dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)`.
   - The base case `dp[1][1] = 1` is set, indicating that there is exactly one way to form a binary string of length 1 with exactly one good substring (which is "1").

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The outer loop iterates over the possible lengths of the prefix from 2 to `k`.
   - The inner loop iterates over the possible number of good substrings from 1 to `n`.
   - The transition formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD` is used to update the DP table.
     - `dp[i-1][j]` accounts for appending a '0' to a string of length `i-1` with `j` good substrings.
     - `dp[i-1][j-1]` accounts for appending a '1' to a string of length `i-1` with `j-1` good substrings, which adds one more good substring.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is calculated by summing up the values in the DP table for all valid lengths `i` from 1 to `k` and having exactly `n` good substrings.
   - The result is taken modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and fits within the specified constraints.

Given the problem constraints and the approach used, the program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution to count the desired binary strings. However, let's carefully validate the DP table filling logic:

- The transition formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD` assumes that adding a '1' to a string of length `i-1` with `j-1` good substrings will always add exactly one good substring. This assumption is correct because a '1' appended to any position in a string of length `i-1` with `j-1` good substrings will create exactly one new good substring.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
