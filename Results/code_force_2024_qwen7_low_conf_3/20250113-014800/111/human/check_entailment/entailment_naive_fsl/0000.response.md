Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are issues with the logic. Specifically, the `dp` table is set up to count the number of binary strings with exactly `j` good substrings of length `i`. However, the transitions in the DP table do not correctly account for the constraint that no good substring can have a length strictly greater than `k`.

For instance, consider the test case `n=4` and `k=2`. The correct answer should be 5, corresponding to the binary strings `0101`, `1010`, `1011`, `1101`, and `1110`. However, the program fails to exclude longer good substrings and does not correctly handle the constraint `k`. The current implementation will include invalid strings like `11110` which has a good substring `111` of length 3, violating the condition.

A corrected approach would involve ensuring that the length of the good substrings does not exceed `k` in the transitions. This requires additional checks or constraints in the DP table updates to enforce the maximum length `k`.
