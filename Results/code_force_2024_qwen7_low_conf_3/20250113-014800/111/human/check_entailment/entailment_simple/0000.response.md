Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - It initializes a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary strings of length `i` that contain exactly `j` good substrings.
   - The base case `dp[1][1] = 1` handles the simplest case: a single '1' is a good substring of length 1.
   - The nested loops fill the `dp` table by considering whether to append '0' or '1' to the existing strings, ensuring that the length of the good substrings does not exceed `k`.

3. **Result Calculation:**
   - After filling the `dp` table, the function sums up the values `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k` and returns the result modulo `998244353`.

### Why the Program Meets the Problem Description:

- **Good Substring Definition:**
  - The program correctly interprets that a substring containing exactly one '1' is considered a good substring.

- **Counting Valid Binary Strings:**
  - The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible binary strings of the required length are considered and that the constraints on the length of good substrings are respected.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The final result is taken modulo `998244353` as specified in the problem statement.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program processes each test case independently and outputs the result for each test case as required.

Given that the program follows the outlined logic and correctly implements the dynamic programming solution, it adheres to the problem description and is thus correct.
