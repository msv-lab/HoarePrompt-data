Reasoning:
- The problem requires counting binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings (each containing exactly one '1') and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.
- The given code uses a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i][j]` is intended to represent the number of ways to form a binary string of length `j` ending with `i-1` ones without exceeding the maximum substring length `k`.
- However, the current implementation of the DP table does not correctly reflect the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the current logic sums up binomial coefficients which do not directly relate to counting valid binary strings with the specified properties.
- The provided execution summary indicates that the function is attempting to construct a DP table but misinterprets what `dp[i][j]` should represent. It should instead be tracking the number of valid binary strings ending at each position `j` with a certain number of '1's, while ensuring no good substring exceeds length `k`.

Given the misunderstanding of the DP approach, the implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
