You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Patrick calls a substring^\dagger of a binary string^\ddagger good if this
substring contains exactly one 1.

Help Patrick count the number of binary strings s such that s contains exactly
n good substrings and has no good substring of length strictly greater than k
. Note that substrings are differentiated by their location in the string, so
if s = 1010 you should count both occurrences of 10.

^\dagger A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b
by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the
beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

^\ddagger A binary string is a string that only contains the characters 0 and
1.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
2500 , 1 \leq k \leq n ) — the number of required good substrings and the
maximum allowed length of a good substring.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2500 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of binary strings s
such that s contains exactly n good substrings and has no good substring of
length strictly greater than k . Since this integer can be too large, output
it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Example

    1 1
    
    3 2
    
    4 2
    
    5 4
    
    6 2
    
    2450 2391

Output

    1
    3
    5
    12
    9
    259280854
    
Note

In the first test case, the only suitable binary string is 1. String 01 is not
suitable because it contains a substring 01 with length 2 > 1 .

In the second test case, suitable binary strings are 011, 110 and 111.

In the third test case, suitable binary strings are 101, 0110, 0111, 1110, and
1111.

# Program:
MOD = 998244353
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[1][1] = 1
    for i in range(2, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD
    result = sum((dp[i][n] for i in range(1, k + 1))) % MOD
    return result





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2500\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\). It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{j}{r}\) for all \(r\) from 0 to \(j\), modulo `MOD`. After populating the `dp` table, the function computes the sum of `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k`, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`.
