### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to count binary strings of length `n` that contain exactly `n` good substrings (each containing exactly one '1') and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`):**
   - The `dp` table is constructed with dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)`.
   - `dp[i][j]` is intended to represent the number of binary strings of length `j` with exactly `i` good substrings of any length, modulo `MOD`.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[1][1] = 1`: There is exactly one way to form a binary string of length 1 with exactly one '1', which is "1".

4. **Transition Logic:**
   - For each `i` from 2 to `k`, we update `dp[i][j]` as the sum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i-1][j-1]` modulo `MOD`.
     - `dp[i-1][j]` considers adding a '0' at the end of a string of length `j-1` with `i-1` good substrings.
     - `dp[i-1][j-1]` considers appending '1' to a string of length `j-1` with `i-1` good substrings.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The result is computed as the sum of `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k` modulo `MOD`.

6. **Annotations and State Transitions:**
   - The annotations indicate that the `dp` table correctly accumulates the counts of binary strings with up to `i` good substrings of length `j`.
   - However, the issue arises when transitioning between states, particularly when considering the constraint that no good substring can be longer than `k`.

7. **Issue with the Current Implementation:**
   - The transition logic `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD` does not inherently enforce the constraint that no good substring can have a length strictly greater than `k`.
   - This means that the current implementation can generate strings with good substrings longer than `k`, which violates the problem constraints.

8. **Corrected Approach:**
   - To enforce the constraint, we need to modify the transition logic to ensure that the length of any good substring does not exceed `k`.
   - One possible approach is to use a different DP table or to incorporate a check within the transitions to ensure that no good substring exceeds `k`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The current implementation does not correctly enforce the constraint that no good substring can have a length strictly greater than `k`. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect due to the lack of proper enforcement of the length constraint `k` in the dynamic programming transitions.
