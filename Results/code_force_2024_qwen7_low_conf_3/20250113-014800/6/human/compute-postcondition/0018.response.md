The code snippet prints the value of `r`. The value of `r` is determined by the condition `if k >= n - 1: r = 1`. Since the value of `r` is set based on the input values of `k` and `n`, the print statement will output the current value of `r`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `r` remains unchanged as `n`, and the value of `r` is printed.**
