The code `print(r)` simply prints the value of `r`. The value of `r` is already determined based on the condition `k >= n - 1`. Since the code does not change the value of `r` or any other variable, the value of `r` remains the same as it was before the print statement.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is an integer from input, `r` is 1 if the condition `k >= n - 1` is true. Otherwise, `r` remains equal to `n`.**
