`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not reference or modify `t`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k`, along with the unchanged value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input**
