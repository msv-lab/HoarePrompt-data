The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `r`. Initially, `r` was equal to `n`. So, after executing `r = 1`, the value of `r` is now `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `t` also remains unchanged because they were not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is an integer from input, `r` is 1**
