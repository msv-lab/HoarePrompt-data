Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is 1, and if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function does not change `r`. Since there is no else part, the value of `r` remains 1 regardless of the condition.***
