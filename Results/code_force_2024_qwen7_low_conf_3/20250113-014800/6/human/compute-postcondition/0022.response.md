The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it processes two integers `n` and `k` that are part of each test case within the function. The constraints are as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\).

The function will return a result based on the given `n` and `k` for each test case. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can only describe the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes two integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\).**
