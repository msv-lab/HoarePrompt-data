Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). Based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( n - 1 \), it sets the variable \( r \) to either 1 or \( n \). Specifically, if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \), \( r \) is set to 1; otherwise, \( r \) is set to \( n \). The function then prints the value of \( r \) for each test case. The function handles up to 1000 test cases, with \( n \) ranging from 1 to 100 and \( k \) ranging from 0 to \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\). Potential edge cases include when \( n \) is 1, in which case \( r \) will always be 1 regardless of \( k \).**
