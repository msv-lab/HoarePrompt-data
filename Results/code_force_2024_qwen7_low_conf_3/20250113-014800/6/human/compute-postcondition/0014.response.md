The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them, converting each to an integer before assigning them to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state of `t` is 1 and it is not affected by this operation, and `r` is determined by the condition `k >= n - 1`, which is not evaluated in the given code, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is 1 if `k >= n - 1` is true, otherwise `r` remains equal to `n`**
