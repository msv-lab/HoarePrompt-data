The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `r`. Initially, `r` is set to `n`, which is an integer from input. After executing `r = 1`, the value of `r` is updated to `1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is 1**
