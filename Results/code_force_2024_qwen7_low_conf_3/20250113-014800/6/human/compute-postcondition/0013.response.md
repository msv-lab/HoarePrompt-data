Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer from input.
   - `r` is 1 if the condition `k >= n - 1` is true; otherwise, `r` remains equal to `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `t` in the range `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the new state after one iteration:**
   - Since `t` is used as the loop variable, the loop will continue until `t` reaches the value of `int(input())`.
   - After the first iteration, `t` will be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `t` will be 1 (if it was 0 initially) plus 1.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - `t` will be set to 1 (since it starts from 0 and is incremented by 1).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `t` must now be 1.
   - `n` remains an integer from input.
   - `r` remains either 1 or `n` based on the condition `k >= n - 1`.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer from input, `r` is 1 if the condition `k >= n - 1` is true, otherwise `r` remains equal to `n`**.
