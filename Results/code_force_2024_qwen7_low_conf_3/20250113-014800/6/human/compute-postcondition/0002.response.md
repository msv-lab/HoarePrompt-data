`r` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is equal to `n`**
