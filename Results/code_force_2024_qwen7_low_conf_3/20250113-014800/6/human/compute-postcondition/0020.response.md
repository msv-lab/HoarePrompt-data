The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables `t`, `n`, and `k` which are constrained as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\). The function's output depends on these variables.

Based on the provided constraints and the implied processing of `t`, `n`, and `k`, the function likely processes these variables to perform some operation and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function processes variables `t`, `n`, and `k` where `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers within the ranges \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), and returns a result based on these variables.**
