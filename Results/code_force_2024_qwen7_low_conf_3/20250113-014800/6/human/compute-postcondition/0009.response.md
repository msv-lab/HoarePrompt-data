The code `r = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `r`. The value of `n` is an integer from input, and the value of `r` is updated to this value. The states of the other variables (`t` and `k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is equal to `n`**
