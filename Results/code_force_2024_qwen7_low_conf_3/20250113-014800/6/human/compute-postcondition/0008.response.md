The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs, splits them, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged because the code does not interact with it. The value of `r` remains 1 since it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` and retains the initial values of `t` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is 1**
