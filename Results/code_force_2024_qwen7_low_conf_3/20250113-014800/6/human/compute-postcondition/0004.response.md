The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `r`. The previous value of `r` was equal to `n`. Since `r` is now explicitly set to 1, its value is no longer dependent on `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `r` is 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1**
