You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        r = n
        if k >= n - 1:
            r = 1
        print(r)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). Based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( n - 1 \), it sets the variable \( r \) to either 1 or \( n \). Specifically, if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \), \( r \) is set to 1; otherwise, \( r \) is set to \( n \). The function then prints the value of \( r \) for each test case. The function handles up to 1000 test cases, with \( n \) ranging from 1 to 100 and \( k \) ranging from 0 to \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\). Potential edge cases include when \( n \) is 1, in which case \( r \) will always be 1 regardless of \( k \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of bridges destroyed (`k`) is less than `n-1`. According to the problem description, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, Everule can only visit 1 island (island 1). However, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than 1 island. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 1`. In this scenario, destroying any single bridge will not isolate any island from island 1. Therefore, Everule can still visit all 4 islands. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1 in this case:

```
Input:
1
4 1

Output:
1
```

The correct output should be 4. This indicates that the program does not handle the case where `k < n-1` correctly.
