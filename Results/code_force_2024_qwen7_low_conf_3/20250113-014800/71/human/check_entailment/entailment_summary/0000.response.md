Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in the input string `s`.
2. It checks if the counts of 'N' and 'S' are equal and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are equal. If these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'.
3. If the conditions are met, it constructs a new string based on the characters in `s`. It ensures that each type of movement ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') is distributed between the rover and the helicopter.
4. The logic for distributing the movements between the rover and the helicopter seems to ensure that each movement is accounted for and that the final positions of the rover and helicopter match.
5. The implementation handles all given constraints and examples in the problem statement correctly.

Based on the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
