You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's imagine the surface of Mars as an infinite coordinate plane. Initially,
the rover Perseverance-2 and the helicopter Ingenuity-2 are located at the
point with coordinates (0, 0) . A set of instructions s consisting of n
instructions of the following types was specially developed for them:

  * N: move one meter north (from point (x, y) to (x, y + 1) ); 
  * S: move one meter south (from point (x, y) to (x, y - 1) ); 
  * E: move one meter east (from point (x, y) to (x + 1, y) ); 
  * W: move one meter west (from point (x, y) to (x - 1, y) ). 

Each instruction must be executed either by the rover or by the helicopter.
Moreover, each device must execute at least one instruction. Your task is to
distribute the instructions in such a way that after executing all n
instructions, the helicopter and the rover end up at the same point, or
determine that this is impossible.

Input

The first line of input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of instructions.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting
of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' — the sequence of instructions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10 ^ 5 .

Output

For each test case, if the required distribution of instructions exists,
output a string p of length n consisting of the characters 'R', 'H'. If the i
-th operation should be executed by the rover, then p_i=\text{R} , if the i
-th operation should be executed by the helicopter, then p_i=\text{H} . If
there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

Otherwise, output NO.

Note

Let's consider the first example: the string S = \texttt{NENSNE} . One of the
possible solutions, shown in the figure below, is p = \texttt{RRHRRH} , using
which both the rover and the helicopter will end up one meter north and one
meter east.

For WWW, the solution is impossible.

    #The program returns a string created by joining the elements in the list 'result', which contains 'R' and 'H' based on the values in 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`.

The function first counts the occurrences of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in the string `s`. It then checks if the counts of 'N' and 'S' are equal and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are equal. If these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'.

If the conditions are met, it constructs a new string based on the characters in `s`. For each 'N' in `s`, it appends 'R' to the result list and decreases the count of 'N'. For each 'S' in `s`, it appends 'H' to the result list and decreases the count of 'S'. Similarly, for each 'E' in `s`, it appends 'R' to the result list and decreases the count of 'E'. For each 'W' in `s`, it appends 'H' to the result list and decreases the count of 'W'. After processing all characters, it returns a string created by joining the elements in the result list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to ensure it meets the requirements outlined in the problem statement. Let's break down the verification process:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input from standard input and splits it into a list `data`. It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the number of north (`N`) and south (`S`) movements are equal, and if the number of east (`E`) and west (`W`) movements are equal.
   - If these conditions are not met, it returns `'NO'`, indicating that it's impossible to distribute the instructions such that both the rover and the helicopter end up at the same point.
   - If the conditions are met, it constructs the result string `result` by assigning each type of movement to either the rover or the helicopter, ensuring each device executes at least one instruction.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and assigns each movement to either 'R' (rover) or 'H' (helicopter), decrementing the counts accordingly. It ensures that each device executes at least one instruction by checking the counts before joining the result list.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1` and appends the result to `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in a newline-separated format.

Given the structure and logic of the code, it appears to follow the requirements of the problem accurately. It correctly handles the distribution of instructions and checks the necessary conditions to ensure both devices end up at the same point or determines that it is impossible.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
