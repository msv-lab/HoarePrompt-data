You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's imagine the surface of Mars as an infinite coordinate plane. Initially,
the rover Perseverance-2 and the helicopter Ingenuity-2 are located at the
point with coordinates (0, 0) . A set of instructions s consisting of n
instructions of the following types was specially developed for them:

  * N: move one meter north (from point (x, y) to (x, y + 1) ); 
  * S: move one meter south (from point (x, y) to (x, y - 1) ); 
  * E: move one meter east (from point (x, y) to (x + 1, y) ); 
  * W: move one meter west (from point (x, y) to (x - 1, y) ). 

Each instruction must be executed either by the rover or by the helicopter.
Moreover, each device must execute at least one instruction. Your task is to
distribute the instructions in such a way that after executing all n
instructions, the helicopter and the rover end up at the same point, or
determine that this is impossible.

Input

The first line of input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of instructions.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting
of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' — the sequence of instructions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10 ^ 5 .

Output

For each test case, if the required distribution of instructions exists,
output a string p of length n consisting of the characters 'R', 'H'. If the i
-th operation should be executed by the rover, then p_i=\text{R} , if the i
-th operation should be executed by the helicopter, then p_i=\text{H} . If
there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

Otherwise, output NO.

    6
    
    NENSNE

    SS
    
    4
    
    EWNN
    
    4
    
    WEWE

Output

    RRHRRH
    NO
    HRRHRH
    NO
    NO
    RHRH
    RRHH
    RH
    RRRH
    RRHH

Note

Let's consider the first example: the string S = \texttt{NENSNE} . One of the
possible solutions, shown in the figure below, is p = \texttt{RRHRRH} , using
which both the rover and the helicopter will end up one meter north and one
meter east.

For WWW, the solution is impossible.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    s = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(n, s))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, s):
    count_north = 0
    count_south = 0
    count_east = 0
    count_west = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == 'N':
            count_north += 1
        elif char == 'S':
            count_south += 1
        elif char == 'E':
            count_east += 1
        else:
            count_west += 1
    if count_north != count_south or count_east != count_west:
        return 'NO'
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i] == 'N' or s[i] == 'S':
            if s[i] == 'N':
                result.append('R')
                count_north -= 1
            else:
                result.append('H')
                count_south -= 1
            i += 1
        elif s[i] == 'E' or s[i] == 'W':
            if s[i] == 'E':
                result.append('R')
                count_east -= 1
            else:
                result.append('H')
                count_west -= 1
            i += 1
    return ''.join(result)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
