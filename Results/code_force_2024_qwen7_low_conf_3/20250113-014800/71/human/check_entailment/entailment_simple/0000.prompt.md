You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's imagine the surface of Mars as an infinite coordinate plane. Initially,
the rover Perseverance-2 and the helicopter Ingenuity-2 are located at the
point with coordinates (0, 0) . A set of instructions s consisting of n
instructions of the following types was specially developed for them:

  * N: move one meter north (from point (x, y) to (x, y + 1) ); 
  * S: move one meter south (from point (x, y) to (x, y - 1) ); 
  * E: move one meter east (from point (x, y) to (x + 1, y) ); 
  * W: move one meter west (from point (x, y) to (x - 1, y) ). 

Each instruction must be executed either by the rover or by the helicopter.
Moreover, each device must execute at least one instruction. Your task is to
distribute the instructions in such a way that after executing all n
instructions, the helicopter and the rover end up at the same point, or
determine that this is impossible.

Input

The first line of input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of instructions.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting
of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' — the sequence of instructions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10 ^ 5 .

Output

For each test case, if the required distribution of instructions exists,
output a string p of length n consisting of the characters 'R', 'H'. If the i
-th operation should be executed by the rover, then p_i=\text{R} , if the i
-th operation should be executed by the helicopter, then p_i=\text{H} . If
there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

Otherwise, output NO.

    NO
    HRRHRH
    NO
    NO
    RHRH
    RRHH
    RH
    RRRH
    RRHH

Note

Let's consider the first example: the string S = \texttt{NENSNE} . One of the
possible solutions, shown in the figure below, is p = \texttt{RRHRRH} , using
which both the rover and the helicopter will end up one meter north and one
meter east.

For WWW, the solution is impossible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    s = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(n, s))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and s is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length n. Additionally, there are t test cases such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    for char in s:
        if char == 'N':
            count_north += 1

        else:
            count_west += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count_north` is the number of 'N' characters in the string `s`, `count_south` is the number of 'S' characters in the string `s`, `count_east` is the number of 'E' characters in the string `s`, `count_west` is the number of 'W' characters in the string `s`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
    if (count_north != count_south or count_east != count_west) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: Postcondition: `count_north` is the number of 'N' characters in the string `s`, `count_south` is the number of 'S' characters in the string `s`, `count_east` is the number of 'E' characters in the string `s`, `count_west` is the number of 'W' characters in the string `s`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Additionally, `count_north == count_south` and `count_east == count_west`.
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i] == 'N' or s[i] == 'S':
            if s[i] == 'N':
                result.append('R')
                count_north -= 1
            else:
                result.append('H')
                count_south -= 1
            i += 1

                count_west -= 1
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `len(s)`, `result` is a list containing 'R' and 'H' based on the values in `s`, `count_north` and `count_south` are equal if all 'N' and 'S' characters were processed, and `count_east` and `count_west` are equal if all 'E' and 'W' characters were processed. If there are remaining 'N' or 'S' characters, `count_north` will be one more than `count_south`, and if there are remaining 'E' or 'W' characters, `count_east` will be one more than `count_west`.
    return ''.join(result)
    #The program returns a string created by joining the elements in the list 'result', which contains 'R' and 'H' based on the values in 's'

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
