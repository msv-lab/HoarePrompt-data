The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`.

The function first counts the occurrences of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in the string `s`. It then checks if the counts of 'N' and 'S' are equal and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are equal. If these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'.

If the conditions are met, it constructs a new string based on the characters in `s`. For each 'N' in `s`, it appends 'R' to the result list and decreases the count of 'N'. For each 'S' in `s`, it appends 'H' to the result list and decreases the count of 'S'. Similarly, for each 'E' in `s`, it appends 'R' to the result list and decreases the count of 'E'. For each 'W' in `s`, it appends 'H' to the result list and decreases the count of 'W'. After processing all characters, it returns a string created by joining the elements in the result list.
