`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not specified in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, and `r` is less than `h`; `rr[0]` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
