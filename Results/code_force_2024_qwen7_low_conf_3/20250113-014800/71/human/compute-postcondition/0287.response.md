`pp` is a list that initially contains either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`. The code appends `'R'` to this list, changing its contents. The other variables are not affected. 

After appending `'R'` to `pp`, the new state of `pp` will be `['H', 'R', 'R']` if it was originally `['H', 'R']`, or `['H', 'H', 'R']` if it was originally `['H', 'H']`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is `r + 1` where `r` is the initial value of `r` and `r < h`.**
