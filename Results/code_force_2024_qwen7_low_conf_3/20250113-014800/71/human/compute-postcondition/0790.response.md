The code `w += 1` increments the value of `w` by 1. Since `w` was previously updated based on the value of `i`, the new value of `w` will be the previous value of `w` plus 1. The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `e`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is updated based on the previous `i`, `s` is updated based on the previous `i`, `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 1, `e` is updated based on the previous `i`**
