`h` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is its previous value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is `h` plus 1, and `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is `h` plus 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` retains its value, `ww` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, and `hh` retains its value.**
