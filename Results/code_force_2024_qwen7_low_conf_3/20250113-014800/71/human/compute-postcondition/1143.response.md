Postcondition: ***`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `r` is 3, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'R'], and `ss` is 0. Depending on the value of `i`, `rr` and `hh` could be updated as follows: 
- If `i` is 'N', then `rr` could be [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0, 0], or [1, 0, 0, 0], and `hh` could be [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0].
- If `i` is 'S', then `rr` is either [-1, 0, 0, 0] and `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], or `rr` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0] and `hh` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 1, 0].***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
