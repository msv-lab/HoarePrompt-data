Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', and `i` is not 'N', 'W', or 'E'. If `(ss)` is true and its value is odd, then `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'. If `(ss)` is true and its value is even, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.***
