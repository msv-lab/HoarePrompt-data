The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined, it is assumed to be created as an empty list before this operation. The values of the other variables (`i`, `rr[2]`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; the value of `rr[2]` is decreased by 1; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is ['R']**
