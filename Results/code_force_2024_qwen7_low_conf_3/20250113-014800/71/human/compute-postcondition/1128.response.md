`pp` is a list containing the value `'R'`. The code snippet appends `'R'` to the list `pp`. Therefore, the updated list `pp` will contain two `'R'` elements. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is `[-1, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is `['R', 'R']`**
