`h` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'N' and the current value of `i` is not 'S', and `r` is greater than or equal to `h`. After executing `h += 1`, the value of `h` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'N' and the current value of `i` is not 'S', `h` is increased by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`**
