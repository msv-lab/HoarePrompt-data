The code appends the character 'R' to the list `pp`. This affects only the variable `pp`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp` is now `pp` with 'R' appended, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1.**
