`ee` is decremented by 1. If `ee` was initially an odd integer, it is now even (since subtracting 1 from an odd number makes it even). Conversely, if `ee` was initially even, it is now odd. 

- If `ee` was initially odd, then `r` was increased by 1 and `pp` was set to `['R']`. After decrementing by 1, `ee` is now even, so `r` remains unchanged and `pp` is no longer relevant.
- If `ee` was initially even, then `h` was incremented by 1 and `pp` was set to `['H']`. After decrementing by 1, `ee` is now odd, so `h` remains unchanged and `pp` is no longer relevant.

In both cases, only one of `r` or `h` is affected, depending on the initial parity of `ee`, and `pp` loses its relevance after the operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `ee` is either even or odd (depending on its initial value), `r` is unchanged if `ee` was initially odd, `h` is unchanged if `ee` was initially even, `pp` is no longer relevant.**
