`w` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 'W', and it is not equal to 'S'. The precondition that `l` is a non-empty string remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', and `w` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `w` is increased by 1**
