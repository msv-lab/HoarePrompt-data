`nn` is decremented by 1. Since the exact initial value of `nn` is not specified, we know that `nn` was initially odd (because if it was even, `r` would have been incremented and `pp` would contain 'H'; if it was odd, `r` would have been incremented and `pp` would contain 'R'). After decrementing `nn` by 1, `nn` becomes even. Therefore, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` now contains 'H'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a string and is not equal to 'E', `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is 'N'; `nn` is even, `r` is incremented by 1 if `nn` was odd initially, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains 'H'.**
