Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Depending on the condition `nn % 2 == 1`, if `nn` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus `['R']`, otherwise `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is `['H']`. If `rr[1]` is true, then `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'` based on the comparison between `r` and `h`, `rr` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.***
