Postcondition: ***`s[i]` is a character, `result` is either `['R']` or `['H']` depending on the value of `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is 'N', `count_north` is decreased by 1. If `s[i]` is 'S', `count_south` is decreased by 1. If `s[i]` is 'E' or 'W', `count_east` and `count_west` are each decremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `count_east` and `count_west` remain unchanged. `i` is increased by 1.***
