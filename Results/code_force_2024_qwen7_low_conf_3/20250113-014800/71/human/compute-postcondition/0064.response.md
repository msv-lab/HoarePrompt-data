`count_north` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `result` is `['R']`, but since `count_north` is not directly related to `result`, the value of `result` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `result` is `['R']`; `count_north` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`result` is `['R']`; `count_north` is decreased by 1.**
