According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `l`. The loop body is omitted, but we know how `i` changes the state based on its value. Let's break down the possible states and conditions:

1. If `i` is 'N', `n` is increased by 1.
2. If `i` is 'S', `s` is the first character of `l` plus 1.
3. If `i` is 'W', `w` is increased by 1.
4. Otherwise (if `i` is any other character), `e` is increased by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `l` is a non-empty string
- `i` is either 'N', 'S', 'W', or any other character
- Depending on the value of `i`, one of the following may have occurred:
  - `n` is increased by 1 if `i` is 'N'
  - `s` is the first character of `l` plus 1 if `i` is 'S'
  - `w` is increased by 1 if `i` is 'W'
  - `e` is increased by 1 otherwise

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be one of the characters in the string `l`.

Let's denote the first character of `l` as `first_char`.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `l` is still a non-empty string (since it will continue to have at least one character)
- `i` will be the next character in the string `l`
- `n` will be updated according to the value of `i` from the previous iteration
- `s` will be the first character of `l` plus 1 if `i` was 'S' from the previous iteration
- `w` will be updated according to the value of `i` from the previous iteration
- `e` will be updated according to the value of `i` from the previous iteration

Since the loop is about to start, `i` will be the next character in `l`, and we need to ensure that the state reflects this transition.

State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is updated according to the previous value of `i` ('N' increases `n` by 1), `s` is updated according to the previous value of `i` ('S' makes `s` the first character of `l` plus 1), `w` is updated according to the previous value of `i` ('W' increases `w` by 1), `e` is updated according to the previous value of `i` (any other character increases `e` by 1)**

To simplify, let's represent the state as:
State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is updated based on the previous `i`, `s` is updated based on the previous `i`, `w` is updated based on the previous `i`, `e` is updated based on the previous `i`**
