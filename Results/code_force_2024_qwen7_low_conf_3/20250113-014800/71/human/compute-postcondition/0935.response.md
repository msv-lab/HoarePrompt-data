`rr[0]` is decremented by 1. Initially, `rr[0]` is `True`, which in Python is equivalent to `1`. After decrementing, `rr[0]` becomes `0`, which is equivalent to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is not equal to 'N'; `rr` is a list where the first element is `0`.**
