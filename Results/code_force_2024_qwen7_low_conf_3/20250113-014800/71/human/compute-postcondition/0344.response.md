`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The original value of `pp` can be either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`. After appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['H', 'R', 'R']` if it was originally `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']` if it was originally `['H', 'H']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is `r + 1`**
