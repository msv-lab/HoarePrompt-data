`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains the previous value plus `'R'`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `rr[2]` is increased by 1.
