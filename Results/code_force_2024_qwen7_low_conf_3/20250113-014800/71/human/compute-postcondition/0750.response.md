The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. All other variables are unaffected by this operation.

- `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string.
- `i` is the first character of the remaining string after `l`.
- `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.
- `rr` is updated by incrementing its second element by 1.
- `r` is increased by 1.

Therefore, the only change is to the list `pp`, which now includes the string `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp` now contains all previous elements plus `'R'`, `ww`, `ee`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `rr` is updated by incrementing its second element by 1, `r` is increased by 1.**
