`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `h` is incremented by 1 (previously stated in the initial state), `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', and `(ww % 2 == 1)` is false. The state of `h`, `l`, and `i` remains unchanged, while `pp` gains the new element `'H'`.

Output State: **`h` is incremented by 1, `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `(ww % 2 == 1)` is false, `pp` is a list containing ['H']**
