Postcondition: ***`i` is a string and not equal to 'E', `a` is a list of integers. If `nn` is true and `nn` is even, then `r` is incremented by 1 if `nn` was odd initially, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains 'H'. If `nn` is false, and `rr[1]` is 0, then `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is `['H']`. If `rr[1]` is not 0 and `r + 1 < h`, then `rr[0]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is `['R']`. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the value `'H'`.***
