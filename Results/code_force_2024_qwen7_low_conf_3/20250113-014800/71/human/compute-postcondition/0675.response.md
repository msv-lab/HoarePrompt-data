`ww` is decremented by 1. The value of `ww` was previously incremented by 1 to become `h` and `r`, and now it is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` are each incremented by 1, `pp` is either `pp` with `'R'` appended or `pp` with `'H'` appended depending on whether `ww` is odd, `ww` is decremented by 1, `ee` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, and `hh` retains its value.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` are each incremented by 1, `pp` is either `pp` with `'R'` appended or `pp` with `'H'` appended depending on whether `ww` is odd, `ww` is decremented by 1, `ee` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, and `hh` retains its value.**
