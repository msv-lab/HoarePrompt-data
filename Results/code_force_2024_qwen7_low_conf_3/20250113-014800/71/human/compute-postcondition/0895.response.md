`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is a string and is not equal to 'E', `a` is a list of integers, the current value of `i` is 'N', and the condition `(nn % 2 == 0)` is true. The state of `nn` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string and is not equal to 'E', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 'N', `nn` is such that `nn % 2 == 0`, and `h` is incremented by 1.**
