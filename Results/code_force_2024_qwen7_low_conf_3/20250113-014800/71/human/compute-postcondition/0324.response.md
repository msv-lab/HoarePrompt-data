The value of `h` is increased by 1. Since `h` was previously increased by either 1 or 2, and now it is increased by 1 more, the new value of `h` can be either its original value plus 2 (if it was originally increased by 1) or its original value plus 3 (if it was originally increased by 2). The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 2 or 3, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `hh[3]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 2 or 3, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `hh[3]` is increased by 1.**
