Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 2 or 3, `pp` can be either `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `['H', 'R', 'H']`, or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`. Additionally, if the else part is executed, `hh[3]` is increased by 1.***
