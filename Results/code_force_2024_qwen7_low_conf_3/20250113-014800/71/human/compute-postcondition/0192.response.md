To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- `l` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is either 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'.
- `r`, `h`, `pp`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` are state variables that may change based on the value of `i`.

Since `i` can be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', we need to consider each case separately:

### Case 1: `i` is 'W'
- `l` remains unchanged.
- If `(ww)` is now even (previously odd):
  - `r` is unchanged.
  - `pp` is 'H'.
  - `h` is increased by 1.
- If `rr[3]` is False and `rr[1]` is False:
  - `r` is increased by 1.
  - `pp` contains ['R'].
- If `rr[3]` is True and `rr[1]` is False:
  - `h` is increased by 1.
  - `pp` is ['H'].
- If `rr[3]` is False and `rr[1]` is True:
  - `r` is increased by 1.
  - `rr[3]` is increased by 1.
  - `h` is greater than `r`.
  - `pp` is ['R'].
- If `r` is greater than or equal to `h`:
  - `hh[2]` is incremented by 1.
  - `h` is incremented by 1.
  - `pp` is still ['H'].

### Case 2: `i` is 'E'
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `r` and `h` may be modified according to the initial value of `ee` and `rr[2]` and `hh[2]`.
  - If `ee` was initially odd:
    - `r` remains unchanged.
  - If `ee` was initially even:
    - `r` and `h` remain unchanged.
  - If `rr[2]` is true:
    - `r` is increased by 1.
    - `pp` is a list containing 'R'.
  - If `hh[2]` is false:
    - `h` is increased by 1.
    - `pp` is a list containing ['H'].
  - If `hh[2]` is true:
    - `r` is incremented by 1.
    - `rr[3]` is increased by 1.
    - `h` is greater than `r`.
    - `pp` is a list containing 'R'.
  - If `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`:
    - `hh` is undefined.
    - `pp` is a list containing 'H'.

### Case 3: `i` is 'N'
- `l` remains unchanged.
- Depending on the initial value of `nn`:
  - `pp` is either ['H'] or ['R'].
  - `r` is either 2 or 1.
  - `h` is either 1 or 1.
- If `rr[1]` is true:
  - `pp` is ['H'].
- If `rr[1]` is false and `r < h`:
  - `r` is incremented by 1.
  - The first element of `rr` is increased by 1.
  - `pp` remains ['R'].
- If `rr[1]` is false and `r >= h`:
  - `h` is incremented by 1.
  - `pp` remains ['H'].

### Case 4: `i` is 'S'
- `l` remains unchanged.
- If `ss` is 0:
  - `h` is incremented by 1.
  - `pp` is ['H'].
  - `ss` remains 0.
- If `rr[0]` is False:
  - `r` is incremented by 1.
  - `pp` contains 'R'.
- If `hh[0]` is False:
  - `pp` is ['H'].
- If `r < h`:
  - `r` is incremented by 1.
  - The second element of `rr` is increased by 1.
  - `pp` contains at least one element which is 'R'.
- If `r >= h`:
  - `h` is incremented by 1.
  - `pp` is set to ['H'].

### Determining the Next State
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the most general case where `i` could be any of 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'.

- `l` remains unchanged.
- `rr[3]` remains false.
- `r` and `h` must be adjusted such that the loop condition allows the next iteration.

Given that `l` is a non-empty string and we need to ensure that the loop can continue, we can assume the simplest case where `i` is 'W' (as it generally increments `h` and sets `pp` to ['H'], which are the most common changes).

Thus, the state adjustments are:
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `h` is increased by 1.
- `pp` is ['H'].
- `rr[3]` remains false.

State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false**.
