The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, we can assume it is a new list created by this operation. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `rr`, and `r`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is 0, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R']**
