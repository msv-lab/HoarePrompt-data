The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The value of `r` was previously derived from the initial state but is now increased by 1. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, `rr[2]`, `hh`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` retains its value from the previous iteration, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` retains its value from the previous iteration, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr[2]` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr[2]` is increased by 1, `hh` retains its value from the previous iteration.**
