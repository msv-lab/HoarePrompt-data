The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `l` being a non-empty string, `i` being equal to 'S', and the condition `(ss % 2 == 0)` being true remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `h` is increased by 1, and `ss` is even.**
