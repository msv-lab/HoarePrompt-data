The value of `h` is incremented by 1, and the other variables retain their values from the previous iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `hh[0]` is incremented by 1.
