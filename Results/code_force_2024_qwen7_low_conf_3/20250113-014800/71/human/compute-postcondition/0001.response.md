The code initializes `count_south` to 0. This does not affect the values of `count_north`, `n`, `s`, or `t`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`count_north` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length n, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `count_south` is 0.**
