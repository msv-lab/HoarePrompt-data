The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The value of `i` does not affect the values of `h` and `pp`, and `r` is already increased by 1. Therefore, the only change is in the list `pp`.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` and `pp` are adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i`; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` contains the elements before execution plus `'R'`**
