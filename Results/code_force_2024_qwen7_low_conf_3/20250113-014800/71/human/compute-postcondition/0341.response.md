`pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Given the initial conditions, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`. In both cases, appending `'H'` will result in `pp` becoming `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`.

The other variables remain unchanged as the code does not affect them directly.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is either 2 or 3, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `hh[1]` is decreased by 1.**
