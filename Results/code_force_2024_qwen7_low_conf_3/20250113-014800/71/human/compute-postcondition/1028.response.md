`pp` is a list to which the string `'R'` is appended. The value of `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', and `r` is increased by 1. The states of `h` and `pp` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`; the states of `h` are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`; the states of `h` are not affected.**
