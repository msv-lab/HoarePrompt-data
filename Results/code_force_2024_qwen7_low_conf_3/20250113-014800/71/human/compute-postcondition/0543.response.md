`pp` is a list that appends the string 'R' to it. The value of `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', 'W', or 'E'. The value of `r` is equal to the previous value of `r` plus 1, and the condition `(ss)` is true with the current value being an odd number. After running the code, `pp` will have the string 'R' appended to it.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `i` is not 'N', 'W', or 'E', `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, `(ss)` is true and its value is odd, `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'**
