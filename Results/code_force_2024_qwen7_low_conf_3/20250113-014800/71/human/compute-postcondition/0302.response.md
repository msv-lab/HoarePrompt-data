`h` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, but since we are incrementing it by exactly 1 now, the updated state for `h` will reflect this change. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1 (from its original value of either 1 or 2), `pp` is either ['H', 'R'] or ['H', 'H'], `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `hh[2]` is incremented by 1.**
