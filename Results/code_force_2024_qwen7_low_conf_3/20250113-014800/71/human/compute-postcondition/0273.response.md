`pp` appends the value `'R'` to the list. Initially, `pp` is `['H']`. After appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['H', 'R']`.

The states of the other variables (`l`, `h`, `rr`, `rr[1]`, `rr[3]`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `rr[1]` is `initial_value + 1`, `rr[3]` is false, `r` is increased by 1**
