`rr[1]` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[1]` is true, which in Python is equivalent to 1. So, after subtracting 1, `rr[1]` will be 0 (which is still considered `True` in a boolean context). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and the condition `nn` is false, and the value of `rr[1]` is 0**
