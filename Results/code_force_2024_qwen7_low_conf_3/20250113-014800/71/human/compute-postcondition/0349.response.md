Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is a list where the first element is 'H' and the second element is 'R' or 'H', depending on the value of `r` relative to `h` and the value of `hh[0]` and `hh[1]`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`. If `hh[1]` is true, it is decreased by 1 in the if part. If `hh[1]` is false, `hh[0]` is increased by 1 if `r >= h` in the else part.***
