The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. The initial state mentions that `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, which means `h` is initially `hh[3]`. Since `h` is incremented by 1, its new value is `hh[3] + 1`. The values of `i` and `pp` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is `hh[3] + 1`; `pp` remains unchanged**
