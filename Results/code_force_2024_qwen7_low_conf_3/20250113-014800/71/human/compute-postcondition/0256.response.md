Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` is false. If `hh[1]` is true, then `pp` is `['H', 'H']`. If `hh[1]` is false, then `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, and `rr[0]` is the initial value of `h` plus 1 if `r` is less than `h`, otherwise `rr[0]` is the initial value of `h` plus 1.***
