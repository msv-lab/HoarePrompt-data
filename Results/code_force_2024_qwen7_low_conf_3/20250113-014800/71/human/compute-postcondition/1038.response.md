`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The initial values of `i` are 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `hh[0]` is 0; `h` is increased by 1 (so `h` is now 1); the states of `pp` adjust accordingly based on the new value of `hh[0]`, which remains 0.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `hh[0]` is 0; `h` is 1; `pp` is ['H']**
