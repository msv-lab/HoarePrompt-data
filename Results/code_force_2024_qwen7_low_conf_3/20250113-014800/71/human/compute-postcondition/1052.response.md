Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. Depending on the value of `i` and the initial state of variables, the following conditions apply:
- If `i` is 'W':
  - If `ww` was even, `ww` becomes odd, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'.
  - If `ww` was odd, `ww` becomes even, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.
  - Additional conditions like `rr[3]` and `hh[3]` affect the updates of `r`, `h`, and `pp` as per the specified logic.
- If `i` is 'E':
  - If `ee` changes from odd to even, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to ['R'].
  - If `ee` changes from even to odd, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to ['H'].
  - Other conditions involving `rr[2]` and `hh[2]` similarly update `r`, `h`, and `pp`.
- If `i` is 'N':
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on `rr[1]`, `hh[1]`, and `r < h`.
  - `pp` is a list containing the previous elements plus 'R' if `i` is 'W' or 'E', or with 'H' if `i` is 'N' or 'S'.
- If `i` is 'S':
  - Conditions affecting `h` and `pp` based on the parity of `ss` and the truth values of `rr[0]` and `hh[0]`.
- If `i` is neither 'W', 'E', 'N', nor 'S', `r` and `h` are updated as per the specified logic, and `pp` is a list containing the previous elements plus 'R' if `i` is 'W' or 'E', or with 'H' if `i` is 'N' or 'S'.***
