`rr[1]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[1]` is not specified, so let's denote it as `initial_value`. After the increment, `rr[1]` will be `initial_value + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[1]` is `initial_value + 1`, `rr[3]` is false**
