`ee` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `ee` is not specified. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is that `ee` is now 1 less than its original value.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is one of `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `['H', 'R', 'H']`, or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `ee` is 1 less than its original value.**
