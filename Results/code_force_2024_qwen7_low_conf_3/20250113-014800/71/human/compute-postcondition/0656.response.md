`r` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `r` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `r` is incremented by 1.**
