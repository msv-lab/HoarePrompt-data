`ee` is decremented by 1. The value of `ee` was either odd or even, so now it will be one less. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is either increased by 1 or 2 depending on whether `ee` is odd or even, `ee` is `ee - 1`, `pp` is either ['H', 'R'] or ['H', 'H'], `rr[3]` is false.
