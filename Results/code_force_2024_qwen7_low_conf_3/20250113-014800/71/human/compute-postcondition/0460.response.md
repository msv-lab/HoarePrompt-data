`r` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `r` was less than `h`, so the new value of `r` is `less than h + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is false, `rr[2]` is `x + 1`, `hh[3]` is false, and `r` is less than `h + 1`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is false, `rr[2]` is `x + 1`, `hh[3]` is false, and `r` is less than `h + 1`**
