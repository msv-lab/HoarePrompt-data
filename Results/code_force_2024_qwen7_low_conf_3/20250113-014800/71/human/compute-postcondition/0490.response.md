The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume it is an empty list before the code is executed. After executing the code, `pp` will contain the single element `'H'`.

The values of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `hh[2]`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is 0, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['H']**
