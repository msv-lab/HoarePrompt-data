Postcondition: ***`count_north` is either 3 or 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n-1` and must have at least one character, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is either 2 or 0, `count_east` is 2 if the current character is 'E', otherwise it remains 1, `count_west` is 2 if the current character is 'W', otherwise it remains 1, `i` is 1 if the next character is 'E', otherwise it is 0, and the current character `char` in the string `s` is the next character in `s`. If the current character is 'N', `count_north` is incremented by 1. If the current character is not 'N', `count_north` remains unchanged and other variables are adjusted according to the else part conditions.***
