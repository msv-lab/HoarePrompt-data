`pp` is a list that has its last element appended with 'H'. The value of `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is the original value plus 1; `pp` remains unchanged except for the new element added. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is the original value plus 1; `pp` is a list with its last element being 'H'.
Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is the original value plus 1; `pp` is a list with its last element being 'H'**
