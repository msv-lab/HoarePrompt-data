Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `pp` can be one of the following: `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `['H', 'R', 'H']`, `['H', 'H', 'H']`, or `['H', 'H', 'R']`. `rr[3]` remains false. `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`. Additionally, if the `else` part is executed, `hh[1]` is increased by 1.**
