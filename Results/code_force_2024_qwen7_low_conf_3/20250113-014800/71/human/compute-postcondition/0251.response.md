`pp.append('R')` adds the string 'R' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` initially contains the element 'H', after appending 'R', `pp` will contain two elements: 'H' and 'R'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `rr[3]` is false, `rr[0]` is 1, `r` is 1**
