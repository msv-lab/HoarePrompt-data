Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `hh[0]` is True, then `h` is `hh[0] + 1`, `r` is ['H'], and `hh[0]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the value `'R'` appended to it. If `r >= h`, then `hh` has its second element incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended.***
