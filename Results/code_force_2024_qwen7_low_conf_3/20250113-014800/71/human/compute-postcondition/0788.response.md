The value of `i` is the next character in `l`, and `n`, `s`, `w`, and `e` are updated based on `i`. The code increments `n` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is updated based on the previous `i` plus 1, `s` is updated based on the previous `i`, `w` is updated based on the previous `i`, `e` is updated based on the previous `i`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is updated based on the previous `i` plus 1, `s` is updated based on the previous `i`, `w` is updated based on the previous `i`, `e` is updated based on the previous `i`**
