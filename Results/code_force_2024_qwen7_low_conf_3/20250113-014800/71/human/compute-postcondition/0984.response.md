`pp` is a list that gets appended with the value 'R'. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `r` is increased by 1; and the states of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `r` is increased by 1; the states of `h` and `pp` are unchanged; `pp` is a list containing 'R'.**
