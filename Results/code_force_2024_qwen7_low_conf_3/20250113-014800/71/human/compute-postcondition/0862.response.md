The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given state, we assume it is a new list created just for this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; a is a list of integers; `ee` is true, and `ee` is not an odd number; `h` is 1; `pp` is ['H']**
