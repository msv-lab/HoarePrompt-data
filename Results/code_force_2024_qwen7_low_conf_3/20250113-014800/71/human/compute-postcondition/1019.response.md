`pp` is a list that is modified by appending the string `'R'`. The value of `i` and the list `rr` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list where the first element is increased by 2; `pp` is a list that includes the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list where the first element is increased by 2; `pp` is a list that includes the element `'R'`**
