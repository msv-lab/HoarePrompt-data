The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be `rr[2]`. Given that `rr[2]` was incremented by 1 in the initial state, the new value of `rr[2]` is now incremented by another 1, making it incremented by 2 in total. The values of `i`, `h`, and `pp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr[2]` is incremented by 2; the values of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged**
