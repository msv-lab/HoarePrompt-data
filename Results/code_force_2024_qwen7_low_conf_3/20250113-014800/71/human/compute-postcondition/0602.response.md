`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined before this operation, it is initially an empty list. After appending `'H'`, `pp` becomes `['H']`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, `hh`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is `h` plus 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is `['H']`, `ww` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, `hh` retains its value.**
