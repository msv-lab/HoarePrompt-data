The value of `h` is incremented by 1, while the values of `l`, `i`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `pp` retains its value from the previous iteration, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` retains its value from the previous iteration, `hh` is the same list with its fourth element incremented by 1.**
