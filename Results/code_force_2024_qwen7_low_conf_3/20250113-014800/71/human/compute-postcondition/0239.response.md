`h` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `h` is its original value plus 1. The states of the other variables (`l`, `pp`, and `rr[3]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1 (i.e., `h` is `h + 1`), `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is `h + 1`, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false**
