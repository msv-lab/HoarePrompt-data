Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E'. If `(ee - 1) % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['R']. If `(ee - 1) % 2 == 0`, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H']. If `rr[2]` is False, then either `rr[3]` is increased by 1 and `pp` is ['R'], or `rr[3]` remains True and `pp` is ['H']. If `rr[2]` is True, the function does not change any variables.***
