The value of `h` is incremented by 1, while the values of `l`, `pp`, and `rr[3]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 2, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 2, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false**
