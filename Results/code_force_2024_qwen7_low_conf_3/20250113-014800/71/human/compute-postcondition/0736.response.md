`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` remains the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
