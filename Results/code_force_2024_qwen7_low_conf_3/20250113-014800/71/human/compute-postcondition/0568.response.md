Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and `i` is not equal to 'W' and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, and `rr[0]` is False. Additionally, if `r` is less than `h`, then `rr[1]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing 'R'. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is increased by 1.**
