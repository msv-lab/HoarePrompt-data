Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is either increased by 1 (if `r < h`) or remains as the original value plus 1 (if `r >= h`), `pp` is either the previous value of `pp` plus `'R'` (if `r < h`) or a list containing the previous value of `pp` followed by `'H'` (if `r >= h`), `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` is a list where the third element is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition, and `hh` is incremented by 1.**
