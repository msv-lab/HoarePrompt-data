`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `r` is one more than its value in the previous iteration, and `pp` is now a list containing the element `'R'`.**
