`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` remains the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and the values of `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
