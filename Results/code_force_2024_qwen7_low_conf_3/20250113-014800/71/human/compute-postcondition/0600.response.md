The code appends 'R' to the list `pp`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` now contains the value `'R'` in addition to whatever it contained before.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing all its previous elements plus 'R'.**
