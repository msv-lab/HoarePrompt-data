The value of `r` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `h`, and `pp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `r` is increased by 1; the states of `h` and `pp` are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `r` is increased by 1; the states of `h` and `pp` are not affected.**
