`pp` is a list to which the string `'R'` is appended. This operation does not affect the values of `l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh`. The only change is that `pp` now contains an additional element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, the value at index 3 of `rr` is incremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'R'` in addition to its previous elements.**
