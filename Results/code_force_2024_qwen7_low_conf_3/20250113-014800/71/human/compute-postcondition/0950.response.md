The value of `h` is incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not 'N', `rr[0]` is False, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `hh[1]` is 1; `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not 'N', `rr[0]` is False, `r` is greater than or equal to `h+1`, `hh[1]` is 1; `h` is increased by 1.**
