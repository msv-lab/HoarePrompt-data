`h` is increased by 1. The initial state shows that `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, but now it is specifically increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state for `h` is that it is increased by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, `hh[3]` is decreased by 1.**
