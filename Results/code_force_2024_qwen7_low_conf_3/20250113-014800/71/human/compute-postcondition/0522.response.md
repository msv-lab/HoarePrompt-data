The value of `hh[1]` is decremented by 1. The initial state is that `hh[1]` is true, so after decrementing by 1, the value of `hh[1]` will be false (since it was initially true and decrementing a boolean value in this context likely means it becomes false). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, the condition `hh[1]` is false**
