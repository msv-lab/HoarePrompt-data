The code `count_south += 1` increments the value of `count_south` by 1. Since `count_south` was initially 1, it will now be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`count_north` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n` and must have at least one character, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is 2, `count_east` is 0, `count_west` is 0, `i` is 1, the current character `char` in the string `s` is 'S'**
