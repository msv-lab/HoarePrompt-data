`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list with three elements, where the second element (rr[1]) is increased by 2; the states of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged, except that `pp` now includes the value `'R'`.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list with three elements, where the second element (rr[1]) is increased by 2; `h` remains unchanged; `pp` is ['R']**
