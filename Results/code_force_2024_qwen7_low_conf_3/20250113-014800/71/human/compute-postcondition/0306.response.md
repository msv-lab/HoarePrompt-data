Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is one of the following: `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `['H', 'R', 'H']`, `['H', 'H', 'H']`, or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is one more than its original value if `r < h`, and `hh[3]` is decreased by 1 if the condition `hh[3]` is true.**
