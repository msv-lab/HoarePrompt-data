`pp` is a list to which the value 'R' is appended. The value at index 3 of `rr` is decreased by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and the value of `i` can be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. After appending 'R' to `pp`, the value of `i`, the value at index 3 of `rr`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is either 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; the value at index 3 of `rr` is decreased by 1; `r` is incremented by 1; `pp` is a list containing 'R'.**
