`ss` is decremented by 1. Initially, `ss` is odd (since the initial state implies `ss` is odd when `r` is 3 and `h` is 1). Decrementing an odd number results in an even number. The values of the other variables (`ww`, `ee`, `rr`, `hh`, `r`, `h`, and `pp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `ss` is 0, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'H']**
