`rr[0]` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[0]` was true, which in Python is equivalent to 1 (or more specifically, non-zero). After decrementing, `rr[0]` becomes 0 (which is equivalent to False). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'N' and the current value of `i` is not 'S', `rr[0]` is False**
