Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `ee` is true, `ee` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `r` and `pp` are updated based on the following conditions: if `rr[2]` is true, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is the list `pp` with `'R'` appended to it, and `rr[2]` is reduced by 1. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `r` is set to 0, `pp` is now `['H']`, and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. If `hh[2]` is false and `r < h`, then `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'R'` in addition to its previous elements. If `hh[2]` is false and `r >= h`, then `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is a list with the additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` is incremented by 1.**
