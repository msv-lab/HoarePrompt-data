The value of `e` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0; `m` is an input integer; `l` must be a non-empty string; `n` is 0; `s` is 0; `w` is 0; `e` is 1; `ww` is 0; `ee` is 0; `nn` is 0; `ss` is 0; the character `i` is not equal to 'N', and the character `i` is not equal to 'S', and the character `i` is not equal to 'W'.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0; `m` is an input integer; `l` must be a non-empty string; `n` is 0; `s` is 0; `w` is 0; `e` is 1; `ww` is 0; `ee` is 0; `nn` is 0; `ss` is 0; the character `i` is not equal to 'N', and the character `i` is not equal to 'S', and the character `i` is not equal to 'W'**
