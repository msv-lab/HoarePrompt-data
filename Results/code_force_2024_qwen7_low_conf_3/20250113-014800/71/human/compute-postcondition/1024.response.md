Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. `h` is incremented by 1. `pp` includes the element `'H'`. If `hh[1]` is true, then `i` remains 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. If `hh[1]` is false and `r < h`, then the first element of `rr` is increased by 2, and `pp` includes the element `'R'`. Otherwise, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1.***
