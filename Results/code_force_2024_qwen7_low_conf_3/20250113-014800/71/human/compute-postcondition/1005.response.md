`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of `i`, `h`, and `pp` are not specified in the code snippet. The only change is to the variable `r`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `r`.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `h` and `pp` are adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i`, and `r` is increased by 1.**
