The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. The previous value of `h` was such that `r` was greater than or equal to `h`, and now `h` is increased by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'. `a` is a list of integers. The condition `rr[2]` is false, and the value of `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`. `hh[3]` is increased by 1.
