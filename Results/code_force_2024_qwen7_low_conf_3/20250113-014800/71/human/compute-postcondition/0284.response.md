Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `ss % 2 == 1` or if `r < h`. Additionally, if `rr[1]` is true, `rr[0]` is the initial value of `h` plus 1 if `r` is less than `h`, otherwise `rr[0]` remains unchanged. If `rr[1]` is false, `rr[0]` is the initial value of `h` plus 1. If `i` is not 'E', `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes from both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that all relevant variables (`h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `r`) are accounted for based on the provided conditions.
