Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `nn % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus ['R']. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and the values of `r`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged.***
