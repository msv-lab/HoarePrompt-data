The code `rr[2] += 1` increments the third element (index 2) of the list `rr` by 1. The value of `rr[2]` is updated, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `rr[2]` is increased by 1.**
