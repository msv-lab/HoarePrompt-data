`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The previous values of `l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`, `ww` retains its value, `ee` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, and `hh` retains its value.
