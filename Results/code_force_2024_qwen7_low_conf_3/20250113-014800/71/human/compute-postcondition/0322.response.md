`pp` is a list that originally contains either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`. After appending `'R'` to `pp`, the new value of `pp` will be either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` is 1, and `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` is 1, and `r` is increased by 1.**
