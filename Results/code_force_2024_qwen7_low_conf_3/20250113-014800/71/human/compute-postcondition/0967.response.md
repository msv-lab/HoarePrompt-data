The code snippet `rr[3] -= 1` decrements the value at index 3 of the list `rr` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the specific values of `rr`. Since the initial state does not give us the exact values of `rr`, we can only state that the value at index 3 of `rr` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; the value at index 3 of `rr` is decreased by 1**
