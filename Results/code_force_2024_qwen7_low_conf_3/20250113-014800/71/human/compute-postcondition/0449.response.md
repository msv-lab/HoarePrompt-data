`rr[3]` is decremented by 1. Since `rr[3]` was initially true (which in Python is equivalent to 1), decrementing it by 1 will make it 0 (which is considered False in a boolean context). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, the current value of `i` is 'W', and the condition `ww` is false; `rr[3]` is False**
