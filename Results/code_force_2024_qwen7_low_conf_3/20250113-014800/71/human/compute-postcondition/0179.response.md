`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The value of `l` remains a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'N' and its current value is not 'S', `r` is less than `h` and its new value is `r + 1`, `rr` is a list with at least two elements and the second element of `rr` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'N' and the current value of `i` is not 'S', `r` is less than `h` and the new value of `r` is `r + 1`, `rr` is a list with at least two elements and the second element of `rr` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing at least one element which is `'R'`.
