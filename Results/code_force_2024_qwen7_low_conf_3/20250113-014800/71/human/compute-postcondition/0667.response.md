Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `i == 'E'` and `ee` is true, `ee` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, based on the conditions: 
- If `rr[2]` is true, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'R'` appended, and `rr[2]` is reduced by 1.
- If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `r` is set to 0, `pp` is now `['H']`, and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1.
- If `hh[2]` is false and `r < h`, then `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is updated with `'R'`.
- If `hh[2]` is false and `r >= h`, then `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is updated with `'H'` added, and `hh[3]` is incremented by 1.
If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 1`, then `nn` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus `['R']`. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is `['H']`. If `rr[1]` is true, then both `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'` based on the comparison between `r` and `h`, `rr` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1. If `i != 'N'`, depending on the initial value of `ss`, either `h` is `h + 2` and `pp` is `['R', 'H']` if `ss` was initially odd, or `pp` is `['R']` if `ss` was initially even. Additionally, `r` is incremented by 1 under specific conditions: 
- If `ss` is non-zero, `r` is incremented by 1 if `ss` was initially even and by 1 if `ss` was initially odd.
- If `ss` is zero, `r` is incremented by 1 if `rr[0]` is True and by 1 if `r < h`. In the latter case, `h` is also incremented by 1. `hh`'s second element is incremented by 1 if `hh[0]` is True, and `h` is incremented by 1 in this case.***
