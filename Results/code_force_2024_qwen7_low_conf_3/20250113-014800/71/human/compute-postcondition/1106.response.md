`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The original list `pp` was `['R']`, so after appending `'R'`, the list becomes `['R', 'R']`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, -1, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R', 'R']**
