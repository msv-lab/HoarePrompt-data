The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `hh[2]` was previously `True`, and `hh[3]` was `False`, and `h` was part of `hh`, incrementing `h` will affect `hh[3]` if it was a numerical value. However, since `hh[3]` is explicitly given as `False`, and there's no indication that `h` was a numerical index in `hh`, we'll assume `h` is a numerical value and `hh[3]` remains `False`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `l` is a non-empty string
- `i` is 'W'
- `ww` is false
- The fourth element of `rr` is false
- `hh[3]` is false
- `hh[2]` is `True`
- The relation `r >= h` holds (assuming `r` is a variable, but its value is not given, so we won't make changes to it)

The only change is to `h`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is false, the fourth element of `rr` is false, `hh[3]` is false, `hh[2]` is `True`, `h` is increased by 1, and the relation `r >= h` holds.**
