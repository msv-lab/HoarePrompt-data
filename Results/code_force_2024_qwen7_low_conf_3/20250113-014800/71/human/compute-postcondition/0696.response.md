Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `ee` is odd, `h` and `r` are each increased by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`, `ww` retains its previous value, `ee` retains its previous value, `rr` retains its previous value, and `hh` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list with one additional element 'H', and `r`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.***
