Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` has an additional element `'H'`, and `hh[1]` retains its value. Otherwise, both `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'` based on the comparison between `r` and `h`, `rr` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1.**
