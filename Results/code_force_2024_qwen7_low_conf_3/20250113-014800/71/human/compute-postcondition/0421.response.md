The code `nn, ss = n - s, 0` updates the values of `nn` and `ss`. Initially, `nn` is set to `n - s`, and `ss` is set to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`.
- `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`.
- The condition `n > s` is true.

After executing the code:
- `nn` is updated to `n - s`.
- `ss` is updated to `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `nn` is `n - s`, `ss` is 0, and every character in `l` has been processed.**
