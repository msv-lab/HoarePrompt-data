`h` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is its previous value plus 1. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is its previous value plus 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is its previous value plus 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
