`r` is incremented by 1. The first element of `rr` is decreased by 1 in the previous iteration, so the value of the first element of `rr` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1.**
