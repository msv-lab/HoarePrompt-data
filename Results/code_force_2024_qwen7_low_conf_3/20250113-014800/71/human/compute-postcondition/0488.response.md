The code `hh[2] -= 1` decrements the value at index 2 of the list `hh` by 1. Initially, the value at index 2 is `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in numerical operations. So, after executing the code, the value at index 2 will be `0`.

Since the initial state mentions that `hh[2]` is `True`, and `True` is equivalent to `1`, the value at index 2 is decremented to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is 0**
