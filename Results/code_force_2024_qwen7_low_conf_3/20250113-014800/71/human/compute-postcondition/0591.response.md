The code snippet appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial state specifies that `pp` retains its value from the previous iteration. Therefore, after appending `'R'` to `pp`, the length of `pp` increases by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` retains its value from the previous iteration, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus `'R'`, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr[2]` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr[2]` is increased by 1, `hh` retains its value from the previous iteration.**
