`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The initial values of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is `hh[2] + 1`, `r`, `pp` contains `'H'` as the last element, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
