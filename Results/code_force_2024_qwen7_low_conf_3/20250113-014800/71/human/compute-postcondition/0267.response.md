`pp` appends the string 'R' to the list. Initially, `pp` is ['H']. After appending 'R', `pp` becomes ['H', 'R']. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `rr[0]` is the original value of `rr[0]` - 1, `rr[3]` is false, `r` is increased by 1.
