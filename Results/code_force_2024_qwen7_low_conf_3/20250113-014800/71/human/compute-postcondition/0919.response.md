Postcondition: ***`i` is a string and not equal to 'E'. `a` is a list of integers. If `hh[1]` is 0, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['H']`. Otherwise, if `r + 1 < h`, then `rr[0]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is `['R']`. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the value `'H'`.***
