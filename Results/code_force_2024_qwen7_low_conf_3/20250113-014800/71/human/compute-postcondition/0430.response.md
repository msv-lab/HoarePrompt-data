Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`, `ww` is `w - e` if `w > e` else 0, `ee` is `e - w` if `w > e` else 0, `nn` is 0 if `n <= s` else `n - s`, `ss` is 0 if `n <= s` else `s - n`, and either `nn % 2 == 1` or `ss % 2 == 1` or `ww % 2 == 1` or `ee % 2 == 1`***

This postcondition includes all the variables and their relationships as described in the precondition, and also incorporates the condition specified in the if statement.
