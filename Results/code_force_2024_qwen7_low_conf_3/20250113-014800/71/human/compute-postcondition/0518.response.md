`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `r` was previously `0` (as stated by `rr[1]`), so now `r` is `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, and the value of `rr[1]` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, and the value of `rr[1]` is 1**
