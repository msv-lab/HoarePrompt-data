Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is false, `hh[3]` is false. If `r < h`, then `hh[2]` is `x + 1`, `pp` is ['R'], and `r` is less than `h + 1`. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is `True`, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, and `pp` is a list containing `'H'`.***
