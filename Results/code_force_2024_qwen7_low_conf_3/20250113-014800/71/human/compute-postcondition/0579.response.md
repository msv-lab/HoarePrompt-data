`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the first character of the string `l`, and `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string. The values of `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, and `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `pp` retains its value from the previous iteration, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `hh` retains its value from the previous iteration.**
