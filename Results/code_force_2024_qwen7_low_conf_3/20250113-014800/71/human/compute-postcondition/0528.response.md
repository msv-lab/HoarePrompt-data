The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, and `r` is less than `h`; `rr[0]` is 1, and `r` is now `r + 1`.
