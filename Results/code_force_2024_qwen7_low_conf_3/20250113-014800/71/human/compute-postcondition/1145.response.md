Postcondition: **`ww` is an integer, `ee` is an integer, `rr` is a list of four integers, `hh` is a list of four integers, `r` is an integer, `h` is an integer, `pp` is a list of strings. If `i` is 'W', then:
- If `ww` is 2, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `['R', 'H']`.
- If `ww` is 3 and `rr[3]` is non-zero, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, -1]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, and `pp` is `['R', 'R']`.
- If `ww` is 3 and `hh[3]` is non-zero, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, -1]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `['R', 'H']`.
- If `ww` is 3, `r` is less than `h`, `rr` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, and `pp` is `['R', 'R']`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `['R', 'H']`.

If `i` is not 'W', then:
- If `i` is 'E', `ww` is 3, `ee` is 0, `rr` could be `[0, 0, -1, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `hh` could be `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `r` is 2 or 3, `h` is 2 or 1, `pp` is either `['R', 'H']` or `['R', 'R']`.
- If `i` is 'N', `rr` could be [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0, 0], or [1, 0, 0, 0], and `hh` could be [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0].
- If `i` is 'S', `rr` is either [-1, 0, 0, 0] and `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], or `rr` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0] and `hh` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 1, 0].**
