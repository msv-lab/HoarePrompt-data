`h` is incremented by 1, so the value of `h` changes. The initial state indicates that `h` was already increased by 1, so it is now increased by 1 again. The other variables (`l`, `pp`, and `rr[3]`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 2 (initially increased by 1), `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false**
