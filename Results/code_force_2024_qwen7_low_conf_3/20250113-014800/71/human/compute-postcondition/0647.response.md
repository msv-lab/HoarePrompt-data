Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `ss` is odd, then `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R'], and `hh` retains its previous value. If `ss` is even, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'`, and `r` retains its previous value.***
