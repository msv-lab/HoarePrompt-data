`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is a string and is equal to 'S', `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is not equal to 'N'; `ss` is true, `ss` is odd, `r` is 1 (assuming r was initially 0)**
