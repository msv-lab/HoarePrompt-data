The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. However, the initial state does not specify that `pp` exists, so we assume `pp` is initialized as an empty list before this code runs. After appending `'R'` to `pp`, the list `pp` now contains the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
