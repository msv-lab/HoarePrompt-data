`hh` is updated by incrementing its second element (index 1) by 1. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `hh`'s second element is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `hh[1]` is incremented by 1.**
