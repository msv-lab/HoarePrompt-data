Postcondition: **`i` is a string currently equal to 'E' and not equal to 'W'; `a` is a list of integers; `pp` is either a list containing ['R'] or ['H']; `rr[2]` remains false. If `rr[2]` is false, `r` is compared with `h`: if `r < h`, `rr[3]` is its original value plus 1 and `r` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1` and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.**
