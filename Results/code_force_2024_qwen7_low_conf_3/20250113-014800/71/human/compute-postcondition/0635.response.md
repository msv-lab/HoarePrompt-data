`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` now contains the value it previously had plus `'R'`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `rr[0]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is the list it was before plus `'R'`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `rr[0]` is incremented by 1.**
