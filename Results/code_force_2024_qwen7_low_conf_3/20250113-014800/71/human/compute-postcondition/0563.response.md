The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given initial state, it can be assumed that `pp` is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'` to `pp`, the list `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and `i` is not equal to 'W' and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `rr[0]` is False, `r` is less than `h` + 1, `rr[1]` is `rr[1]_initial + 1`, `pp` is ['R']**
