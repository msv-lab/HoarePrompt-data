Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'N', and 0 otherwise; `s` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'S', and 0 otherwise; `w` is 2 if the next character in `l` is 'W', and 1 otherwise; `e` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'W' or 'N', and 0 otherwise; `ww` is 0; `ee` is 0; `nn` is 0; `ss` is 0; the character `i` is not equal to 'N'. If `i` equals 'W', `w` becomes 2. Otherwise, `w` remains 1 and `e` becomes 1 if the next character in `l` is 'W' or 'N'.***
