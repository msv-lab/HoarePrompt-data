The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. However, there is no initial value or reference given for `r`. Since `r` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was not initialized before this line of code. Thus, `r` is assigned the value of 1 after this operation.

The output state includes the updated value of `r` and the unchanged values of `l` and `i`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is 1**
