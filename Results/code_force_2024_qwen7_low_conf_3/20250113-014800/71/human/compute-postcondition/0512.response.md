The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the provided initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'`, the list `pp` now contains the element `'H'`.

The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, and the condition `nn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', `h` is `h + 1`, and the condition (nn) is false; pp is ['H']**
