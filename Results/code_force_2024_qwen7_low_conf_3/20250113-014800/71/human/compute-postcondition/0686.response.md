`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `hh[2]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the only change is that `h` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1.**
