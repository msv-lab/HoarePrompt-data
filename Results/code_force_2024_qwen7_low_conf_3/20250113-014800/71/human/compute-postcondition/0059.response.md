The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` is `['R']` if `s[1]` is 'E', `['H']` if `s[1]` is 'W', `count_east` is the original value minus 1 if `s[1]` is 'E', `count_west` is `count_east - 1` if `s[1]` is 'W', and `count_north == count_south` remains unchanged.**
