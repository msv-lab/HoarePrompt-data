Postcondition: ***`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 1, 0], `r` is 3 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `pp` is ['R', 'R'] or ['R', 'H']***

Explanation:
- If `r < h` (i.e., 2 < 1), which is false, the else part is executed. In this case, `rr` remains [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0], `r` remains 2, `h` becomes 2, and `pp` becomes ['R', 'H'].
- If `r >= h` (i.e., 2 >= 1), which is true, the if part is executed. In this case, `rr` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0], `hh` remains [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` becomes 3, `h` remains 1, and `pp` becomes ['R', 'R'].

Combining these two scenarios gives the overall postcondition as stated above.
