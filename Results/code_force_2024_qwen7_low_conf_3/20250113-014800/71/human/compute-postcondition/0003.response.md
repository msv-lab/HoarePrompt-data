The code initializes `count_west` to 0. This does not affect the values of `count_north`, `n`, `s`, `t`, `count_south`, or `count_east`. Therefore, the only change is that `count_west` is now set to 0.

Output State: **`count_north` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length n, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `count_south` is 0; `count_east` is 0, `count_west` is 0.**
