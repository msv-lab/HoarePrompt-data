Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`, if `w > e`, then `ww` is `w - e` and `ee` is 0, otherwise `ww` is 0 and `ee` is `e - w`, `nn` is 0 if `n <= s` else `n - s`, `ss` is 0 if `n <= s` else `s - n`.***
