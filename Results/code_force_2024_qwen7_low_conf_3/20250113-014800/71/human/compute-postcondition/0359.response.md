The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` is 1, so after the increment, `r` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either ['H', 'R'] or ['H', 'H'], `rr[0]` is decreased by 1, `r` is 2, and `rr[3]` remains false.**
