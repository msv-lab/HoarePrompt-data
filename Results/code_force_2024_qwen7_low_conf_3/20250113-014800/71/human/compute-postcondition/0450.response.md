`r` is incremented by 1, which means `r` now holds a value one more than its original value. The initial value of `r` is not specified, but it is implied that it was at least 0 before this operation. The conditions and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, the current value of `i` is 'W', and the condition `ww` is false; `r` is increased by 1**
