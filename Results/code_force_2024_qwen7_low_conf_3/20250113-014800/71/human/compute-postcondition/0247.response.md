`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is `hh[1] - 1`, so after the increment, `h` becomes `hh[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is `hh[1]`, `pp` is `['H']`, `rr[3]` is `false`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is `hh[1]`, `pp` is `['H']`, `rr[3]` is `false`**
