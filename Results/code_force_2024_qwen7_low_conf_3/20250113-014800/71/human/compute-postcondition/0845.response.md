The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial state does not specify the contents of `pp`, so after appending `'R'`, `pp` will contain `'R'`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', `State` is a string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is False, `rr[3]` is False, `hh[3]` is False, `r` is less than `h` by 1, `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains 'R'**
