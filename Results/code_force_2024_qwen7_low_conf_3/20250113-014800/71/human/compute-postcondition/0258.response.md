Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` is false. If `nn` is true, then `r` is increased by 1 if `nn % 2 == 1`, otherwise `r` is increased by 1, and `nn` is decreased by 1. If `nn` is false, then `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`. Additionally, if `rr[1]` is true, then `rr[0]` is the initial value of `h` plus 1 if `r` is less than `h`, otherwise `rr[0]` remains unchanged. If `rr[1]` is false, `rr[0]` is the initial value of `h` plus 1.***
