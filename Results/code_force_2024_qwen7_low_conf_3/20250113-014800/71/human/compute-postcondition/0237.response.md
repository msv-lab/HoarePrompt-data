`r` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `r` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false, `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false, `r` is increased by 1**
