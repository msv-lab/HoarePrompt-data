`s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` must be a non-empty string, `n` is 0, `s` is 1, `w` is 0, `e` is 0, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, the character `i` is equal to 'S'.
