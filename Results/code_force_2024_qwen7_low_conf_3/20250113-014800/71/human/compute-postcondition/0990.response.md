`r` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `r` is unknown. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only affects `r`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; the value of `rr[2]` is decreased by 1; `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; the value of `rr[2]` is decreased by 1; `r` is increased by 1**
