Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to 'N'. If `i` is 'S', and `ss` is 0, then `h` is the original value of `h` plus 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `ss` remains 0. Otherwise, if `rr[0]` is False, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`. If `hh[0]` is False, `pp` is ['H']. If `r` is less than `h`, `r` is incremented by 1 and the second element of `rr` is increased by 1, with `pp` containing at least one element which is `'R'`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to ['H']. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only covers the if part scenarios.***
