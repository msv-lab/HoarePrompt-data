`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since no initial value for `pp` was given, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `r`, `h`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', the condition `r < h` is false, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is now a list containing the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', the condition `r < h` is false, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
