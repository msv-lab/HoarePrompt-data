`count_west` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count_west` is 0, so after the increment, `count_west` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count_north` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n` and must have at least one character, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is 0, `count_east` is 0, `i` is 0, the current character `char` in the string `s` is not 'E', and `count_west` is 1.

Output State: **`count_north` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n` and must have at least one character, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is 0, `count_east` is 0, `i` is 0, the current character `char` in the string `s` is not 'E', and `count_west` is 1.**
