`pp` is a list to which the character 'H' is appended. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, and the values of `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from their previous values. 

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list with one additional element 'H', `r`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
