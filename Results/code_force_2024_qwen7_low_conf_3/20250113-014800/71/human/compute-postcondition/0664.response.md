Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. Depending on the initial value of `ss`, either `h` is `h + 2` and `pp` is `['R', 'H']` if `ss` was initially odd, or `pp` is `['R']` if `ss` was initially even. Additionally, `r` is incremented by 1 in certain conditions as detailed below:
- If `ss` is non-zero (`ss` is `ss - 1`), `r` is incremented by 1 if `ss` was initially even and by 1 if `ss` was initially odd.
- If `ss` is zero (no change in `ss`), `r` is incremented by 1 if `rr[0]` is True and by 1 if `r < h`. In the latter case, `h` is also incremented by 1. `hh`'s second element is incremented by 1 if `hh[0]` is True, and `h` is incremented by 1 in this case.**
