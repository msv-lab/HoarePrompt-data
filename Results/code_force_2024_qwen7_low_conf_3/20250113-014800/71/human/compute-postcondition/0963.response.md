`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `i` (which could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S') does not affect the value of `h`. The states of `i`, `h`, and `pp` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is the original value of `h` plus 1; `pp` retains its original state**
