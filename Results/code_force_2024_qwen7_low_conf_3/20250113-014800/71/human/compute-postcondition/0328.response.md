Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1, 2, or 3, `pp` can be one of the following: `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `['H', 'R', 'H']`, `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`. If the if part is executed, `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. If the else part is executed, `hh[3]` is increased by 1.***
