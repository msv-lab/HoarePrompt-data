`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains the value `'R'` in addition to its previous values, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R'], `ww` retains its previous value, `rr` retains its previous value, `hh` retains its previous value**
