`ss` is decremented by 1. The value of `ss` determines the changes in `r` and `pp`. However, the exact value of `ss` is not given, only that it could affect the value of `r` or `h`. We need to consider both cases:

1. If `ss % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`, and the states of `h` are not affected.
2. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.

Since `ss` is now decreased by 1, we need to check the new value of `ss` to determine which case applies. Without knowing the original value of `ss`, we cannot definitively determine whether `ss % 2 == 1` or not. Therefore, we will keep both possibilities:

- If the original `ss` was odd (now even), then `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.
- If the original `ss` was even (now odd), then `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`.

The output state will reflect these conditions.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `ss` is one less than its original value; if the original `ss` was odd (now even), then `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'; if the original `ss` was even (now odd), then `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`**.
