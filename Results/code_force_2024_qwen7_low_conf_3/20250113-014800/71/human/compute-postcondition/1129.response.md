`hh[0]` is decremented by 1. Initially, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, so after decrementing the first element, `hh` becomes `[-1, 0, 0, 0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [-1, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
