Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. If `ww` was initially even, `ww` becomes odd, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`. If `ww` was initially odd, `ww` becomes even, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`. If `rr[3]` is true, `rr[3]` is decreased by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'. If `hh[3]` is true, `hh` is updated to `[hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i` and now includes `'H'`. If none of the above conditions are met, `hh` is updated to `[hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i` and now includes `'H'`.***
