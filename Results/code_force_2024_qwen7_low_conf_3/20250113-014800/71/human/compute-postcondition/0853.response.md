Postcondition: ***`i` is 'W', `State` is a string, `ww` is False. If `rr[3]` is True, then `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is set to ['H']. If `rr[3]` is False and `r` is less than `h` by 1, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains 'R'. If `rr[3]` is False and `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, then `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to ['H'].***
