`pp` is a list that appends the string 'R'. The value of `i` can be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `r` is increased by 1; `rr[1]` is the original value of `rr[1]` - 1. After appending 'R' to `pp`, the values of `i`, `r`, and `rr[1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `r` is increased by 1; `rr[1]` is the original value of `rr[1]` - 1; `pp` is ['R']**
