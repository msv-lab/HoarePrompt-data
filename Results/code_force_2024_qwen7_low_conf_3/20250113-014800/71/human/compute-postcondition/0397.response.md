The value of `w` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `w` was 0. Therefore, the new value of `w` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` must be a non-empty string, `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 1, `e` is 0, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, the character `i` is not equal to 'N', and the character `i` is not equal to 'S'. The current value of `i` is 'W'.**
