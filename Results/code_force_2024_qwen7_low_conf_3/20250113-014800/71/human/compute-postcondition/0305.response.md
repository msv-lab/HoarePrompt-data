Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']`, `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, or `['H', 'R', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `rr[2]` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `r` is one more than its original value if `r < h`. Additionally, `hh[3]` is decreased by 1 if the condition `hh[3]` is true.***
