The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined, it will be created as an empty list and then modified. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `hh[2]`, `r`, `rr[3]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is False, `r` is equal to `h + 1`, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R']**
