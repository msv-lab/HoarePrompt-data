`pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `i` can be one of 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', and `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i`, the specific adjustment of `pp` depends on the value of `i`. However, without knowing the exact current value of `pp`, we can only say that `pp` now includes the new element `'H'`.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `hh` is [hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]; `h` is `h+1`; `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i` and now includes `'H'`.**
