The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Based on the initial state, `r` was part of the list `rr` and its first element was decreased by 1. Since no specific value for `r` was given initially, we assume `r` was one of the elements in `rr`. After the operation, `r` is now `rr[0] + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is `rr[0] + 1`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
