The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. The operation does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'N' and the current value of `i` is not 'S', `h` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, `pp` is ['H']**
