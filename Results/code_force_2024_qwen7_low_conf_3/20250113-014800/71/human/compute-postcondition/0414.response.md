`w` is incremented by 1. The value of `m`, `l`, `n`, `s`, `e`, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remains unchanged from their previous values. The precondition that `t` is greater than or equal to 0 and the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N' also remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0; `m` is an input integer; `l` is a non-empty string; `n` is 2 if the next character in `l` equals 'N' and 1 otherwise; `s` and `w` are updated based on the next character in `l`; `e` is 1 if the next character in `l` is 'W' or 'N', otherwise `e` is 0; `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0; the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N'; `w` is increased by 1.**
