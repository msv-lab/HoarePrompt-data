`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'`, and `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'`, and `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
