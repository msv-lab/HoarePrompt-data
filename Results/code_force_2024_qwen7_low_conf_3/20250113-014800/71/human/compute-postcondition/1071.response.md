The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Initially, `pp` is `['R']`. After appending 'H', `pp` becomes `['R', 'H']`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 1, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'H']**
