`pp.append('R')` appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. Initially, `pp` is `['H']`. After appending 'R', `pp` becomes `['H', 'R']`. The values of the other variables (`l`, `h`, `rr[3]`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `rr[3]` is false, `r` is 1**
