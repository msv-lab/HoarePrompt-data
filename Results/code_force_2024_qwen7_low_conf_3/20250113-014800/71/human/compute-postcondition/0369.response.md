`pp` appends `'H'` to the list, making `pp` either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 2 or 3, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `hh[1]` is increased by 1.**
