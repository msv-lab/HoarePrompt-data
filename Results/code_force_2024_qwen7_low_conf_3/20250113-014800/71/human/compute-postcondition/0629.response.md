`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `pp` now contains the additional value `'R'`.
