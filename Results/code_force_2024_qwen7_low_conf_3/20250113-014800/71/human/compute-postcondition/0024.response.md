Postcondition: **`count_north` is either 2 or 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n-1` and must have at least one character; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `count_south` is either 3 or 1 depending on whether the current character in the string `s` is 'S'; `count_east` is 2 if the current character is 'E', otherwise it remains 1; `count_west` is 2 if the current character is 'W', otherwise it remains 1; `i` is 1 if the next character is 'E', otherwise it is 0.**
