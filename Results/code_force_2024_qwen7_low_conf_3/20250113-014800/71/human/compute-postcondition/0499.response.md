The code appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined, it is assumed to be an empty list before the code execution. After appending 'H', `pp` will contain ['H']. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is False, `hh[3]` is True, `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, and `pp` is ['H'].

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is False, `hh[3]` is True, `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, `pp` is ['H']**
