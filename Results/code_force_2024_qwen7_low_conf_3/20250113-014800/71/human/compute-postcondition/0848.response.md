The value of `h` is incremented by 1, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to 'W', `State` is a string, `ww` is False, `rr[3]` is False, `hh[3]` is False, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, and `h` is increased by 1.
