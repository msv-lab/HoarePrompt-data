Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `rr[0]` is true, then `h` is `rr[0] + 1`, `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`, and other variables retain their previous values. Otherwise, depending on the condition `hh[0]`, either `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'H'` appended, `hh[0]` is decreased by 1, and other variables are updated accordingly; or if `r < h`, then `pp` contains all previous elements plus `'R'`, `rr` is incremented by 1, and `r` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1.***
