`ww` is decremented by 1. Since the condition `(ww % 2 == 1)` was previously true (meaning `ww` was an odd number), after decrementing `ww` by 1, `ww` will now be even. Therefore, the condition `(ww % 2 == 1)` will no longer be true, and the block of code that increases `r` by 1 and sets `pp` to `['R']` will not execute. Instead, `h` will be incremented by 1, and `pp` will remain as `['H']`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is `ww - 1`, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
