Postcondition: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. If `rr[3]` is true, then `rr[3]` is decreased by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'. Otherwise, if `hh[3]` is true, then `hh` is updated to `[hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i` and now includes `'H'`. If none of the above conditions are met, then `hh` is updated to `[hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i` and now includes `'H'`.**
