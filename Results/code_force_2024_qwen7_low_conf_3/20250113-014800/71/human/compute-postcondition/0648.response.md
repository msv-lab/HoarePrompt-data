The initial state is:
- `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string.
- `i` is the first character of the remaining string.
- If `ss` is odd, then `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R'], and `hh` retains its previous value. If `ss` is even, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'`, and `r` retains its previous value.

The code snippet is:
```python
ss -= 1
```

This code decrements the value of `ss` by 1. Let's consider both cases (when `ss` is odd and when `ss` is even) and see how the state changes:

1. **If `ss` was odd before decrementing:**
   - `h` was increased by 1.
   - `r` was increased by 1.
   - `pp` was set to ['R'].
   - After decrementing `ss`, `ss` is now even.
   - So, `h` is increased by 1 (since `h` was already increased by 1, it is now `h + 2`).
   - `pp` becomes `['R', 'H']`.
   - `r` remains unchanged (it was increased by 1).

2. **If `ss` was even before decrementing:**
   - `h` was increased by 1.
   - `pp` was updated to include `'H'`.
   - `r` remained unchanged.
   - After decrementing `ss`, `ss` is now odd.
   - So, `h` is increased by 1 (since `h` was already increased by 1, it is now `h + 2`).
   - `r` is increased by 1.
   - `pp` remains ['R'].

In both cases, `h` is increased by 2 and `ss` is decreased by 1. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `pp`, and `r`) retain their previous values.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `ss` is `ss - 1`, `h` is `h + 2`, `pp` is `['R', 'H']` if `ss` was initially odd, otherwise `pp` is `['R']`, and `r` is `r + 1` if `ss` was initially even, otherwise `r` is `r + 1`.**
