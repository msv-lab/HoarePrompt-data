The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `hh[1]` is decreased by 1, but since `h` is used in the code and not `hh[1]`, we only consider the direct impact of `h += 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is increased by 1**
