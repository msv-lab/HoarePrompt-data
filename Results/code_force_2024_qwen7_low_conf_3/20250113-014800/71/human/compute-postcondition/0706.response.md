`pp` is a list that has its last operation being appending 'R' to it. The other variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp` is the list with one additional element 'R', `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp` is ['R'], `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
