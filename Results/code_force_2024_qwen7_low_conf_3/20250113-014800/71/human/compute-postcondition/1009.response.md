Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` and `pp` are adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i`; `r` is increased by 1; if `nn % 2 == 1`, `pp` contains the elements before execution plus `'R'`. Otherwise, `h` is the original value plus 1 and `pp` is a list with its last element being 'H'.***
