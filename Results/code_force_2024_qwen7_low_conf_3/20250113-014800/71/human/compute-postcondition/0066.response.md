`count_south` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `result` is `['H']`. Since there is no direct relationship between `count_south` and `result`, the value of `result` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `result` is `['H']`; `count_south` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`result` is `['H']`; `count_south` is decreased by 1**
