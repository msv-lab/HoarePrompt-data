Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the last character in `l`, `n` is the count of 'N' characters in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' characters in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' characters in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character (neither 'N', 'S', nor 'W') in `l`, `nn` is `n - s` if `n > s` else `0`, `ss` is `s - n` if `n <= s` else `0`, `ww` is `0`, `ee` is `e - w`, and `(nn % 2 == 1 or ss % 2 == 1 or ww % 2 == 1 or (ee % 2 == 1))` is `False`**
