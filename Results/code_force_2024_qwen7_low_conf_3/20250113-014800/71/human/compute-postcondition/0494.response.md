The value of `r` is incremented by 1, so `r` is now `h + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E' and `i` is not equal to 'W', `hh[2]` is False, `r` is equal to `h + 1`, `rr[3]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E' and `i` is not equal to 'W', `hh[2]` is False, `r` is equal to `h + 1`, `rr[3]` is increased by 1**
