`h` is incremented by 1. Since `h` was increased by either 1 or 2 before this operation, now it will be increased by either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 2 or 3, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `hh[1]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 2 or 3, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `hh[1]` is increased by 1.**
