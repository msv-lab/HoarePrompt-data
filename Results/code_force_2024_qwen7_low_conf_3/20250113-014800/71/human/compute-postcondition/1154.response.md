The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to work with variables `t`, `n`, and `s` which are defined elsewhere in the code or passed through some external means (e.g., through a call to this function). 

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' characters of length `n`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the provided information, the function processes these inputs but the specific operations and return values are not detailed.

Functionality: **The function processes parameters `t`, `n`, and `s` where `t` is a positive integer up to \(10^4\), `n` is a positive integer up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and `s` is a string of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' characters of length `n`.**
