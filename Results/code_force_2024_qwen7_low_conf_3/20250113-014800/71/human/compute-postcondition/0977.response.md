The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hh` is `[hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]`, and the value of `i` could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', which affects the value of `pp`. Since `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i`, the exact value of `pp` depends on the value of `i`.

After the increment operation, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `hh` is [hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]; `h` is `h+1`; `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i`.**
