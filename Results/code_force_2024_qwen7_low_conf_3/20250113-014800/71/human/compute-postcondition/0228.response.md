`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not specified. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. However, `h` was increased by 1 in a previous statement, and `pp` and `rr[3]` maintain their initial values.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is True, `r` is increased by 1**
