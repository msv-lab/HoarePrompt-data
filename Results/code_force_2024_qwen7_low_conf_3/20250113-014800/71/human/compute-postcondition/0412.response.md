The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` was 2 if the next character in `l` equals 'N' and 1 otherwise. Since the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N', the previous value of `n` was 1. Therefore, the new value of `n` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 2, `s` and `w` are updated based on the next character in `l`, `e` is 0, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0, and the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N'**
