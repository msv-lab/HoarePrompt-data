`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is not specified, but since `hh[0]` is False, it implies `h` is likely 0 (though this is inferred, the actual value was not given). After incrementing `h` by 1, the value of `h` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`, and `hh[0]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'N' and the current value of `i` is not 'S', `h` is 1, `hh[0]` is False**
