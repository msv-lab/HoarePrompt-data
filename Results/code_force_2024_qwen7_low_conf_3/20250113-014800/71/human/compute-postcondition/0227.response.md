`rr[3]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `rr[3]` is false, which in Python is equivalent to `False`. Incrementing `False` by 1 results in `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is True.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is True**
