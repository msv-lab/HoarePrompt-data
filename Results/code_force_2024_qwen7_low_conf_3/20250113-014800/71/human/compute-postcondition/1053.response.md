To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the possible values of `i` and how they affect the variables `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, `hh`, `r`, `h`, and `pp`. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the current state:**
   - We need to know the current values of `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, `hh`, `r`, `h`, and `pp`.

2. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - The variable `i` will take the next value from the list `l`.

3. **Update the state based on the next value of `i`:**
   - Depending on the value of `i`, update `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, and `pp` according to the given conditions.

### Example:

Let's assume the current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `ww = 2` (even)
- `ee = 1` (odd)
- `rr = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `hh = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `r = 1`
- `h = 1`
- `pp = ['R']`

### Possible Values of `i`:

1. **If `i` is 'W':**
   - Since `ww` is even, `ww` becomes odd (`ww = 3`).
   - `r` is incremented by 1 (`r = 2`).
   - `pp` is updated to `['R']` (no change since `pp` already contains 'R').

2. **If `i` is 'E':**
   - Since `ee` is odd, it remains odd (no change).
   - `r` is incremented by 1 (`r = 2`).
   - `pp` is updated to `['R']` (no change since `pp` already contains 'R').

3. **If `i` is 'N':**
   - Update `r` and `h` based on `rr[1]` and `hh[1]` (both are 0, so no change).
   - `pp` is updated to `['R']` (no change since `pp` already contains 'R').

4. **If `i` is 'S':**
   - Update `h` and `pp` based on the parity of `ss` and the truth values of `rr[0]` and `hh[0]` (no specific `ss` value provided, so no change).

5. **If `i` is neither 'W', 'E', 'N', nor 'S':**
   - Update `r` and `h` based on the specified logic (no specific logic provided, so no change).
   - `pp` is updated to `['R']` (no change since `pp` already contains 'R').

### Final State:

Assuming `i` is the next value from the list `l`, let's say `i` is 'W':

- `ww` becomes odd (`ww = 3`).
- `r` is incremented by 1 (`r = 2`).
- `pp` remains `['R']`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**.
