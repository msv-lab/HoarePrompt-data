Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1. If `rr[3]` is true, then `h` is increased by 2, `pp` is ['H', 'H'], and `rr[3]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, then `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `rr[3]` is false, and `rr[2]` is 1. If none of the above conditions are met, then `pp` is ['H', 'H'], `rr[3]` is false, and `hh[3]` is false.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts, as well as the initial state specified in the precondition.
