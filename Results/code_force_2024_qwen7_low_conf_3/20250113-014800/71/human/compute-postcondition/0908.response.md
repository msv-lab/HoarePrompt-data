The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The initial state does not specify the value of `pp`, so we assume it is an empty list before the code is executed. After appending `'H'`, `pp` becomes `['H']`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `a` is a list of integers, `hh[1]` is 0, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['H']`**
