Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1. If `ss % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'`. Otherwise, `r` retains its value and `pp` is the original list with 'H' appended, while `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
