The code `count_east += 1` increments the value of `count_east` by 1. Given that `count_east` is initially 1, after this operation, `count_east` will be 2. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `count_north` is either 2 or 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n-1` and must have at least one character; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `count_south` is either 2 or 0; `count_east` is 2; `count_west` is 1 (if the next character is 'W'), otherwise it is 1 (if it was 1 before); `i` is 1 (if the next character is 'E'), otherwise it is 0 (if the next character is 'W'); and the current character `char` in the string `s` is the next character in `s`.
