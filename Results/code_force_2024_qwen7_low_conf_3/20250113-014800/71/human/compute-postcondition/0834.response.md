The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The initial state is that `i` is 'W', `ww` is `False`, and `rr` is a boolean list with its fourth element being `False`. Since `r` is part of the boolean list `rr`, we can update `rr` to reflect this change.

Given that `rr` is initially a boolean list with its fourth element being `False`, after `r += 1`, the fourth element of `rr` will be `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', `ww` is False, `rr` is a boolean list with its fourth element being True**
