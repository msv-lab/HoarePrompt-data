The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was not initialized before this line of code. Therefore, after executing `r += 1`, `r` will be 1 (assuming it was 0 before). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; `a` is a list of integers; the third element of `rr` is False; `r` is 1.**
