The code `pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since no initial value for `pp` is given, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is false, the fourth element of `rr` is false, `h` is the original value plus 1, `hh` has at least four elements with the fourth element being False, `pp` is ['H']**
