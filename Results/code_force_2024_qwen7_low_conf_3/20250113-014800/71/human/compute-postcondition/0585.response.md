`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `ww`, `rr`, `hh`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr` (with its 4th element decremented by 1), and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`.**
