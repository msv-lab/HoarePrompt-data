`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the only variable that has been updated is `h`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `(hh[2])` is false, `h` is increased by 1**
