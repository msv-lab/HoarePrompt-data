`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` are both increased by 1, and `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` are both increased by 1, `pp` is `pp` with `'R'` added to the end, `ww` retains its value, `ee` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, and `hh` retains its value.
