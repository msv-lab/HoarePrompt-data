Postcondition: ***`i` is a string equal to 'S' and `i` is not equal to 'N'. `a` is a list of integers. `h` is incremented by 1. `pp` is a list containing 'H'. `r` is an integer that is either 1 more than its original value or greater than or equal to `h+1` depending on the value of `rr[0]`. If `rr[0]` is True, `rr[1]` is 1 and `pp` is a list containing ['R'] if `r < h`. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is 1, `h` is `h+1`, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'. If `rr[0]` is False, the same conditions apply as above.***
