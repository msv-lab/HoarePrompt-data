Postcondition: ***`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1. If `hh[3]` is non-zero, then `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, -1]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `['R', 'H']`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, then `rr` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, and `pp` is `['R', 'R']`. If none of the above conditions are met, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `['R', 'H']`.***
