Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`, `ww` is `w - e` if `w > e` else 0, `ee` is `e - w` if `w > e` else 0, `nn` is 0 if `n <= s` else `n - s`, `ss` is 0 if `n <= s` else `s - n`. Either `nn % 2 == 1` or `ss % 2 == 1` or `ww % 2 == 1` or `ee % 2 == 1`, then the string "NO" is printed. Otherwise, `l` is the empty string, `i` is an undefined character, `h` is the final value of `h` after processing all characters in `l`, `r` is the final value of `r` after processing all characters in `l`, if both `h` and `r` are true, the string `pp` is printed. Otherwise, "NO" is printed. The final states of `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, `ss`, `rr`, and `hh` are as described in the else part.***
