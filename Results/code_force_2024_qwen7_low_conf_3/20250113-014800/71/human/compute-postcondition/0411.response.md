Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - \( t \geq 0 \)
   - \( m \) is an input integer
   - \( l \) is a non-empty string
   - \( n = 2 \) if the next character in \( l \) equals 'N', otherwise \( n = 1 \)
   - \( s \) and \( w \) are updated based on the value of \( i \)
     - If \( i = 'S' \), then \( s = 2 \). Otherwise, \( s = 1 \) and \( w = 2 \)
   - \( e = 1 \) if the next character in \( l \) is 'W' or 'N', otherwise \( e = 0 \)
   - \( ww = 0 \)
   - \( ee = 0 \)
   - \( nn = 0 \)
   - \( ss = 0 \)
   - The character \( i \) is not equal to 'N'

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string \( l \).

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's denote the current character processed as \( i \).
   - After processing \( i \), the next character in \( l \) will be the current character being considered for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - \( t \) remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.
   - \( m \) remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.
   - \( l \) is reduced by one character since we have processed one character.
   - \( n \) will be updated based on the next character in \( l \):
     - If the next character in \( l \) is 'N', then \( n = 2 \); otherwise, \( n = 1 \).
   - \( s \) and \( w \) will be updated based on the next character in \( l \):
     - If the next character in \( l \) is 'S', then \( s = 2 \); otherwise, \( s = 1 \) and \( w = 2 \).
   - \( e \) will be updated based on the next character in \( l \):
     - If the next character in \( l \) is 'W' or 'N', then \( e = 1 \); otherwise, \( e = 0 \).
   - \( ww \), \( ee \), \( nn \), and \( ss \) remain 0 since they are not affected by the loop body.
   - The character \( i \) becomes the next character in \( l \), but it is not equal to 'N'.

5. **Final State**:
   - The next character in \( l \) is now the current \( i \).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( l \) must still be non-empty.

Given these points, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 2 if the next character in `l` equals 'N' and 1 otherwise, `s` and `w` are updated based on the next character in `l`, `e` is 1 if the next character in `l` is 'W' or 'N', otherwise `e` is 0, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0, and the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N'**.
