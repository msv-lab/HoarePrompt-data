Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is either the previous value of `pp` plus `'R'` or a list with an additional element `'H'`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Additionally, if `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1.***
