`pp` is a list containing the value 'R'. The code appends 'R' to the list `pp`. Therefore, the list `pp` will now contain two instances of 'R'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, -1, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R', 'R']**
