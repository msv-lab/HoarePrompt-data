`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `nn` is odd, and the other variables (`l`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', `nn` is odd, and `r` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', `nn` is odd, `r` is incremented by 1**
