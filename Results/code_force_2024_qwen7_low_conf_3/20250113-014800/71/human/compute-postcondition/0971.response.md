`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is not specified. The values of `hh`, `i`, and `pp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as follows: `hh` is a list where the value at index 3 is decreased by 1, `i` is either 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', and `h` is its initial value plus 1.

Output State: **`hh` is a list where the value at index 3 is decreased by 1, `i` is either 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `h` is its initial value + 1**
