`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` can be either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, after appending `'H'`, it will become `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`. The value of `h` is increased by 1 from its original value, so `h` is now one more than its original value. The value of `rr[3]` remains false, and the value of `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`. Since `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `h` is now one more than its original value, `r` will also be one more than its original value if it was less than `h`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is one more than its original value, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is one more than its original value if it was less than `h`.**
