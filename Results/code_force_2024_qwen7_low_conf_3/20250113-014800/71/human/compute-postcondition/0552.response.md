The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` was not defined before this line, it means `r` is being assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and `i` is not equal to 'W' and `i` is not equal to 'E' and the condition `(ss)` is false, and the first element of `rr` is False; `r` is 1**
