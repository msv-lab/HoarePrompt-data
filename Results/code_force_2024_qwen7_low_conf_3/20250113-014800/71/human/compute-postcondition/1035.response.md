`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The initial value of `pp` is an empty list, so after appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['R']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list where the first element is 1; `pp` is ['R'].

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list where the first element is 1; `pp` is ['R']**
