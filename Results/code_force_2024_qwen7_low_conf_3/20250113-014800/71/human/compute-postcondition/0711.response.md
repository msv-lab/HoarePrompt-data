Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is `hh[2] + 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `pp` contains `'H'` as the last element, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `h` remains unchanged, `r` is replaced with `r + 'H'`, `pp` is `pp` with an additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` remains unchanged. If none of the above conditions are met, then `h` is increased by 1, `r` is replaced with `r + 'H'`, `pp` is `pp` with an additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.***
