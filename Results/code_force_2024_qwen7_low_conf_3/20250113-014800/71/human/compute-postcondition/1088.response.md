The code `rr[3] += 1` increments the value at index 3 of the list `rr` by 1. Initially, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. After executing the code, the value at index 3 will be incremented from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 1], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
