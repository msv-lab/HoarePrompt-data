`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is `rr[0] + 1`, `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`, `pp` also retains its values from the previous iteration, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.
