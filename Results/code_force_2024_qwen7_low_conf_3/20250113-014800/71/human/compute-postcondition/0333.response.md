`pp.append('H')` adds the element `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, after appending `'H'`, `pp` will become `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string; `h` is increased by either 2 or 3; `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`; `rr[3]` remains false; and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.**
