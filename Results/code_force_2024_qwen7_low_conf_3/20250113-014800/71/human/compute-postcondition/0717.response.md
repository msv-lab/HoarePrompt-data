`pp` is a list that appends the string `'H'` to itself. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, and the values of `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, after executing `pp.append('H')`, the list `pp` will contain the string `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp` is now `['H']`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
