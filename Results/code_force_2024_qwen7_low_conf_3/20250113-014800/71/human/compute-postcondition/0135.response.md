The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a list that exists before this operation. After appending `'R'`, the value of `pp` changes, but no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `r` is 1, `rr[1]` is 0, `pp` is a list containing ['R']**
