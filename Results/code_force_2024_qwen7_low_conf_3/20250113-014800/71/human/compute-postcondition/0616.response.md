`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `pp` retains its value from the previous iteration and now includes `'H'`, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `hh` is the same list with its fourth element incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `pp` is a list with the additional element `'H'`, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` retains its value from the previous iteration, `hh` is the same list with its fourth element incremented by 1.**
