`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1; `pp` now contains the additional element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp` is `pp` with an additional element `'H'`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.**
