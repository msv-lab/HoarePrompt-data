The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it implies that `pp` is a new list being created. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `r`, `hh`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, `hh` is undefined, `pp` is a list containing `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, `hh` is undefined, `pp` is a list containing `'H'`**
