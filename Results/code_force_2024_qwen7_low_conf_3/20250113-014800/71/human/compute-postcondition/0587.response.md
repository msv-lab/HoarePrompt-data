The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. The initial state tells us that `h` retains its value from the previous iteration and that `hh[3]` is decreased by 1. Since `h` is part of `hh`, this means `hh[3]` was previously equal to `h`. After the increment, `h` will be equal to `hh[3] + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `h` is incremented by 1.
- `hh[3]` is now equal to `h - 1`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `hh[3]` is decreased by 1 and is now equal to `h - 1`.**
