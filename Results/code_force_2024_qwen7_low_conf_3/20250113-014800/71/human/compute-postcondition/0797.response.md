`s` is incremented by 1 because the code `s += 1` adds 1 to the current value of `s`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `n`, `w`, and `e`) remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` remains unchanged unless `i` is 'N', `s` is one more than its previous value, `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 1 if `i` is 'W', and `e` is increased by 1 if `i` is neither 'S' nor 'W'.**
