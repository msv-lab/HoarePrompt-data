Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, 2, or 3, `pp` can be one of `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `['H', 'R', 'H']`, or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`. If `i == 'W'`, `hh[3]` is decreased by 1 if the condition `hh[3]` is true, and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1, otherwise `hh[3]` is increased by 1 and `hh[1]` is increased by 1, while `nn` is decreased by 1.***
