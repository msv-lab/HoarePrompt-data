Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `r < h`, then `h`, `r+1`, `pp` is its previous value plus `'R'`, and `hh`'s first element is unchanged. If `r >= h`, then `hh`'s first element is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is now a list containing its previous elements plus `'H'`. `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
