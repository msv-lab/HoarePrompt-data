`r` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `r` is its previous value plus 1. The values of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `rr[3]`, and `h`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is `r+1`, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, and `h` is greater than `r`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is `r+1`, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, and `h` is greater than `r`**
