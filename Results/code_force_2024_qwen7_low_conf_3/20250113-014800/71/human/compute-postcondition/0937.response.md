The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, the list `pp` will contain the element `'R'`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'N', `pp` is ['R'], `rr` is a list where the first element is 0, `r` is incremented by 1.**
