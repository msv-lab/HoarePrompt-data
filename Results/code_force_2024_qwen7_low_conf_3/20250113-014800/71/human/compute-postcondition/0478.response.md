`pp` is a list that does not exist before this line. In the given code, `'H'` is appended to `pp`. Since `pp` did not exist previously, it is now created and contains the value `'H'`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `ee`, and `h`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `(ee % 2 == 0)` is true, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
