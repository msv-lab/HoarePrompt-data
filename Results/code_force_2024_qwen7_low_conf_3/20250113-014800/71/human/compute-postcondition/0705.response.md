`r` is incremented by 1, while the other variables retain their values from the previous iteration. The fourth element of `rr` is also incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, so it will be incremented again here.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, the fourth element of `rr` is incremented by 2.**
