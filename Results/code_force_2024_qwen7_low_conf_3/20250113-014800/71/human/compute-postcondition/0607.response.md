The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `pp` before this operation, we can only say that `'R'` is appended to `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is the list `pp` with `'R'` appended to it, `ww`, `rr`, `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `rr[2]` is reduced by 1**
