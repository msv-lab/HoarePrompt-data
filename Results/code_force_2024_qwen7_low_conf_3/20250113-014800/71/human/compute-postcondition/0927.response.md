The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a new list being initialized here. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the operation, and the other variables (`a`, `ss`, and `r`) are also unaffected. 

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'N', `ss` is true, `ss` is odd, `r` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
