`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not previously defined, it is now created as a list containing the single element `'R'`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `rr`, `r`, `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `rr` is a list with its fourth element increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, the states of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged; `pp` is ['R']**
