Postcondition: **`result` is either `['R', 'R']` or `['H', 'R']`, `s[i]` is a character, `count_north` is updated based on the value of `s[i]`, `count_south` is updated based on the value of `s[i]` and decreased by 1, `count_east` and `count_west` are updated based on the value of `s[i]`, and `i` is less than `len(s)`**.
