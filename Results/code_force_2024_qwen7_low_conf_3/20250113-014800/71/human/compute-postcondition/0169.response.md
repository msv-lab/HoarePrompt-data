`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The value of `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not 'N' and not 'S', `rr[0]` is False, and `r` is increased by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not 'N' and not 'S', `rr[0]` is False, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not 'N' and not 'S', `rr[0]` is False, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains the element `'R'`**
