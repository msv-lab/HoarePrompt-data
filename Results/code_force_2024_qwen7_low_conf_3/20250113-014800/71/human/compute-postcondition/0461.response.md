The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `pp`, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is false, `rr[2]` is `x + 1`, `hh[3] is false, `r` is less than `h + 1`, `pp` is ['R']**
