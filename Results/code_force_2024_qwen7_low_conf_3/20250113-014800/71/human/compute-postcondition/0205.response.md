`rr[2]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `rr[3]` is `false`, and since no other values of `rr` are specified, we assume `rr[2]` was `0`. After incrementing, `rr[2]` becomes `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false, `rr[2]` is 1**
