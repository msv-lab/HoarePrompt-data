The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since the initial state shows that `h` is increased by 1 (implying `h` was 1 before this operation), the new value of `h` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['H'], `hh[2]` is decreased by 1, `rr[3]` is False**
