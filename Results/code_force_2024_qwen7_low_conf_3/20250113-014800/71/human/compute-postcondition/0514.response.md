`nn` is decremented by 1. The value of `nn` was odd in the initial state, which means `r` was incremented by 1 and `pp` was a list containing `'R'`. After decrementing `nn`, `nn` becomes even (since an odd number minus 1 is even). Therefore, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing `'H'`. The values of `l`, `i`, `r`, `h`, and the list `pp` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', `r` is incremented by 1 (if it was odd), `h` is incremented by 1 (since `nn` became even), `pp` is a list containing `'H'`**.
