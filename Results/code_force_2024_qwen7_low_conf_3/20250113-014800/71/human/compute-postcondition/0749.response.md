`r` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `hh`, and `rr`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `rr` is updated by incrementing its second element by 1, `r` is increased by 1.**
