The code `rr[1] -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `rr[1]`. Since `rr[1]` was initially `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in numerical operations, the operation `rr[1] -= 1` will set `rr[1]` to `0`. The states of the other variables (`l` and `i`) are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is 0.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is 0**
