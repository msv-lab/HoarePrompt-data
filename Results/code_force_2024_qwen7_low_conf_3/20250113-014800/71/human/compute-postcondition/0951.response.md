`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not 'N', `rr[0]` is False, `r` is greater than or equal to `h+1`, `hh[1]` is 1, and `h` is increased by 1. The state of `i`, `a`, `rr[0]`, `r`, `hh[1]`, and `h` remains unchanged, except `h` is now `h+1`.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not 'N', `rr[0]` is False, `r` is greater than or equal to `h+1`, `hh[1]` is 1, `h` is `h+1`, `pp` is a list containing `'H'`**
