Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `ww`, `ee`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `r < h`, then `pp` now contains all previous elements plus `'R'`, and `rr` is updated by incrementing its second element by 1, with `r` also incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1.***
