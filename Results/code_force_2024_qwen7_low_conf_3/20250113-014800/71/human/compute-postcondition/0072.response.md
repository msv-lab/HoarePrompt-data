`count_west` is decremented by 1. The initial state only mentions `result`, which is a list containing ['H'], and does not mention `count_west`. Since `count_west` was not initially defined, its specific value cannot be determined from the given information, but it is reduced by 1. The list `result` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`result` is a list containing ['H'], `count_west` is decreased by 1**
