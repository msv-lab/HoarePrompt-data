`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of `i`, `h`, and `pp` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `r`.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `h` and `pp` adjust accordingly based on the value of `i`, `r` is increased by 1.**
