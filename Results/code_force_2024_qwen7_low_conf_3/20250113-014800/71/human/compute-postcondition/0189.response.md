Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, and `i` is either 'N' or not 'N'. If `i` is 'N', `l` remains unchanged, and depending on the initial value of `nn`, `pp` is either `['H']` or `['R']`, `r` is either 2 or 1, and `h` is either 1 or 1. If `rr[1]` is true, `pp` is `['H']`. If `rr[1]` is false and `r < h`, `r` is incremented by 1, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1, and `pp` remains `['R']`. If `rr[1]` is false and `r >= h`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains `['H']`. If `i` is not 'N', `l` remains unchanged, and if `i` is 'S' and `ss` is 0, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, and `ss` remains 0. If `rr[0]` is False, `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`. If `hh[0]` is False, `pp` is `['H']`. If `r < h`, `r` is incremented by 1, the second element of `rr` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains at least one element which is `'R'`. If `r >= h`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.**
