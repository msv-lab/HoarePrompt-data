`count_east` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `count_east`, so we cannot determine its exact new value, but we know it has decreased by 1. The state of `result` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`result` is a list containing the element `'R'`; `count_east` is decreased by 1**
