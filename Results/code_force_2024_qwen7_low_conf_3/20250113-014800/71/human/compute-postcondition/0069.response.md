The code `result.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `result`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `result`, we assume `result` is an existing list. After executing the code, the list `result` will have the string `'R'` added to its end.

Output State: **`result` is a list containing the element `'R'`**
