`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the first character of the string `l`, which is the remaining string after removing the first character from the original non-empty string. The values of `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. 

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `hh[2]` is decreased by 1.**
