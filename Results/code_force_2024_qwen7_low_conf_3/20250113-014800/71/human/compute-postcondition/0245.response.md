`pp` is a list containing 'H', and the code appends 'R' to this list. The length of the string `l` and the value of `h` are not affected by this operation. The values of `rr[1]` and `rr[3]` are not relevant to the operation, and `r` is increased by 1.

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `pp` is now `['H', 'R']`
- `r` is increased by 1

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `r` is increased by 1**
