`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The initial state does not specify the contents of `pp`, so after executing this line, `pp` will contain `'H'`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, the condition `hh[1]` is false, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing ['H']**
