Postcondition: ***`ww` is 3, `ee` is 0, `rr` is either `[0, 0, -1, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `hh` is either `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `r` is 2 or 3, `h` is 2 or 1, `pp` is either `['R', 'H']` or `['R', 'R']`, and `ss` is 0. Depending on the value of `i`, the updates to `rr` and `hh` could be as follows: 
- If `i` is 'E', then `ww` remains 3, `ee` is 0, `rr` could be `[0, 0, -1, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `hh` could be `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `r` is 2 or 3, `h` is 2 or 1, `pp` is either `['R', 'H']` or `['R', 'R']`.
- If `i` is 'N', then `rr` could be [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0, 0], or [1, 0, 0, 0], and `hh` could be [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0].
- If `i` is 'S', then `rr` is either [-1, 0, 0, 0] and `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], or `rr` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0] and `hh` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 1, 0].***
