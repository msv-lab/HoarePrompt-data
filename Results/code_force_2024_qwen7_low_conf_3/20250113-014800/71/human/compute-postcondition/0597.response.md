Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `rr[3]` is true, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` or remains as the original value plus 1 if `r >= h`, `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus `'R'` if `r < h` or a list containing the previous value of `pp` followed by `'H'` if `r >= h`, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` is a list where the third element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.***
