Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`. If `s[i]` is 'E', then `result` is `['R']`, `count_east` is the original value minus 1, and `count_west == count_east`. If `s[i]` is 'W', then `result` is `['H']`, `count_west` is `count_east - 1`, and `count_east == count_west`. Additionally, `count_north == count_south` remains unchanged.***
