Postcondition: ***`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is either [-1, 0, 0, 0] and `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], or `rr` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0] and `hh` is [0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 1, 0], `r` is 3, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'R'], and `ss` is 0.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the value of `ss` and the changes to the other variables accordingly.
