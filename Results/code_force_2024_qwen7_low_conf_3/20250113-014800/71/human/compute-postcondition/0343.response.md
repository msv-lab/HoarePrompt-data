The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and knowing that `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `r` was already increased before this line of code in some previous condition, but it is now guaranteed to be at least one less than `h` after this increment.

The other variables (`l`, `pp`, `rr[3]`, `rr[0]`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `l` is a non-empty string (unchanged)
- `h` is increased by either 1 or 2 (unchanged, just its future value is known to be at least 1 more than its current value)
- `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']` (unchanged)
- `rr[3]` remains false (unchanged)
- `r` is now `r + 1` (if `r < h` was true before, it is still true after this increment)

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is `r + 1`**
