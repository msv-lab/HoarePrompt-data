The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify what `pp` is, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, the list `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

The other variables (`i`, `a`, `rr`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; `a` is a list of integers; the third element of `rr` is False; `r` is 1; `pp` is a list containing ['R']**
