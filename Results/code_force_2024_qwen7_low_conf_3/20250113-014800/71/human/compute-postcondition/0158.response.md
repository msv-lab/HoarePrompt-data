`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not specified. The other variables (`l`, `i`, and `ss`) remain unchanged. Since `ss` is initially true and odd, its value remains true and it still is odd.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `ss` is true and odd, `r` is 1 more than its initial value**
