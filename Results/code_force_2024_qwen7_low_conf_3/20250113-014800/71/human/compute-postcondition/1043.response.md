`h` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `h` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`i`, the value at index 1 of the list `hh`, `h`, and `pp`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; the value at index 1 of the list `hh` is increased by 1; `h` is increased by 1; the states of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged.**
