`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `hh[2]` is incremented by 1. After appending `'H'` to `pp`, the updated state of `pp` is `[previous value of pp, 'H']`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r`, `pp` is [previous value of pp, 'H'], `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1.**
