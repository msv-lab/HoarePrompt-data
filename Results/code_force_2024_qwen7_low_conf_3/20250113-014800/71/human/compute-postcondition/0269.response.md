`h` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `h` is its previous value plus 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1 (so `h` is now `h+1`), `pp` is ['H'], `hh` is [0], `rr[3]` is false.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is `h+1`, `pp` is ['H'], `hh` is [0], `rr[3]` is false**
