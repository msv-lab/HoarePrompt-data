`rr` is updated by incrementing the second element (index 1) by 1. The first character of the string `l` is stored in `i`, and the values of `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. The output state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `rr` is updated by incrementing its second element by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `rr` is updated by incrementing its second element by 1.**
