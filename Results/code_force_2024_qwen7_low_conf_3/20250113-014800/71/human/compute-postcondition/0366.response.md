`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, after appending `'R'`, `pp` will become `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`.

The other variables (`l`, `h`, `rr[3]`, `r`, and `rr[1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1, and `rr[1]` is 2.**
