`r` is incremented by 1. Since `r` was increased by 1 if `r < h` in the initial state, `r` could be equal to `h` or `h + 1`. However, the exact value of `r` is not specified, so we know that `r` is now `r + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is `r + 1`.**
