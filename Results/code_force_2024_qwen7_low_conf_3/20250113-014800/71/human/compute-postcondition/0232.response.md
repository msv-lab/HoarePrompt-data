The code appends 'H' to the list `pp`. Initially, `pp` is `['H']`. After appending 'H', `pp` becomes `['H', 'H']`.

The other variables `l`, `h`, `hh[3]`, and `rr[3]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['H', 'H'], `hh[3]` is its previous value + 1, `rr[3]` is false**
