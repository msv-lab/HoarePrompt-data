`pp` is a list that appends the string `'H'` to its end. The value of `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is incremented by 1 (though the exact value of `h` is not given, it is known that it was incremented); `pp` now contains the element `'H'` in addition to whatever it contained before. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is incremented by 1; `pp` is a list containing 'H'**
