`rr` is a list where the second element (index 1) is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `l` is a string with its first character removed, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. After executing `rr[1] -= 1`, the value of `rr` changes.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `rr` is a list where the second element is decremented by 1.**
