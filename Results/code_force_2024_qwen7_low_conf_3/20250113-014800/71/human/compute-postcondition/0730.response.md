The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Given the initial state where `hh`'s first element is increased by 1, it means that `h` was already one element of `hh`. After executing `h += 1`, the value of `h` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `hh`'s first element is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
