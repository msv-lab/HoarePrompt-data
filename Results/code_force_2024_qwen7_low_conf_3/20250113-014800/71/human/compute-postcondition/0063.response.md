The code `result.append('R')` adds the string 'R' to the list `result`. Since the initial state does not provide any specific value for `result`, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending 'R', the list `result` will contain one element, which is 'R'.

Output State: **`result` is ['R']**
