`ee` is decremented by 1. Since the exact initial value of `ee` was not specified, let's denote the initial value of `ee` as `ee_initial`. After the decrement, `ee` becomes `ee_initial - 1`.

The other variables (`h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh`) remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `ee` is `ee_initial - 1`, `h` and `r` are each increased by 1 if `ee_initial` was odd, otherwise `h` is increased by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'` if `ee_initial` was odd, otherwise `pp` is a list with one additional element 'H', `ww` retains its previous value, `ee` retains its previous value, `rr` retains its previous value, and `hh` retains its previous value.**
