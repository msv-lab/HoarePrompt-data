The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `rr[0]` is incremented by 1; `r` is increased by 1.
