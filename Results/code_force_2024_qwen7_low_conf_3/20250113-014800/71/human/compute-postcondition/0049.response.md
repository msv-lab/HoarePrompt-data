`i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values. The initial state specifies that `i` is 0, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 1. The conditions for the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `t` is an integer, `result` is either `['R']` (if `s[i] == 'N'`) or `['H']` (if `s[i] != 'N'`), `count_north` and `count_south` differ by 1 (with `count_north` being one less than `count_south` if `s[i] == 'N'`), and `count_east == count_west`.**
