The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` retained its value from the previous iteration and was decreased by 1 previously, the new value of `r` is now one more than the value it had in the previous iteration. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `r` is one more than its value in the previous iteration, and `rr[1]` is decreased by 1.**
