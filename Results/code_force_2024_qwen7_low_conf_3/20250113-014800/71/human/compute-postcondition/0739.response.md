The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since no specific value was given for `pp` in the initial state, we will represent it as a list that includes 'H' appended to whatever was originally in `pp`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is the original list with 'H' appended, `ww` retains its value, `ee` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, `hh` retains its value.**
