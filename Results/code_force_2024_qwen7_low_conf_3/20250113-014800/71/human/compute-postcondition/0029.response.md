`count_east` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `count_east` is 2 if the next character is 'E', otherwise it remains 1, after incrementing, if the next character is 'E', `count_east` will become 3, otherwise it will remain 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count_north` is either 4 or 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` must have at least two characters, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is either 2 or 0, `count_east` is 3 if the next character is 'E', otherwise it remains 1, `count_west` is 2 if the next character is 'W', otherwise it remains 1, `i` is 1 if the next character is 'E', otherwise it is 0, and the current character `char` in the string `s` is the next character in `s`.

Output State: **`count_north` is either 4 or 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` must have at least two characters, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is either 2 or 0, `count_east` is 3 if the next character is 'E', otherwise it remains 1, `count_west` is 2 if the next character is 'W', otherwise it remains 1, `i` is 1 if the next character is 'E', otherwise it is 0, and the current character `char` in the string `s` is the next character in `s.`**
