`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not specified. However, the impact is that `r` is now increased by 1 compared to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false, `rr[2]` is 1, `r` is increased by 1**
