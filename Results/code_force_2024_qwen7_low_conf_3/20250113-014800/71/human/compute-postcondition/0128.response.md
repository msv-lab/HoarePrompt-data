`pp` is appended with the value 'H'. The value of `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'E' and its current value is 'N', the condition `(nn)` is true, `(nn % 2 == 1)` is false, and `h` is 1. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `pp` contains ['H'], `(nn)` is true, `(nn % 2 == 1)` is false, and `h` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `pp` contains ['H'], `(nn)` is true, `(nn % 2 == 1)` is false, and `h` is 1**
