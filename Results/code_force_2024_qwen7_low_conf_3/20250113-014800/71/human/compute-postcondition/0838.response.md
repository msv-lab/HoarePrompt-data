The code `hh[3] -= 1` decrements the value of `hh[3]` by 1. Given that `hh[3]` was initially `True`, we need to determine what the value of `True - 1` would be in Python. In Python, `True` is treated as `1` when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, `hh[3] -= 1` would make `hh[3]` equal to `0`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation. Thus, the updated values are:

- `i` is equal to 'W'
- `State` is a string
- `i` is equal to 'W'
- `ww` is False
- `hh[3]` is `0`

Output State: **`i` is equal to 'W', `State` is a string, `i` is equal to 'W', `ww` is False, `hh[3]` is 0**
