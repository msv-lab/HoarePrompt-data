`r` is incremented by 1, which means `r` is now one more than its previous value. The value of `r` was originally increased by 1 if `r < h`, but since this condition does not affect the final value directly mentioned here, we consider the general increment.

The output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `rr[2]` is increased by 1, and `r` is one more than its original value if `r < h`.**
