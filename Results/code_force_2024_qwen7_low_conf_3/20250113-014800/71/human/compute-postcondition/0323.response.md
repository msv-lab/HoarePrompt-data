`hh[3]` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `hh`, only that `hh[3]` is being modified. The value of `hh[3]` could be any integer, but it will be increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `hh[3]` is increased by 1.**
