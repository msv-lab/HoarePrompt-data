`r` is incremented by 1. Given the precondition that `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, the value of `r` will be 1 more than its original value. The conditions for `h`, `pp`, `rr[3]`, and `rr[1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is 1 more than its original value if `r < h`, `rr[1]` is `rr[1] - 1`.**
