`h` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `pp`, and the initial value of `h` (which is now `h + 1`) are preserved. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is the original value plus 1; `pp` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is the original value plus 1; `pp` remains unchanged.**
