`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The current state of `pp` is not specified, so we assume it was empty before this operation. The values of `l`, `i`, `ww`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `(ww)` is true and `ww` is an odd number, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is now a list containing the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `(ww)` is true and `ww` is an odd number, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R']**
