Postcondition: **`count_north` is either 2 or 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n` and must have at least one character, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is either 2 or 0, `count_east` is 1 if the character 'E' was encountered, otherwise it is 0, `count_west` is 1 if the character 'W' was encountered, otherwise it is 0, `i` is 1 if the character 'E' was encountered, otherwise it is 0, and the current character `char` in the string `s` is neither 'N' nor 'S'.**
