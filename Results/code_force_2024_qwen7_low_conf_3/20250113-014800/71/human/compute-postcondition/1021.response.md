The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `hh` is a list and its first element was incremented by 1 in the initial state, this operation does not affect `h`. The value of `i` can be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', and it remains unchanged. The values of `hh`, `pp`, and `i` are not directly modified by the code, so they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`hh` is a list with its first element incremented by 1; `i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is incremented by 1; the values of `pp` remain unchanged.**
