Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N'. If `hh[1]` is true, then `pp` is a list containing 'H'. Otherwise, if the condition `r < h` is true, `r` is incremented by 1, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['R']. If the condition `r < h` is false, then `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].**
