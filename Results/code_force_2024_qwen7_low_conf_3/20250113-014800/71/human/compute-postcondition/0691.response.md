Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` retain their values from the previous iteration, `hh` retains its value from the previous iteration, `pp` is either `pp` with `'R'` appended or `pp` with `'H'` appended depending on whether `ww` is odd, `ww` is decremented by 1 (if `ww` is true in the if part) or retains its value from the previous iteration (if `ww` is false in the else part), `ee` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` retains its value from the previous iteration, and if `rr[3]` is greater than 0, then `rr[3]` is decreased by 1 and `r` is increased by 1, otherwise, if `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1. If `hh[3]` is `hh_3 - 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the value it had before plus `'H'`.***
