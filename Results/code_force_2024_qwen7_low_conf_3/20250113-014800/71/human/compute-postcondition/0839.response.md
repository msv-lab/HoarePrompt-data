The value of `h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is not specified in the initial state. Since no specific initial value for `h` is given, we only know that `h` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to 'W', `State` is a string, `i` is equal to 'W', `ww` is False, `hh[3]` is 0, `h` is increased by 1**
