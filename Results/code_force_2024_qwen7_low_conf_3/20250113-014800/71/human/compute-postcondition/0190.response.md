Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is either 'E' or 'N' or not 'N'. If `i` is 'E', `r` and `h` may be modified according to the initial value of `ee` and `rr[2]` and `hh[2]`. Specifically:
- If `ee` was initially odd, `r` remains unchanged.
- If `ee` was initially even, `r` and `h` remain unchanged.
- If `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'.
- If `hh[2]` is false, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing ['H'].
- If `hh[2]` is true, `r` is incremented by 1, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, `h` is greater than `r`, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'.
- If `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, `hh` is undefined, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.

If `i` is 'N', `l` remains unchanged, and depending on the initial value of `nn`, `pp` is either `['H']` or `['R']`, `r` is either 2 or 1, and `h` is either 1 or 1. If `rr[1]` is true, `pp` is `['H']`. If `rr[1]` is false and `r < h`, `r` is incremented by 1, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1, and `pp` remains `['R']`. If `rr[1]` is false and `r >= h`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains `['H']`.

If `i` is neither 'E' nor 'N', `l` remains unchanged, and if `i` is 'S' and `ss` is 0, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, and `ss` remains 0. If `rr[0]` is False, `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`. If `hh[0]` is False, `pp` is `['H']`. If `r < h`, `r` is incremented by 1, the second element of `rr` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains at least one element which is `'R'`. If `r >= h`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes based on the value of `i` and the initial states of various variables.
