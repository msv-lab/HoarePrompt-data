`r` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `r` is less than `h`, so after incrementing `r` by 1, `r` is still less than `h`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and `i` is not equal to 'W' and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `rr[0]` is False, `r` is less than `h` + 1, and `rr[1]` is `rr[1]_initial + 1`**
