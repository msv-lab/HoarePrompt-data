`h` is incremented by 1, while the value of `i` remains 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; the states of `hh[0]` and `pp` adjust accordingly based on the new value of `hh[0]`. The previous value of `hh[0]` was decreased by 1, so the new value of `hh[0]` is now 0 (assuming it was initially 1). The state of `pp` depends on the value of `hh[0]`, which is now 0.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `hh[0]` is 0; `h` is increased by 1; the states of `pp` adjust accordingly based on the new value of `hh[0]`.**
