`r` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `r` is 2, so the new value of `r` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is `[-1, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is `['R']`.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is `[-1, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is `['R']**.
