`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `hh[2]` was increased by 1 previously, so it is now 2 (if the original value was 1). The values of `l`, `pp`, and `rr[3]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `hh[2]` is 2, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is False.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `hh[2]` is 2, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is False**
