Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, the current value of `i` is 'W', and the condition `ww` is false. If the fourth element of `rr` is true, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` becomes ['R'], and `hh` has at least four elements with the fourth element still being False. If the fourth element of `rr` is false, and `hh[3]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains as ['H']. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `hh[2]` is set to `x + 1`, `pp` becomes ['R'], and `r` is less than `h + 1`. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh[2]` becomes `True`, `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, and `pp` remains as ['H'].***
