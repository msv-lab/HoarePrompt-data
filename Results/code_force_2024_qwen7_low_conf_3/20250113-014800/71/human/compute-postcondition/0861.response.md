`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is not specified. Since `h` was not previously defined, we can assume it starts as 0. After the increment, `h` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; a is a list of integers; `ee` is true, and `ee` is not an odd number; `h` is 1**
