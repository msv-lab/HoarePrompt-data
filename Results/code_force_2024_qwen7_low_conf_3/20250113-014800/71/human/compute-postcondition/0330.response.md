The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, we need to consider the previous value of `r` in relation to `h`. Since `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, and `r` is initially increased by 1 if `r < h`, the following cases can be considered:

1. If `r < h` initially, `r` is increased by 1.
2. If `r >= h` initially, `r` remains unchanged.

However, since the exact initial values of `r` and `h` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `r`. But we know that `r` is increased by 1 if it was less than `h`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either ['H', 'R'] or ['H', 'H'], `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.**
