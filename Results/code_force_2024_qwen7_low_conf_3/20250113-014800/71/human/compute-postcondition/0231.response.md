The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since the initial state says `h` is increased by 1, this means `h` was already 1 before the code was run. Incrementing it by 1 makes `h` equal to 2. The other variables (`l`, `pp`, `hh[3]`, and `rr[3]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['H'], `hh[3]` is its previous value + 1, `rr[3]` is false**
