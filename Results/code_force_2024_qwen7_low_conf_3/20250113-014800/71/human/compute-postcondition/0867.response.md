`rr[2]` is decremented by 1. The initial state is that `rr[2]` is `True`. After decrementing `True` by 1, `rr[2]` will become `False` since `True` - 1 evaluates to `False`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; `a` is a list of integers; and the third element of `rr` is now `False`.

Output State: **`i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; `a` is a list of integers; the third element of `rr` is False.**
