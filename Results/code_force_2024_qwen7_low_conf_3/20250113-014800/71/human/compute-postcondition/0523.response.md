`h` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `h` is unknown, but it is now increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, the condition `hh[1]` is false, `h` is increased by 1.
