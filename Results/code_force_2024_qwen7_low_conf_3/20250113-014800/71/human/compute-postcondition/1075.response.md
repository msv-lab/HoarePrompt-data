Postcondition: **`ww` is 2, `ee` is 1. If `ww` is 2, then `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `['R', 'H']`. If `ww` is 3, then if `rr[3]` is non-zero, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, -1]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, and `pp` is `['R', 'R']`. If `hh[3]` is non-zero, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, -1]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `['R', 'H']`. If neither condition is met and `r` is less than `h`, `rr` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, and `pp` is `['R', 'R']`. Otherwise, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `['R', 'H']`.**
