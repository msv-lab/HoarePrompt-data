The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and `i` is not equal to 'W' and `i` is not equal to 'E' and the condition `(ss)` is false, and `hh[1]` is the original value of `hh[1]` + 1, and `rr[0]` is False, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'**
