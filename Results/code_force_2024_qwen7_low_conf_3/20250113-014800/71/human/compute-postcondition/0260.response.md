`pp` is a list that initially contains 'H'. The code appends 'R' to the list `pp`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `pp` is `['H', 'R']`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `rr[3]` is false, `r` is increased by 1**
