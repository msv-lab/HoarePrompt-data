Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2. If `ww` is True, `pp` is either ['H', 'R'] or ['H', 'H'], and `rr[3]` remains false. If `ww` is False, then `h` is increased by 1, and depending on the conditions: 
- If `rr[3]` is true, `h` is increased by 2, `pp` is ['H', 'H'], and `rr[3]` is set to false.
- If `r` is less than `h`, `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `rr[3]` is false, and `rr[2]` is 1.
- Otherwise, `pp` is ['H', 'H'], `rr[3]` is false, and `rr[2]` is false.***
