Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false. If `rr[1]` is true, then `pp` is ['R'], `h` remains unchanged, and `rr[1]` remains unchanged. If `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is ['H']. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, then `rr[0]` is 1 and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[0]` is 2, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].***
