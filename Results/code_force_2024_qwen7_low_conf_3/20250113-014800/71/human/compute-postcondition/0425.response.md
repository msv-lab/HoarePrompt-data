Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, and every character in `l` has been processed. If `n > s`, then `nn` is `n - s` and `ss` is 0. Otherwise, `nn` is 0 and `ss` is `s - n`. The current value of `w` is greater than the current value of `e`**.
