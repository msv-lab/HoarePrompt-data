The value of `h` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `h` is increased by 1 compared to its original value, while `l`, `pp`, `rr[3]`, and `r` retain their original conditions.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`; `rr[3]` remains false; `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`**
