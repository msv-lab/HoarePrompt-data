The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Since `r < h` was initially false and `h` is incremented by 1, the condition `r < h` remains false. The value of `i` is 'N' and the state of `l` as a non-empty string is unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', the condition `r < h` is false, `h` is incremented by 1**
