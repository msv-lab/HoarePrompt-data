`count_north` is decremented by 1. The original value of `count_north` was equal to `count_south`, so after decrementing, `count_north` will be one less than `count_south`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `t` is an integer, `result` is a list containing the element `'R'`, `count_north` is one less than `count_south`, `count_east == count_west**
