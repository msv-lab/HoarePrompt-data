The code appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given initial state, we can assume it is a new list created during this operation. The value of `l` remains a non-empty string, `i` remains `'E'`, `(hh[2])` remains `false`, and `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `(hh[2])` is false, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing ['H']**
