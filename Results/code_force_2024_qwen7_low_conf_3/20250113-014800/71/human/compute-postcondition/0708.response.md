`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1. Therefore, the updated value of `hh[3]` is the original value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.**
