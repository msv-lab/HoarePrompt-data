Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not 'N' and not 'S'. If `rr[0]` is False, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains the element `'R'`. Otherwise, if `hh[0]` is False, `pp` is ['H']. If `r` is less than `h`, `r` is incremented by 1 and the second element of `rr` is increased by 1, with `pp` containing at least one element which is `'R'`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['H']`.***
