`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the states of `rr`, `h`, and `pp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `rr` is a list with its fourth element increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, the states of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `rr` is a list with its fourth element increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, the states of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged.**
