Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the last character in `l`, `n` is the count of 'N' characters in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' characters in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' characters in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character (neither 'N', 'S', nor 'W') in `l`. If `n` is greater than `s`, then `nn` is `n - s` and `ss` is `0`; otherwise, `nn` is `0` and `ss` is `s - n`. `w` is not greater than `e`.**
