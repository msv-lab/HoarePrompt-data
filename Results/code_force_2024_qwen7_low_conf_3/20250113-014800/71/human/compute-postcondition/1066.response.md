The code `rr[2] += 1` increments the third element (index 2) of the list `rr` by 1. Initially, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. After executing this line, the third element will become `0 + 1 = 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `pp` is `['R']`**
