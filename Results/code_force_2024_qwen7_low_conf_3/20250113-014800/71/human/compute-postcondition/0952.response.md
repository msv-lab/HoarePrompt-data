Postcondition: ***`i` is a string and is equal to 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'N', `rr[0]` is False, `r` is an integer that is either 1 more than its original value (if `r < h`) or greater than or equal to `h+1` (if `r >= h`). If `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is 1, `pp` is a list containing ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is 1, `h` is `h+1`, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.***
