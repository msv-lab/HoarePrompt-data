The code `hh[1] += 1` increments the second element of the list `hh` by 1. Initially, the value of `hh[1]` is not specified, but it is updated to its original value plus 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and `i` is not equal to 'W' and `i` is not equal to 'E' and the condition `(ss)` is false, and `hh[1]` is the original value of `hh[1]` + 1, and `rr[0]` is False**
