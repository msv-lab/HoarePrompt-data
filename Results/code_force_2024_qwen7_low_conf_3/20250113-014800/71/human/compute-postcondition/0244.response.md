The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `r` is not specified, but it is updated. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[1]` is one less than its initial value, `rr[3]` is false, `r` is increased by 1.**
