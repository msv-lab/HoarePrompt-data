`e` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The length of string `l` also remains unchanged because the code does not modify the string `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'W'; `e` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'W'; `e` is increased by 1**
