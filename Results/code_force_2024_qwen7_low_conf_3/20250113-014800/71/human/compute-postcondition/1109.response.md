`pp` is a list containing the string 'R', and the code appends the string 'H' to this list. Therefore, the updated list in `pp` will be `['R', 'H']`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, -1, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'H']**
