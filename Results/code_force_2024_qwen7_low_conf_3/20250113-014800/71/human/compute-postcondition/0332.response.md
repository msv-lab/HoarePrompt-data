`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `h` was previously increased by either 1 or 2, so now it is increased by either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string; `h` is increased by either 2 or 3; `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`; `rr[3]` remains false; and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string; `h` is increased by either 2 or 3; `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`; `rr[3]` remains false; and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.**
