`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, appending `'H'` will change it to either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`. The length of `pp` increases by one, and the values of `l`, `h`, `rr[3]`, `r`, and `hh[2]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1 (from its original value of either 1 or 2), `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `hh[2]` is incremented by 1.**
