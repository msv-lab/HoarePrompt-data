`r` is incremented by 1. Since `r` was previously increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `h` can be either increased by 1 or 2, the exact initial value of `r` is not specified. However, it means that `r` is now one more than its previous value. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either ['H', 'R'] or ['H', 'H'], `rr[3]` is 1, and `r` is increased by 1.**
