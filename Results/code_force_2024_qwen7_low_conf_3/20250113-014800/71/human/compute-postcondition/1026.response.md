Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. After executing the if-else block, `r` is either increased by 1, or increased by 1 if `rr[1]` is true, or the first element of `rr` is increased by 2 if `hh[1]` is false and `r < h`. `h` is always incremented by 1. `pp` is a list containing the elements before execution plus `'R'` if `i` is 'W' or 'E', or a list with its last element being 'H' if `i` is 'N' or 'S'. `h` is adjusted based on the value of `i` (plus 1 if `i` is 'N' or 'S', and the original value if `i` is 'W' or 'E').***
