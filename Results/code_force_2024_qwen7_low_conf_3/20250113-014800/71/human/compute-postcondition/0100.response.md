`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `r` was not specified in the initial state, so we only know that `r` was previously undefined or had some initial value, now it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is 0, `r` is increased by 1**
