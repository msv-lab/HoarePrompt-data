Postcondition: `ww` is 0, `ee` is an integer, `rr` is a list of four integers, `hh` is a list of four integers, `r` is an integer, `h` is an integer, `pp` is a list of strings. If both `r` and `h` are non-zero, the function outputs the string formed by joining all elements of `pp`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.
