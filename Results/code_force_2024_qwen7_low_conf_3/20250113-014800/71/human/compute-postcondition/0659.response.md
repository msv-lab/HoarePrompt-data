The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `hh` is the list with its second element incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.
