Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. If `hh[3]` is true, then `hh` is updated to `[hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i` and now includes `'H'`. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 2, `h` remains unchanged, and `pp` is a list containing ['R']. If none of the above conditions are met, `i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `hh` is updated to `[hh[0], hh[1], hh[2]+1]`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i` and now includes `'H'`.***
