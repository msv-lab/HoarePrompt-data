The code increments the value of `hh[3]` by 1. Since `hh[2]` was initially `False`, this fact remains unchanged. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `r`, and `h`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated value of `hh[3]` is `False + 1`, which evaluates to `True`. The output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is False, `hh[3]` is True, `r` is greater than or equal to h**
