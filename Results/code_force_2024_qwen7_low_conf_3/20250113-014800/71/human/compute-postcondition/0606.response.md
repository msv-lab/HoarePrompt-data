`r` is incremented by 1, which means `r` is now one more than its previous value. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `rr[2]` is reduced by 1, and `r` is increased by 1.
