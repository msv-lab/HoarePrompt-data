The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before the code is executed. After executing the code, `pp` will contain the single element `'R'`.

Output State: **`i` is a string, currently equal to 'E', and not equal to 'W'; `a` is a list of integers; the condition `rr[2]` is false; the value of `r` is less than `h` and has been incremented by 1; `rr[3]` is its original value plus 1; `pp` is a list containing ['R']**
