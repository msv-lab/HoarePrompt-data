`s` is incremented by 1, which means `s` is assigned the value of its current value plus 1. The initial value of `s` is not specified, but it is implied to be the first character of the string `l`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `s` is the first character of `l` plus 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `s` is the first character of `l` plus 1**
