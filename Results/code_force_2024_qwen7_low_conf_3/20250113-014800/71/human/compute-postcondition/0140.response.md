The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, we can assume it is being created as a new list when this append operation occurs. The other variables (`l`, `i`, and `hh[1]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `hh[1]` is 1, `pp` is a list containing 'H'**
