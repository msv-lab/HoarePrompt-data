The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is initialized as an empty list before this code is executed. The initial values and conditions of the other variables remain unchanged.

- `l` is a non-empty string
- `i` is 'N'
- `r < h` is true with `r` now being `r + 1`, which means `r` has been incremented by 1
- `rr` is a list where the first element is increased by 1

After executing `pp.append('R')`, the list `pp` will contain the string `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `r < h` is true with `r` now being `r + 1`, `rr` is a list where the first element is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R']**
