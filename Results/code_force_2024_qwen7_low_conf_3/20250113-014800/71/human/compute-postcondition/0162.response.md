The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'`, the list `pp` will contain `'H'`.

Other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `ss` is true and not odd, `h` is the original value of `h` plus 1, `pp` is ['H']**
