`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `ww` is an odd number, and the value of `i` is 'W'. The value of `l` remains a non-empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, the current value of `i` is 'W', the condition `(ww)` is true, the current value of `ww` is an odd number, and `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, the current value of `i` is 'W', the condition `(ww)` is true, the current value of `ww` is an odd number, `r` is increased by 1**
