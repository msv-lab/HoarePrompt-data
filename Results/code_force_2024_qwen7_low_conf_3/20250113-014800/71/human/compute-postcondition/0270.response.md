The code snippet `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Given the initial state, `pp` is initially `['H']`. After appending `'H'`, `pp` becomes `['H', 'H']`.

The states of the other variables (`l`, `h`, `hh`, and `rr[3]`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is `h+1`, `pp` is `['H', 'H']`, `hh` is `[0]`, `rr[3]` is `false`**
