`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` initially contains the element `'H'`, after appending `'R'`, `pp` will contain two elements: `'H'` and `'R'`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H', 'R'], `rr[3]` is false, `r` is increased by 1**
