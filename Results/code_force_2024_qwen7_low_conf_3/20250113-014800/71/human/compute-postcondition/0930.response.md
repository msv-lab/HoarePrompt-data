The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it is an empty list before this operation. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `ss`, `ss % 2 == 0`, and `h`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'N', `ss` is True, `ss % 2 == 0`, and `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is now a list containing the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'N', `ss` is True, `ss % 2 == 0`, and `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'**
