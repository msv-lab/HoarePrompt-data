The code `hh[1] += 1` increments the second element (index 1) of the list `hh` by 1. Initially, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. After executing the code, the second element of `hh` will be `0 + 1 = 1`. The other elements remain unchanged, and the values of the other variables (`ww`, `ee`, `rr`, `r`, `h`, `pp`) are not affected.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 1, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
