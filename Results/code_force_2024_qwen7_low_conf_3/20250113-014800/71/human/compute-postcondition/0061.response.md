Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` is either `['R']` or `['H']` based on the value of `s[i]`, `count_north` and `count_south` differ by 1 if `s[i] == 'N'`, and `count_east` and `count_west` are adjusted accordingly as per the value of `s[i]`. Specifically, if `s[i]` is 'N', `count_north` is one less than `count_south`; if `s[i]` is 'S', `count_south` is one less than `count_north`; if `s[1]` is 'E', `count_east` is the original value minus 1, and if `s[1]` is 'W', `count_west` is `count_east - 1`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the entire if-else block, covering all possible outcomes of the conditional checks.
