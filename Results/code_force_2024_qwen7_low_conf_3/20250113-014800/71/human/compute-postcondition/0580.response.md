`pp` is appended with the value 'H', which means `pp` gains an additional element 'H'. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `pp` is now a list containing its previous elements plus 'H', `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `hh` retains its value from the previous iteration.
