Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
2. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `count_north` is either 2 or 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n` and must have at least one character.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `count_south` is either 2 or 0.
   - `count_east` is 1 if the character 'E' was encountered, otherwise it is 0.
   - `count_west` is 1 if the character 'W' was encountered, otherwise it is 0.
   - `i` is 1 if the character 'E' was encountered, otherwise it is 0.
   - The current character `char` in the string `s` is neither 'N' nor 'S'.

3. **Determine the Next Character**:
   - Since `char` is neither 'N' nor 'S', the next character `char` must be either 'E' or 'W'.

4. **Update the States**:
   - If `char` is 'E':
     - `count_east` will be updated to 1 (if it was 0) or remain 1 (if it was already 1).
     - `i` will be updated to 1 (since 'E' was encountered).
   - If `char` is 'W':
     - `count_west` will be updated to 1 (if it was 0) or remain 1 (if it was already 1).

5. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new states:

- `count_north` remains either 2 or 0.
- `n` remains the same since the length of `s` does not change within the loop.
- `s` will now have one fewer character, but still must have at least one character.
- `t` remains the same since the value of `t` is not affected by the loop.
- `count_south` remains either 2 or 0.
- `count_east` becomes 1 (if it was 0 before the update) or remains 1 (if it was 1 before the update).
- `count_west` becomes 1 (if it was 0 before the update) or remains 1 (if it was 1 before the update).
- `i` becomes 1 (if the next character is 'E') or remains 0 (if the next character is 'W').
- The current character `char` in the string `s` will be the next character in `s`.

State: **`count_north` is either 2 or 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n-1` and must have at least one character, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is either 2 or 0, `count_east` is 1 (if the next character is 'E'), otherwise it is 1 (if it was 1 before), `count_west` is 1 (if the next character is 'W'), otherwise it is 1 (if it was 1 before), `i` is 1 (if the next character is 'E'), otherwise it is 0 (if the next character is 'W'), and the current character `char` in the string `s` is the next character in `s`**.
