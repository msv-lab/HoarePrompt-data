`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given state, it means `pp` is now a list containing one element `'R'`. The values of `i` and `rr[2]` remain unchanged, and `h` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr[2]` is incremented by 2; `h` remains unchanged; `pp` is a list containing ['R']**
