`rr[1]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[1]` is not specified, so let's denote it as `rr[1]_initial`. After the increment, `rr[1]` becomes `rr[1]_initial + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and `i` is not equal to 'W' and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `rr[0]` is False, `r` is less than `h`, and `rr[1]` is `rr[1]_initial + 1`**
