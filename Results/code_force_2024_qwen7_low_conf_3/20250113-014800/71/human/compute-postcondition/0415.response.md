The code `e += 1` increments the value of `e` by 1. Since `e` was previously 1 (as per the initial state when the next character in `l` is 'W' or 'N'), it will now be 2. The value of `e` is now 2, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 1, `s` and `w` are updated based on the next character in `l`, `e` is 2, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0, and the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N'**
