The code increments the value of `rr[1]` by 1. Initially, `rr[0]` is `False`, and `rr[1]` is not specified, but it will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is a string and is equal to 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'N', `rr[0]` is False, `rr[1]` is 1 (assuming it was 0 initially)**
