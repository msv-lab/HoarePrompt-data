Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E'. Depending on the initial value of `ee`, `r` and `h` may be modified as follows: 
- If `ee` was initially odd, `r` remains unchanged.
- If `ee` was initially even, `r` and `h` remain unchanged.
- If `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'.
- If `hh[2]` is false, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing ['H'].
- If `hh[2]` is true, `r` is incremented by 1, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, `h` is greater than `r`, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'.
- If `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, `hh` is undefined, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.***
