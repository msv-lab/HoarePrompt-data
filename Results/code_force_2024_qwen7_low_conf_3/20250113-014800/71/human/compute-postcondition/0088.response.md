Postcondition: ***`s[i]` is a character, `result` is either `['R', 'R']` or `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']` or `['H']`, `count_north`, `count_south`, `count_east`, and `count_west` are updated based on the value of `s[i]`, and `i` is less than `len(s)`. If `s[i]` is 'E', `count_east` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_west` is decremented by 1.***
