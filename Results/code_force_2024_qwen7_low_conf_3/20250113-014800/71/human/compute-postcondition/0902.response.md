`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not specified in the initial state. Since `r` is not mentioned in the initial state and no other variable is directly affected by this line of code, the only variable that changes is `r`. The output state is: `i` is 'N', `a` is a list of integers, `rr[1]` is 0, and `r` is 1 (assuming `r` was initialized to 0 before this line of code).

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `a` is a list of integers, `rr[1]` is 0, `r` is 1**
