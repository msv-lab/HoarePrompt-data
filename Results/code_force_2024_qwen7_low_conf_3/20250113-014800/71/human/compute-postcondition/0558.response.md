`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The list `pp` did not exist before, so it is now initialized as `['H']`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'W' and 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `rr[0]` is False, `h` is 1, and `pp` is `['H']`.
