Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and `h`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `i == 'E'`:
- `ee` is `ee_initial - 1`. Depending on the initial value of `ee_initial`, `h` and `r` are updated as follows:
  - If `ee_initial` was odd, `h` and `r` are each increased by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`.
  - If `ee_initial` was even, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains `'H'` as the last element.
  - If `rr[2]` is greater than 0, `pp` has one additional element `'R'`, `r` is increased by 1, and `rr[2]` is decreased by 1.
  - If `hh[2]` is true, `h` is `hh[2] + 1`, `pp` contains `'H'` as the last element, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.
  - If `r < h`, `h` remains unchanged, `r` is replaced with `r + 'H'`, `pp` is `pp` with an additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` remains unchanged.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is replaced with `r + 'H'`, `pp` is `pp` with an additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.
- If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 1`, then `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 0`, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is now `['H']`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is now a list containing the element `'R'`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is false and `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'R']`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is false, `r < h`, then `h` remains unchanged, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'R']`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is false, `r >= h`, then `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'H']`.
- If `i == 'S'`, then `h` is increased by 1. If `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'`. Otherwise, `r` retains its value and `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended.
- If `i != 'S'`, then depending on the condition `rr[0]`, `h` is `rr[0] + 1` and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`. Or if `hh[0]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'H'` appended, `hh[0]` is decreased by 1, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1. Or if `r < h`, then `pp` contains all previous elements plus `'R'`, `rr` is incremented by 1, and `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1. `ww`, `ee`, and `rr` retain their values from the previous iteration.***
