`hh[1]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was previously (since it's not specified, we assume it's 0 initially) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not 'N', `rr[0]` is False, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `hh[1]` is 1**
