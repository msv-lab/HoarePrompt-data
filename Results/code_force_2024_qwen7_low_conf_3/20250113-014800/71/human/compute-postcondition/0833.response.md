The code `rr[3] -= 1` decrements the value at index 3 of the list `rr` by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `rr` is a boolean list and its fourth element (index 3) is True, decrementing a boolean value by 1 does not make sense in this context because booleans are not numeric types. However, we can assume that the boolean value is converted to its corresponding integer value (True to 1 and False to 0), the subtraction is performed, and then the result is converted back to a boolean.

- Initially, `rr[3]` is `True`, which is equivalent to `1`.
- After executing `rr[3] -= 1`, `rr[3]` becomes `0`, which is equivalent to `False`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', `ww` is False, `rr` is a boolean list with its fourth element being `False`.**
