Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E'. If `hh[2]` is false, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing ['H']. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, `h` is greater than `r`, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'. If `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, then `hh` is undefined, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.***
