`pp` is a list that previously had either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`. After appending 'H' to `pp`, the new list will be `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`. The value of `h` was increased by its previous value plus 1, and `r` was increased by 1 if `r < h`. The conditions for these changes are not specified in detail, so we consider the general case.

- If `h` was initially `i` and then increased by 1, it becomes `i + 1`.
- If `r` was less than `h` before the increment, `r` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged.
- The values of `rr[3]` and `hh[0]` remain unchanged.

Since the exact initial values of `h` and `r` are not specified, we keep them as expressions reflecting their changes.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by its previous value plus 1, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`**
