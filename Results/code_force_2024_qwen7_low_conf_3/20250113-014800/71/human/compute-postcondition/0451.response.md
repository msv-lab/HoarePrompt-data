The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, we assume it is being initialized to `[]` (an empty list) before this line of code is executed. The initial state does not provide any specific values for `l`, `i`, `ww`, and `r`.

After executing the code:
- `pp` is now `['R']`.
- `l`, `i`, `ww`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, the current value of `i` is 'W', and the condition `ww` is false; `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R']**.
