The code `ss -= 1` decrements the value of `ss` by 1. Given the initial conditions, we know the following:
- `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string.
- `i` is the first character of the remaining string.
- `h` is increased by 1.
- If `ss % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'`.
- Otherwise, `r` retains its value and `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended.

Since `ss -= 1` only affects `ss` by decrementing it by 1, and no other changes are made to the variables in this line of code, the values of `l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ss` is now `ss - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, if `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1` then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'`, otherwise `r` retains its value and `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
