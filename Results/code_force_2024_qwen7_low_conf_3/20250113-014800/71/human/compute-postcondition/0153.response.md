Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 'N'. If `nn` was initially odd, then `pp` is `['H']`, `r` is 2, and `h` is 1. If `nn` was initially even, then `pp` is `['R']`, `r` is 1, and `h` is 1. Additionally, if `rr[1]` is true, then `pp` is a list containing 'H'. If `rr[1]` is false and `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['R']. If `rr[1]` is false and `r >= h`, then `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].***
