Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 2 if the next character in `l` equals 'N' and 1 otherwise, `s` and `w` are updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` equals 'S', `s` becomes 2. Otherwise, `s` remains 1 and `w` becomes 2 if `i` equals 'W'. `e` becomes 1 if the next character in `l` is 'W' or 'N'. `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0; the character `i` is not equal to 'N'.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, combining the updates and ensuring the overall state of the program variables after the if-else block executes.
