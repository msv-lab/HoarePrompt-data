`pp` is a list that appends 'R' to its end. The initial value of `pp` is either ['H', 'R'] or ['H', 'H']. Appending 'R' to `pp` will change it to either ['H', 'R', 'R'] or ['H', 'H', 'R']. The value of `l`, `h`, `r`, and `rr[3]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either ['H', 'R', 'R'] or ['H', 'H', 'R'], `rr[3]` remains false, the value of `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` and decreased by 1 if `r >= h`.**
