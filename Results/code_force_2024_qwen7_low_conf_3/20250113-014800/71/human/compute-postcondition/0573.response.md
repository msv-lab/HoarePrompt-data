Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, and `i` is either 'N' or 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'W' or 'E'. If `i` is 'N': - If `nn` was true, then `r` is incremented by 1 (if it was odd), `h` is incremented by 1 (since `nn` became even), and `pp` is a list containing `'H'`. - If `nn` was false, then if `rr[1]` is true, `pp` is ['R'], `h` remains unchanged, and `rr[1]` remains unchanged. - If `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is ['H']. - Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, then `rr[0]` is 1 and `pp` is ['R']. - Otherwise, `hh[0]` is 2, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H']. If `i` is 'S': - If `ss` was true and odd, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is ['H']. - If `ss` was true and even, `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1 and `pp` is ['R']. - Otherwise, if `rr[0]` is False, then `r` is 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`. - If `r` is less than `h`, then `rr[1]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains a list containing 'R'. - If `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, then `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is increased by 1.***
