`e` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `s`, `w`, or their relationship to `i`. The output state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is updated based on the previous `i`, `s` is updated based on the previous `i`, `w` is updated based on the previous `i`, `e` is increased by 1.
