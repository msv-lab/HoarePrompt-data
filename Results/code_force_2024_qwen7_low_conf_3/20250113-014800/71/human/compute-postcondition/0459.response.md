`rr[2]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[2]` is not specified, so let's denote it as `x`. After the increment, `rr[2]` becomes `x + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is false, `rr[2]` is `x + 1`, `hh[3]` is false, and `r` is less than `h`**
