`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` was 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'S', and 0 otherwise. After incrementing, `s` will now be 2 if the next character in `l` equals 'S', and 1 otherwise. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'N', and 0 otherwise, `s` is 2 if the next character in `l` equals 'S', and 1 otherwise, `w` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'W', and 0 otherwise, `e` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'W' or 'N', and 0 otherwise, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, and the character `i` is not equal to 'N'.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'N', and 0 otherwise, `s` is 2 if the next character in `l` equals 'S', and 1 otherwise, `w` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'W', and 0 otherwise, `e` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'W' or 'N', and 0 otherwise, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, and the character `i` is not equal to 'N'.**
