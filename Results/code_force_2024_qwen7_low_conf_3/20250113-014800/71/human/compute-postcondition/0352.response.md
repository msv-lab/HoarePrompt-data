The value of `r` is incremented by 1 if `r < h`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `r` and `h`, we know that `r` is increased by 1 only if its current value is less than `h`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `r` based on this condition.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.**
