`h` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`i`, `l`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, `hh`, `hh[3]`) retain their previous values from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state of `h` is its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is its previous value + 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `hh[3]` is `hh_3 - 1`**
