`pp.append('H')` adds the element `'H'` to the list `pp`. Given that `pp` was either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, appending `'H'` will change its state to `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, `hh[3]` is decreased by 1**
