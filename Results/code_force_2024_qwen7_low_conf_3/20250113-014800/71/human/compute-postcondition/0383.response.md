Postcondition: ***`l` is a string, `r` is the final count based on the parity of `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss`, `h` is the final count based on the parity of `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss`, `pp` is the list of decisions ('R' or 'H') made during the loop, `rr` is the final state of the counters, `hh` is the final state of the counters. If both `r` and `h` are true, the program prints the concatenated string of `pp`. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.***
