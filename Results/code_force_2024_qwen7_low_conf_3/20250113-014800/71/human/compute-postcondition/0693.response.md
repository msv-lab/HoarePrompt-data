`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` are increased by 1, and `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` are increased by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`, `ww` retains its previous value, `ee` retains its previous value, `rr` retains its previous value, and `hh` retains its previous value.**
