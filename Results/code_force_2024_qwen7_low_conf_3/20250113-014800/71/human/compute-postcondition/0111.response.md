The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is being initialized or declared before this line of code. The values of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `r`, `rr`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is `r+1`, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, and `h` is greater than `r`; `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'.**
