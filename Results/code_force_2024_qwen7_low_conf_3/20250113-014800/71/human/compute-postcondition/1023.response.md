Postcondition: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. If `r < h`, then the first element of `rr` is increased by 2, and `pp` includes the element `'R'`. Otherwise, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, `i` remains 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains the original elements plus `'H'`.**
