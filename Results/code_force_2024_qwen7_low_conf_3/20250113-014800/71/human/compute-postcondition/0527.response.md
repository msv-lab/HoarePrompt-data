`rr[0]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[0]` is not specified, but since it is not given, we assume it is 0 (as it is the default value for an uninitialized list index). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, and `r` is less than `h`; `rr[0]` is 1**
