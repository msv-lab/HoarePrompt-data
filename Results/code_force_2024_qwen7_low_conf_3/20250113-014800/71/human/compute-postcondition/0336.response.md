`rr[1]` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `rr[1]` is not specified. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `rr[1]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, `rr[1]` is `rr[1] - 1`.**
