The code snippet `pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `pp` before this operation. Therefore, the only change is that the list `pp` now contains the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `h` is increased by 1, and `ss` is even; `pp` is a list containing 'H'.**
