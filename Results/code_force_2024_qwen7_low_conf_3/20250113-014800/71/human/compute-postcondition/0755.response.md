Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. Depending on the condition `hh[0]`, either `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is updated with `'H'` appended, `hh[0]` decreased by 1, and other variables updated accordingly; or if `r < h`, then `pp` contains all previous elements plus `'R'`, `rr` is incremented by 1, and `r` incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1.**
