`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not specified in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After the operation, `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is a string and is not equal to 'E', `a` is a list of integers, `rr[0]` is increased by 1, r is increased by 1, the condition r+1 < h is true, pp is ['R']**
