`pp` is a list that appends 'R' to itself. The value of `pp` was either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`. After appending 'R', the possible values of `pp` are `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is 1 more than its original value if `r < h`, `rr[1]` is `rr[1] - 1`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is 1 more than its original value if `r < h`, `rr[1]` is `rr[1] - 1`.**
