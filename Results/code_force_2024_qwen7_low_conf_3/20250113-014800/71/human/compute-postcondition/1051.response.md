Postcondition: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. After executing the if-else block, the following conditions apply:

- If `i` is 'E', and `ee` changes from odd to even, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['R']`. If `ee` changes from even to odd, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['H']`. If `rr[2]` is True, then `rr[2]` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']`. If `hh[2]` is True, then `hh[2]` is decreased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`. If `r < h`, then `rr[4]` is increased by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` and `pp` remain unchanged with `pp` being `['R']`. If `r >= h`, then `h` is set to `hh[3] + 1` and `pp` is set to `[hh[3] + 1, 'H']`.
- If `i` is 'N', `r` is increased by 1 if `rr[1]` is true, or increased by 1 if `hh[1]` is false and `r < h`, otherwise `r` is not changed. `h` is always incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the elements before execution plus 'R' if `i` is 'W' or 'E', or a list with its last element being 'H' if `i` is 'N' or 'S'. `h` is adjusted based on the value of `i` (plus 1 if `i` is 'N' or 'S', and the original value if `i` is 'W' or 'E').
- If `i` is 'S', and the original `ss` was odd and now even, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing 'H'. If the original `ss` was even and now odd, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list containing 'R'. If `rr[0]` is true, then `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H']. If `hh[0]` is true, then `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H']. If `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is increased by 2, `h` remains unchanged, and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains at least one element which is 'H'.
- For other values of `i` ('W' or 'E'), `r` is not changed, `h` is always incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the elements before execution plus 'R' if `i` is 'W' or 'E', or a list with its last element being 'H' if `i` is 'N' or 'S'.**
