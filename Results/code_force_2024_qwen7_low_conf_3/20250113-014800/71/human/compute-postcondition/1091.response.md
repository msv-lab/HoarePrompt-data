`hh[3]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, so `hh[3]` is 0. After the increment, `hh[3]` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `pp` is `['R']`.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `pp` is `['R']**.
