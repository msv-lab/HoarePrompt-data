The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Given the initial state, `pp` is `['H']`. After appending 'H', `pp` becomes `['H', 'H']`.

The other variables (`l`, `h`, `hh[3]`, and `rr[3]`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 2, `pp` is ['H', 'H'], `hh[3]` is decreased by 1, `rr[3]` is false**
