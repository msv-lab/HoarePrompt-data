The code `print(''.join(pp))` does not modify any of the variables. It simply prints the concatenation of all elements in the list `pp`. Since `pp` is a list of characters representing the final state of `pp`, printing this list will display the final string formed by joining all characters in `pp`.

Given that `pp` is the final list of characters representing the final state of `pp`, the output of `print(''.join(pp))` will be the final string formed by these characters.

Since no variables are modified, the output state remains unchanged except for the print statement which outputs the string represented by `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is the empty string, `i` is an undefined character (since `l` is empty), `h` is the final value of `h` after processing all characters in `l`, `r` is the final value of `r` after processing all characters in `l`. Both `h` and `r` are true. `pp` is the final list of characters representing the final state of `pp`, `ww` is the final value of `ww` after processing all characters in `l`, `ee` is the final value of `ee` after processing all characters in `l`, `nn` is the final value of `nn` after processing all characters in `l`, `ss` is the final value of `ss` after processing all characters in `l`, `rr` is the final list of integers representing the final state of `rr`, and `hh` is the final list of integers representing the final state of `hh`. The string `pp` is printed.**
