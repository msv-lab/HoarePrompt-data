`pp` is a list to which the value 'R' is appended. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp` is now a list containing its previous elements plus 'R', `ww`, `ee`, `rr[3]` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `hh` retains its value from the previous iteration.
