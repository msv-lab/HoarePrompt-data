`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is increased by 1, so the new value of `h` is its original value plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1 from its original value, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1 from its original value, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.**
