Postcondition: ***`i` is a string currently equal to 'E' and not equal to 'W'; `a` is a list of integers; `pp` is either a list containing ['R'] or ['H']; `rr[2]` remains false. If `r` is less than `h`, `rr[3]` is its original value plus 1 and `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1` and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.***
