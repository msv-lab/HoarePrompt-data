The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r`, `pp` is now `pp` with `'H'` appended, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh[0]` is incremented by 1.**
