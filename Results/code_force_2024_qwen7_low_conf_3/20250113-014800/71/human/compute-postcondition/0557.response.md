`h` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `h` is 0, so now `h` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'W' and 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `rr[0]` is False, `h` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'W' and 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `rr[0]` is False, `h` is 1**
