Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'N'. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged unless `i` is 'N'. `s` is one more than its previous value if `i` is 'S'. `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 1 if `i` is 'W', and `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 2 if `i` is 'W' and the previous value of `i` was not 'N'. `e` is increased by 1 regardless of the value of `i`.***
