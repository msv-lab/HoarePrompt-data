The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not initially defined in the given initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'`, `pp` will contain the element `'H'`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is equal to 'W', `State` is a string, `ww` is False, `rr[3]` is False, `hh[3]` is False, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
