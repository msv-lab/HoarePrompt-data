`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not specified. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is to `r`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false, `r` is increased by 1**
