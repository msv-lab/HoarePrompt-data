`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a list. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', `nn` is odd, `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing `'R'`**
