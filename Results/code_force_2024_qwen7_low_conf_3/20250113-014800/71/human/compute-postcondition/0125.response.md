The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify what `pp` is, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['R']`.

The other variables (`l`, `i`, `nn`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `nn` is an odd number, `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['R']**
