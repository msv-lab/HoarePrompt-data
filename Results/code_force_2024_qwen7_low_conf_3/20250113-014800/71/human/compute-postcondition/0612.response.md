The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` retains its value from the previous iteration and the value at index 3 of `rr` is incremented by 1, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, the value at index 3 of `rr` is incremented by 1, and `r` is increased by 1.**
