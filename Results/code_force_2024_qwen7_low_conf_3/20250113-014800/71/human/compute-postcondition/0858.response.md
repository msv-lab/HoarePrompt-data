`r` is incremented by 1, while `i` remains a string not equal to 'W' and currently equal to 'E', `a` remains a list of integers, and `ee` remains true and odd. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; `a` is a list of integers; the value of `ee` is true and odd; `r` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; `a` is a list of integers; the value of `ee` is true and odd; `r` is incremented by 1**
