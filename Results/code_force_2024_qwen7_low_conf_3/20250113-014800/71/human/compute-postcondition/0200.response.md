`r` is incremented by 1, and the initial value of `r` is not specified in the initial state, so it is unknown. However, we know that `r` was previously increased by 1, making it `h + 1`. Since `h` is increased by 1, `h` is now 2 (assuming it was initially 1). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is -1, `r` is `h + 1`**
