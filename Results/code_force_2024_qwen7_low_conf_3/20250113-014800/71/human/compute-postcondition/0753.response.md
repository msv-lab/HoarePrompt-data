`pp` is a list that appends the string `'H'` to itself. The previous value of `pp` is unknown, but after appending `'H'`, the new value of `pp` is `['H']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r`, `pp` is now `['H']`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `hh[1]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, `r`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `hh[1]` is incremented by 1.**
