The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before the code execution. After appending `'R'`, the list `pp` will contain `'R'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `pp` is ['R'], and `rr[1]` is 1**
