`pp` is a list containing the element 'R', and the code appends 'H' to this list. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, -1], `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'H'].

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, -1], `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'H']**
