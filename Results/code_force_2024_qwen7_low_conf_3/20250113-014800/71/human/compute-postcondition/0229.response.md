`pp.append('R')` appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. The previous value of `pp` was `['H']`, so after appending 'R', `pp` becomes `['H', 'R']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` is True, `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` is True, `r` is increased by 1**
