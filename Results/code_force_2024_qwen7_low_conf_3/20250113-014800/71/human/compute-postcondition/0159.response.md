The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. However, the initial state does not specify what `pp` is. Since `pp` is not mentioned in the initial state and no other initialization or declaration of `pp` is given, we assume `pp` is an empty list before the code execution.

After executing `pp.append('R')`, the list `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `ss` is true and odd, `r` is 1 more than its initial value, `pp` is ['R']**
