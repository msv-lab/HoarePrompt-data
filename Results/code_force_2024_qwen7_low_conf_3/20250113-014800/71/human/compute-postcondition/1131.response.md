`pp` is a list that initially contains the element `'R'`. The code snippet `pp.append('H')` adds the element `'H'` to the list `pp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated list `pp` will contain both `'R'` and `'H'`.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [-1, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'H']**
