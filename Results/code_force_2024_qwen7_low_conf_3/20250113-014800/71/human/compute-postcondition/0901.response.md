The value of `rr[1]` is decremented by 1. Since `rr[1]` was initially `True`, which in Python is equivalent to 1, decrementing it by 1 results in `0`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is a string and is not equal to 'E', a is a list of integers, the value of `i` is 'N', and the value of `rr[1]` is 0**
