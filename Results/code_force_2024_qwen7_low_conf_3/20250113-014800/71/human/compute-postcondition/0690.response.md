Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `pp` is either the previous value of `pp` plus `'R'` or a list with an additional element `'H'`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Additionally, if `rr[3]` is greater than 0, then if `rr[3]` is decreased by 1 and `r` is increased by 1, `pp` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1. If `hh[3]` is `hh_3 - 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the value it had before plus `'H'`.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after executing the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts, as well as the value of `rr[3]`.
