`result.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `result`. The initial value of `result` is an empty list, so after appending `'H'`, the list `result` becomes `['H']`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `t` is an integer, `result` is `['H']`, `count_north == count_south`, `count_east == count_west`, and the current value of `s[i]` is 'W'.**
