Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']` or `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if it was less than `h` and `ww % 2 == 1`, otherwise `r` is increased by 2 if it was less than `h`.***
