`pp` is a list that has either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`. The code appends `'R'` to the list `pp`. The length of `pp` is now 3 because it was initially either 2 or 3. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'R']` or `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.**
