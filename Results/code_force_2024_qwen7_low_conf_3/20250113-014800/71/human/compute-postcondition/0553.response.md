`pp` is a list that is being appended with the value `'R'`. The initial state includes that `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', 'W', or 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, the first element of `rr` is False, and `r` is 1. The code appends `'R'` to the list `pp`, so the length of `pp` increases by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `i` is not 'N' and `i` is not 'W' and `i` is not 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, the first element of `rr` is False, `r` is 1, `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`**
