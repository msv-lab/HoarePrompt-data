Postcondition: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [1, 0, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0] or [1, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 3 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `pp` is ['R', 'R'] or ['R', 'H']**

Explanation:
- If `r < h` (i.e., `2 < 1`), which is false, the if part does not execute, and the else part runs. In the else part, `ww` remains 3, `ee` remains 1, `rr` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` becomes `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` remains 2, `h` becomes 2, and `pp` becomes `['R', 'H']`.
- If the condition `r < h` is not true, i.e., `r >= h` (which is always true in this case since `r` is 2 and `h` is 1), the else part does not run, and the if part runs. In the if part, `ww` remains 3, `ee` remains 1, `rr` becomes `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` becomes 3, `h` remains 1, and `pp` becomes `['R', 'R']`.

Thus, the overall postcondition considers both scenarios.
