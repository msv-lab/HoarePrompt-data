`ww` is decremented by 1. Since the exact value of `ww` is not specified, we will consider the different possible values it could have had before the decrement and how this affects the other variables.

1. If `ww` was even (let's say `ww` was `2k`), then before the decrement, `ww` would have been `2k + 1`. After decrementing, `ww` becomes `2k`. According to the initial state, since `ww` is now even, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` becomes a list containing the element `'H'`.

2. If `ww` was odd (let's say `ww` was `2k + 1`), then before the decrement, `ww` would have been `2k + 2`. After decrementing, `ww` becomes `2k + 1`, which is odd. According to the initial state, since `ww` is now odd, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` becomes a list containing the element `'R'`.

Therefore, the output state depends on whether `ww` was initially even or odd:

- If `ww` was initially even, then `ww` is now odd, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`.
- If `ww` was initially odd, then `ww` is now even, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.

Since the exact initial value of `ww` is not given, we express the output state in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; if `ww` was initially even, then `ww` is now odd, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`; if `ww` was initially odd, then `ww` is now even, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.**
