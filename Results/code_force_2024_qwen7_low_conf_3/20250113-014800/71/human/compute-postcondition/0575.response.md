Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is a character, and the variables `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` are updated according to the following rules:
- If `i == 'W'`: 
  - If `ww` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to ['H']. 
  - If `ww` is false, then:
    - If `rr[3]` is true and `hh[3]` is true, `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to ['R']. 
    - Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains ['H']. 
  - Additionally, if `r < h + 1`, `hh[2]` is set to `x + 1`, `pp` is set to ['R'], and `r` is less than `h + 1`. 
  - Otherwise, `hh[2]` is set to `True`, `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, and `pp` remains ['H'].
- If `i != 'W'`:
  - If `i == 'E'`:
    - If `(ee - 1) % 2 == 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to ['R']. 
    - If `(ee - 1) % 2 == 0`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to ['H']. 
    - If `rr[2]` is false, then `rr[3]` is incremented by 1 if `rr[3]` is true, otherwise `pp` is set to ['H']. 
    - If `rr[2]` is true, the function does not change any variables.
  - If `i == 'N'`:
    - If `nn` was true, then `r` is incremented by 1 (if it was odd), `h` is incremented by 1 (since `nn` became even), and `pp` is set to ['H']. 
    - If `nn` was false, then if `rr[1]` is true, `pp` is set to ['R'], `h` remains unchanged, and `rr[1]` remains unchanged. 
    - If `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to ['H']. 
    - Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `rr[0]` is set to 1 and `pp` is set to ['R']. 
    - Otherwise, `hh[0]` is set to 2, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to ['H']. 
  - If `i == 'S'`:
    - If `ss` was true and odd, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to ['H']. 
    - If `ss` was true and even, then `r` is incremented by 1 (the previous value of `r`) and `pp` is set to ['R']. 
    - Otherwise, if `rr[0]` is false, then `r` is set to 1 and `pp` is set to ['R']. 
    - If `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains ['R']. 
    - If `r >= h`, then `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is incremented by 1.***
