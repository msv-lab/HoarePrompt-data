Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to 'W', `ww` is False, `State` is a string. If `rr[3]` is True, then `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is set to ['H']. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h` by 1, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains 'R'. If `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, then `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to ['H'].***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes based on the value of `rr[3]` and the relationships between the variables as described in the if and else parts.
