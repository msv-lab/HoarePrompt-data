Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. Depending on the original value of `ww`:
- If `ww` is True, `h` is either `h + 1` or `h`, `r` is either `r + 1` or `r`, `pp` is either a list containing its previous elements plus 'H' or a list containing its previous elements plus 'R', and `ww` is decreased by 1.
- If `ww` is False:
  - If `rr[3]` is True, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus 'R', `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` or remains as the original value plus 1 if `r >= h`, `ww` retains its value, `rr` is a list where the third element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.
  - If `rr[3]` is False, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` or remains as the original value plus 1 if `r >= h`, `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus 'R' if `r < h` or a list containing the previous value of `pp` followed by 'H' if `r >= h`, `ww` retains its value, `rr` is a list where the third element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.***
