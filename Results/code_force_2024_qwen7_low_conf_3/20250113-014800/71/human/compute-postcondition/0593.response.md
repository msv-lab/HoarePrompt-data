`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. `hh[2]` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1.**
