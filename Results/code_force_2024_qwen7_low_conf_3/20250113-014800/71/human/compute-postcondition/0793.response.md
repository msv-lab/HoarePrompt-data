Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is updated based on the previous `i`. If `i` equals 'S', then `s` is one more than its previous value. If `i` equals 'W', then `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged and `e` is increased by 1.***
