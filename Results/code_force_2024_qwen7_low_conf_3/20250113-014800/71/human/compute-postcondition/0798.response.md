The code `w += 1` increments the value of `w` by 1. According to the initial state, `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 1 if `i` is 'W'. Since the code only changes `w`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` remains unchanged unless `i` is 'N', `s` is one more than its previous value if `i` is 'S', `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 2 if `i` is 'W', and `e` is increased by 1 if `i` is neither 'S' nor 'W'.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` remains unchanged unless `i` is 'N', `s` is one more than its previous value if `i` is 'S', `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 2 if `i` is 'W', and `e` is increased by 1 if `i` is neither 'S' nor 'W'.**
