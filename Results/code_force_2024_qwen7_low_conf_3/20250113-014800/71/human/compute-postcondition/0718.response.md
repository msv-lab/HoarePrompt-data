Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` and `r` are incremented by 1 in case `nn % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1. `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'` if `nn % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `pp` is now `['H']`. `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration in both cases.***
