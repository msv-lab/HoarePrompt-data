`r` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[1]` was increased by 1, so it is now increased by 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `h`, and `pp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list with three elements, where the second element (rr[1]) is increased by 2; the states of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list with three elements, where the second element (rr[1]) is increased by 2; the states of `h` and `pp` remain unchanged.**
