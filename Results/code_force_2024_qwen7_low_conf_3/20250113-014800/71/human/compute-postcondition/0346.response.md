The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Since `h` was previously increased by either 1 or 2, now it will be increased by 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, `hh[0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, `hh[0]` is increased by 1**
