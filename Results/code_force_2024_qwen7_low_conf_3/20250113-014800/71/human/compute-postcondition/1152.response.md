Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the last character in `l`, `n` is the count of 'N' characters in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' characters in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' characters in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character (neither 'N', 'S', nor 'W') in `l`, `nn` is `n - s` if `n > s` else `0`, `ss` is `s - n` if `n <= s` else `0`, `ww` is `0`, `ee` is `e - w`. If the condition `nn % 2 == 1 or ss % 2 == 1 or ww % 2 == 1 or (ee % 2 == 1)` is true, the current output is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ww` is `0`, `ee` is an integer, `rr` is a list of four integers, `hh` is a list of four integers, `r` is an integer, `h` is an integer, `pp` is a list of strings, and if both `r` and `h` are non-zero, the function outputs the string formed by joining all elements of `pp`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.***
