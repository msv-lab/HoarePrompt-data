`pp` is a list that gets the string `'H'` appended to it. The value of `hh` is a list with its first element incremented by 1, `i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `h` is incremented by 1, and the values of `pp` remain unchanged except for the new element added. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh` is a list with its first element incremented by 1; `i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is incremented by 1; the list `pp` now contains the elements it originally had plus `'H'`.

Output State: **`hh` is a list with its first element incremented by 1; `i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is incremented by 1; the list `pp` now contains the elements it originally had plus `'H'`**.
