Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' characters, `n` is the count of 'N' characters in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' characters in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' characters in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' characters in `l`, `ww` is `w - e` if `w > e` else `0`, `ee` is `e - w` if `w > e` else `0`, `nn` is `n - s` if `n > s` else `0`, `ss` is `s - n` if `n <= s` else `0`, `r` is an integer representing the final count of 'R' moves, `h` is an integer representing the final count of 'H' moves, `pp` is a list of strings representing the sequence of moves, where each move is either 'R' or 'H'. If `nn % 2 == 1 or ss % 2 == 1 or ww % 2 == 1 or ee % 2 == 1`, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is the string formed by joining all elements of `pp`.**
