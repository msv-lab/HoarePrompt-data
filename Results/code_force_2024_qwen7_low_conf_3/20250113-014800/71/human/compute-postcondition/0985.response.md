`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', and the states of `h` and `pp` will adjust accordingly based on the value of `i`. The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. The values of `i` and `pp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `h` is increased by 1, `pp` remains unchanged**
