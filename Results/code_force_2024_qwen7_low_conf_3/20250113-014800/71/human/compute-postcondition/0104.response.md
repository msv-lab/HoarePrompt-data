`hh[2]` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `(hh[2])` is true, decrementing it by 1 will make it false. The values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', and `(hh[2])` is false.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', and `(hh[2])` is false**
