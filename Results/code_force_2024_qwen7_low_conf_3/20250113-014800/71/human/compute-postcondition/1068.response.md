`pp` is a list that initially contains the element `'R'`. The code snippet appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Therefore, the updated list `pp` will contain two elements: `'R'` and `'R'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is `['R', 'R']`**
