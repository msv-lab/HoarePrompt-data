`rr` is a list, and its second element (index 1) is incremented by 1. The first character of the string `l` is stored in the variable `i`. The variables `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. 

Therefore, the output state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `rr[1]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `rr[1]` is incremented by 1.**
