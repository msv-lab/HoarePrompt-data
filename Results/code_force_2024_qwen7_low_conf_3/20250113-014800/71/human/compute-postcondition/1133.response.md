`r` is incremented by 1, so `r` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 1, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R'].

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 1, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
