Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `r < h`, then `h`, `r`, `pp` is ['R'], `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is replaced with `r + 'H'`, `pp` is `pp` with an additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.***
