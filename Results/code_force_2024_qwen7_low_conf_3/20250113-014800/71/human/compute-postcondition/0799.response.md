`e` is incremented by 1 based on the initial conditions. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `w`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` remains unchanged unless `i` is 'N', `s` is one more than its previous value if `i` is 'S', `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 1 if `i` is 'W', and `e` is increased by 1.**
