`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The value of `i` is 'N', which does not match 'E', so `i` remains unchanged. The list `a` is not affected, `nn` remains unchanged because no operations are performed on it, and `h` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'E', `pp` contains the string 'H', `nn` % 2 == 0, and `h` is incremented by 1.**
