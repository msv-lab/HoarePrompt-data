`nn` is assigned the value `n - s`, which is `n - s` since `n` and `s` are known and `ss` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the last character in `l`, `n` is the count of 'N' characters in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' characters in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' characters in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character (neither 'N', 'S', nor 'W') in `l`, `nn` is `n - s`, and `ss` is `0`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the last character in `l`, `n` is the count of 'N' characters in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' characters in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' characters in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character (neither 'N', 'S', nor 'W') in `l`, `nn` is `n - s`, and `ss` is `0`.**
