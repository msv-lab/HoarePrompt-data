Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string.
- `i` is the first character of the remaining string.
- `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

### Loop Conditions:
- If `i == 'W'` and based on the value of `ww`:
  - If `ww` is True, `h` may be `h + 1` or `h`, `r` may be `r + 1` or `r`, `pp` may contain its previous elements plus 'H' or 'R', and `ww` is decreased by 1.
  - If `ww` is False, further conditions apply:
    - If `rr[3]` is True, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus 'R', `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` or remains as the original value plus 1 if `r >= h`, `ww` retains its value, `rr` is a list where the third element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.
    - If `rr[3]` is False, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` or remains as the original value plus 1 if `r >= h`, `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus 'R' if `r < h` or a list containing the previous value of `pp` followed by 'H' if `r >= h`, `ww` retains its value, `rr` is a list where the third element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'E'` and `ee` is true, `ee` is decreased by 1. Further conditions apply:
  - If `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'R'` appended, and `rr[2]` is reduced by 1.
  - If `hh[2]` is true, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is set to 0, `pp` is now `['H']`, and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1.
  - If `hh[2]` is false and `r < h`, `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is updated with `'R'`.
  - If `hh[2]` is false and `r >= h`, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is updated with `'H'` added, and `hh[3]` is incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 1`, `nn` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus `['R']`. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is `['H']`. If `rr[1]` is true, `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'` based on the comparison between `r` and `h`, `rr` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1. If `i != 'N'`, depending on the initial value of `ss`, either `h` is `h + 2` and `pp` is `['R', 'H']` if `ss` was initially odd, or `pp` is `['R']` if `ss` was initially even. Additionally, `r` is incremented by 1 under specific conditions:
  - If `ss` is non-zero, `r` is incremented by 1 if `ss` was initially even and by 1 if `ss` was initially odd.
  - If `ss` is zero, `r` is incremented by 1 if `rr[0]` is True and by 1 if `r < h`. In the latter case, `h` is also incremented by 1. `hh`'s second element is incremented by 1 if `hh[0]` is True, and `h` is incremented by 1 in this case.

### Determining the Next State:

Since we do not know the exact value of `i` or the initial values of the other variables (`ww`, `ee`, etc.), let's consider each possible scenario:

1. **If `i == 'W'` and `ww` is True:**
   - `h` may be `h + 1` or `h`
   - `r` may be `r + 1` or `r`
   - `pp` may be `pp + 'H'` or `pp + 'R'`
   - `ww` is decreased by 1.
   - `rr` and `hh` remain unchanged.

2. **If `i == 'W'` and `ww` is False:**
   - If `rr[3]` is True, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'R'`, and `rr[3]` is incremented by 1, `hh` is incremented by 1.
   - If `rr[3]` is False, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` or remains as the original value plus 1 if `r >= h`, `pp` is updated with `'R'` if `r < h` or `'H'` if `r >= h`, `rr[3]` is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.

3. **If `i == 'E'` and `ee` is True:**
   - `ee` is decreased by 1.
   - If `rr[2]` is True, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'R'`, and `rr[2]` is reduced by 1.
   - If `hh[2]` is True, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is set to 0, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1.
   - If `hh[2]` is false and `r < h`, `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is updated with `'R'`.
   - If `hh[2]` is false and `r >= h`, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is updated with `'H'`, and `hh[3]` is incremented by 1.

4. **If `i == 'N'`:**
   - If `nn % 2 == 1`, `nn` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is `pp + ['R']`.
   - Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is `['H']`.
   - If `rr[1]` is true, `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` is updated with `'R'` or `'H'` based on the comparison between `r` and `h`, `rr` is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.
   - If `i != 'N'`, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is `['H']` unless `ss` is zero, then `r` is incremented by 1 if `rr[0]` is True and by 1 if `r < h`.

Given the lack of specific values, we can generalize the state as follows:

### Generalized State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string.
- `i` is the first character of the remaining string.
- `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, except for the potential changes mentioned above.

### Final State:
State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**

This state will be adjusted based on the specific condition encountered in the loop during the current iteration.
