Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Depending on the condition `nn % 2 == 1` and the states of `rr[1]` and `hh[1]`, the following cases apply:
- If `nn % 2 == 1`, `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`.
- If `nn % 2 == 0`, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is now `['H']`.
- If `rr[1]` is true, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is now a list containing the element `'R'`.
- If `rr[1] is false and hh[1] is true`, `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'R']`.
- If `rr[1] is false, r < h`, `h` remains unchanged, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'R']`.
- If `rr[1] is false, r >= h`, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'H']`.**
