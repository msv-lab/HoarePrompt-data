`hh[0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `hh[0]` was not specified in the initial state, so we only know it has been incremented. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, and `r` is greater than or equal to `h`; `hh[0]` is incremented by 1.
