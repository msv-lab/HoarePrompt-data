Postcondition: ***`i` is a string, and `i` is not equal to 'W'. `a` is a list of integers. `ee`, `h`, and `pp` are as follows: if `i` equals 'E', and `rr[2]` is false, `ee` is 0, `h` is 1, `pp` is either ['R'] or ['H'], and if `r < h`, `rr[3]` is incremented by 1 and `r` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1` and `pp[3]` is incremented by 1. If `i` equals 'N', `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `nn` and `rr`, and `pp` is a list containing 'H' or ['R']. If `i` equals 'S', `i` remains 'S', `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'H', and `r` is either 1 more than its original value or greater than or equal to `h + 1`.***
