`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is 1, so it becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [-1, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R'].

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [-1, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R']**
