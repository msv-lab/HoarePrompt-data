Postcondition: ***`count_north` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n` and must have at least one character, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `count_south` is 0, `count_east` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character 'E' was encountered, `count_west` is 1 if the character 'W' was encountered, `i` is 1 if the character 'E' was encountered, otherwise `i` is 0, and the current character `char` in the string `s` is neither 'N' nor 'S'.***
