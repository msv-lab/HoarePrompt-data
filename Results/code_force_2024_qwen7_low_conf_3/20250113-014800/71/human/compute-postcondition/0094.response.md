The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`.

Based on the conditions in the problem statement:

- **Case_1**: If the conditions for returning 'NO' are met, the function returns 'NO'.
- **Case_2**: If the conditions for returning a string created by joining the elements in the list 'result', which contains 'R' and 'H' based on the values in `s`, are met, the function returns this string.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s`, and depending on certain conditions, return either 'NO' or a string created by joining elements from a list 'result' based on the values in `s`.
