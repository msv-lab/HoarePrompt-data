`h` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `h` is 1 (since no initial value was given, we assume it to be 0 initially). The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'E', the current value of `i` is 'N', the condition `(nn)` is true, and `(nn % 2 == 1)` is false, and `h` is 1.
