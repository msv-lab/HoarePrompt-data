`pp` is a list to which the value `'H'` is appended. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it, and `h` is increased by 1 but the specific value of `h` is not provided, so we keep it as `h` is increased by 1. The state of `pp` is updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
