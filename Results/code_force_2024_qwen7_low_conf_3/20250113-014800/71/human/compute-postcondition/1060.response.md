The code `rr[3] -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value at index 3 of the list `rr`. Initially, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. Subtracting 1 from the last element (index 3) changes its value to `-1`.

Therefore, the updated list `rr` becomes `[0, 0, 0, -1]`. The values of the other variables (`ww`, `ee`, `hh`, `r`, `h`, `pp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, -1], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
