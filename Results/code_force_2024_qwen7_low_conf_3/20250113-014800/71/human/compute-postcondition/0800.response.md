Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` remains unchanged unless `i` is 'N', `s` is one more than its previous value if `i` is 'S', `w` is the previous value of `w` plus 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is 'W', and `e` is increased by 1 regardless of the value of `i`.***
