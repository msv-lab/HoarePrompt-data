You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Depending on the conditions:
- If `i == 'W'` and based on the value of `ww`:
  - If `ww` is True, `h` may be `h + 1` or `h`, `r` may be `r + 1` or `r`, `pp` may contain its previous elements plus 'H' or 'R', and `ww` is decreased by 1.
  - If `ww` is False, further conditions apply:
    - If `rr[3]` is True, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus 'R', `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` or remains as the original value plus 1 if `r >= h`, `ww` retains its value, `rr` is a list where the third element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.
    - If `rr[3]` is False, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h` or remains as the original value plus 1 if `r >= h`, `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus 'R' if `r < h` or a list containing the previous value of `pp` followed by 'H' if `r >= h`, `ww` retains its value, `rr` is a list where the third element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'E'` and `ee` is true, `ee` is decreased by 1. Further conditions apply:
  - If `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'R'` appended, and `rr[2]` is reduced by 1.
  - If `hh[2]` is true, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is set to 0, `pp` is now `['H']`, and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1.
  - If `hh[2]` is false and `r < h`, `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is updated with `'R'`.
  - If `hh[2]` is false and `r >= h`, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is updated with `'H'` added, and `hh[3]` is incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 1`, `nn` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is the previous value of `pp` plus `['R']`. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is `['H']`. If `rr[1]` is true, `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'` based on the comparison between `r` and `h`, `rr` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1, and `hh` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1. If `i != 'N'`, depending on the initial value of `ss`, either `h` is `h + 2` and `pp` is `['R', 'H']` if `ss` was initially odd, or `pp` is `['R']` if `ss` was initially even. Additionally, `r` is incremented by 1 under specific conditions: 
  - If `ss` is non-zero, `r` is incremented by 1 if `ss` was initially even and by 1 if `ss` was initially odd.
  - If `ss` is zero, `r` is incremented by 1 if `rr[0]` is True and by 1 if `r < h`. In the latter case, `h` is also incremented by 1. `hh`'s second element is incremented by 1 if `hh[0]` is True, and `h` is incremented by 1 in this case.
```
for i in l:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
