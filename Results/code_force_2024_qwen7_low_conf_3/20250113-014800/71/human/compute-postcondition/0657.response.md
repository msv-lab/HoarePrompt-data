`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. All other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The value of `r` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains the value `'R'` appended to it.**
