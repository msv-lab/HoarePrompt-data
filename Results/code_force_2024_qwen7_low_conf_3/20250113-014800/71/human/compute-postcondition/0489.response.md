The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `h`, it is assumed to be 0 (as it is a common default value for such operations). After executing the code, `h` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`, and `hh[2]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is 0, `h` is 1**
