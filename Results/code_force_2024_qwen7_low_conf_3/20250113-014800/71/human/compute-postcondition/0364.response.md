`rr[1]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was previously (either 1 or 2) to 2. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `rr[1]` is 2.**
