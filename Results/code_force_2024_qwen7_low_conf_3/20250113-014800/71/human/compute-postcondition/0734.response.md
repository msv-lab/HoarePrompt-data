Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Depending on the condition `rr[1]` and `hh[1]`, the following cases apply:
- If `rr[1]` is true, `r` is one more than its value in the previous iteration, and `pp` is now a list containing the element `'R'`.
- If `rr[1]` is false, `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'H']` if `hh[1]` is true, or `h` remains unchanged, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'R']` if `r < h`, or `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'H']` if `r >= h`.**
