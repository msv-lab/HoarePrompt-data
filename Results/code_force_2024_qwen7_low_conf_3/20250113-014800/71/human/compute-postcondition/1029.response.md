The value of `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', and the states of `h` and `pp` will adjust accordingly based on the value of `i`. The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since the initial value of `h` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact new value, but we know it has been incremented by 1. The states of `i` and `pp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is incremented by 1; `pp` remains unchanged**
