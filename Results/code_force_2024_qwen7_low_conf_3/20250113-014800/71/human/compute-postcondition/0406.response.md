`w` is incremented by 1. Since `w` was initially 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'W', and 0 otherwise, the new value of `w` will be 2 if the next character in `l` is 'W', and 1 otherwise. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0; `m` is an input integer; `l` is a non-empty string; `n` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'N', and 0 otherwise; `s` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'S', and 0 otherwise; `w` is 2 if the next character in `l` is 'W', and 1 otherwise; `e` is 1 if the next character in `l` equals 'W' or 'N', and 0 otherwise; `ww` is 0; `ee` is 0; `nn` is 0; `ss` is 0; the character `i` is not equal to 'N'**
