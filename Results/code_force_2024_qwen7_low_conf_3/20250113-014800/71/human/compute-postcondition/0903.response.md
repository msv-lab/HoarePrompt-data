`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it means that `pp` is a new list created and appended with `'R'`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `rr[1]`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `a` is a list of integers, `rr[1]` is 0, `r` is 1, `pp` is a list containing ['R']**
