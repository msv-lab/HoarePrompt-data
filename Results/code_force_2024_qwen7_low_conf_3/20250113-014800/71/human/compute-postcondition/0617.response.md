Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `r < h`, then `h`, `r`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, the value at index 3 of `rr` is incremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'R'` in addition to its previous elements. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `pp` is a list with the additional element `'H'`, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `hh` is the same list with its fourth element incremented by 1.***
