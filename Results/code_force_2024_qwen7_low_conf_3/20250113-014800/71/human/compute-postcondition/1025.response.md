Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. `r` is either increased by 1 if `rr[1]` is true, or the first element of `rr` is increased by 2 if `hh[1]` is false and `r < h`. `h` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition. `pp` includes the elements `'H'` and `'R'` if applicable.***
