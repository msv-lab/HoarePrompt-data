The code appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to 'N' and the current value of `i` is not 'S', `h` is increased by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `pp` is ['H']**
