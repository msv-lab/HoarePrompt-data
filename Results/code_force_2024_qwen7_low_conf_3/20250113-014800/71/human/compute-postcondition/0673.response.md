`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The value of `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is its previous value plus 1, and `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is its previous value plus 1, `r`, `pp` is now `pp` with `'H'` appended, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
