Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 1, `s` and `w` are updated based on the next character in `l`, `e` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the next character in `l` is 'W' or not, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0, and the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N'. If the next character in `l` is 'W', `w` is increased by 1; otherwise, `n` is set to 1 and `e` is set to 2.**
