Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. If `rr[0]` is true, then `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H']. Otherwise, if `hh[0]` is true, then `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H']. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is increased by 2, `h` remains unchanged, and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains at least one element which is `'H'`.***
