The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The value of `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', and the values of `h` and `pp` adjust accordingly based on the value of `i`. The value of `r` is increased by 1. After appending `'R'` to `pp`, the list `pp` will contain the string `'R'`. The value of `i`, `h`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` and `pp` adjust accordingly based on the value of `i`; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is ['R']**
