Postcondition: ***`i` is a string. If `i` is 'W', then depending on the conditions, either `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is set to ['H'], `rr[2]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains 'R', or `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to ['H']. If `i` is not 'W', then `i` can be 'E', 'N', or 'S', and the states of `ee`, `h`, and `pp` will adjust accordingly based on the specific conditions provided for each case.***
