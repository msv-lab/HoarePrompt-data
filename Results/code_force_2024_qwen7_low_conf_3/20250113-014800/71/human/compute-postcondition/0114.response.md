The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `h` is not specified, but it is known that `r` is greater than or equal to `h`. The variable `hh` remains undefined. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, `hh` is undefined.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, `hh` is undefined**
