`rr[3]` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `rr[3]` is not specified. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string, currently equal to 'E', and not equal to 'W'; `a` is a list of integers; the condition `rr[2]` is still false; the value of `r` is less than `h`; `rr[3]` is its original value plus 1.
