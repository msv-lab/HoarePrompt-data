The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'`, `pp` will contain the element `'H'`.

- `i` remains a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'.
- `h` remains increased by 1 from its previous state.
- `a` remains a list of integers unchanged.
- `rr[2]` remains `false`.
- `hh[2]` remains `0` (or `False`).

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; `h` is increased by 1; `a` is a list of integers; `pp` is ['H']; `rr[2]` is false; `hh[2]` is 0 (False)**.
