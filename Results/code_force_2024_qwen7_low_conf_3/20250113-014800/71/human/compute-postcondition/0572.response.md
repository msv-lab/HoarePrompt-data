Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', and `i` is not 'N', 'W', or 'E'. If `ss` is true:
- If `ss` was initially odd, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is ['H'].
- If `ss` was initially even, `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1 and `pp` is ['R'].
Otherwise (`ss` is false):
- If `rr[0]` is False, then `r` is 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`.
- If `r` is less than `h`, then `rr[1]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains a list containing 'R'.
- If `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, then `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is increased by 1.***
