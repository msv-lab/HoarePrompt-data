Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, and `h`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. Depending on the value of `i`, the following cases apply:
- If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 1`, then `h` and `r` are incremented by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 0`, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is now `['H']`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is now a list containing the element `'R'`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is false and `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'R']`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is false, `r < h`, then `h` remains unchanged, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'R']`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is false, `r >= h`, then `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to `[previous pp values, 'H']`.
- If `i == 'S'`, then `h` is increased by 1. If `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'`. Otherwise, `r` retains its value and `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended.
- If `i != 'S'`, then depending on the condition `rr[0]`, `h` is `rr[0] + 1` and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`. Or if `hh[0]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'H'` appended, `hh[0]` is decreased by 1, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1. Or if `r < h`, then `pp` contains all previous elements plus `'R'`, `rr` is incremented by 1, and `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1. `ww`, `ee`, and `rr` retain their values from the previous iteration.***

This summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the if-else block executes, considering all possible cases for the value of `i`.
