`h` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh[1]`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh[1]` retain their values from the previous iteration.
