The code `rr[2] -= 1` decrements the value at index 2 of the list `rr` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the exact values of `rr`. Since the initial state does not give us the values of `rr`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `rr[2]`. But we know that the value at index 2 of `rr` is decreased by 1.

The states of the variables `i`, `h`, and `pp` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the list `rr`.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; the value of `rr[2]` is decreased by 1**
