Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a string, `n` is the count of 'N' characters in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' characters in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' characters in `l`, `e` is the count of any other characters in `l` that are neither 'N', 'S', nor 'W', `ww` is `w - e`, `ee` is `e - w`, `nn` is `n - s` if `n > s` else `s - n`, `ss` is 0 if `n > s` else `n - s`. If the condition `nn % 2 == 1 or ss % 2 == 1 or ww % 2 == 1 or (ee % 2 == 1)` is true, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `r` and `h` are determined based on the parity of `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss`, and the program prints the concatenated string of `pp` if both `r` and `h` are true; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
