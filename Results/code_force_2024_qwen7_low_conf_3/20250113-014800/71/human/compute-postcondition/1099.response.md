`pp` is a list that initially contains the element 'R'. The code snippet `pp.append('R')` adds another 'R' to the list `pp`. Therefore, the updated list `pp` will contain two 'R's.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R', 'R']**
