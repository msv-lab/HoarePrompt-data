`h` is increased by 1. The initial state tells us that `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, so after this operation, `h` will be increased by 1 (since adding 1 to either 1 or 2 results in 2 or 3 respectively). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1 (so `h` is now either 2 or 3), `pp` is either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, and `hh[1]` is decreased by 1.**
