`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The value of `i` and `h` remains unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is the original value of `h` plus 1; `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is the original value of `h` plus 1; `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`**
