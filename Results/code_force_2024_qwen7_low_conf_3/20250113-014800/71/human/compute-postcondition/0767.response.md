Postcondition: ***`l` is the empty string, `i` is an undefined character (since `l` is empty), `h` is the final value of `h` after processing all characters in `l`, `r` is the final value of `r` after processing all characters in `l`. If both `h` and `r` are true, the string `pp` is printed. Otherwise, the console outputs 'NO'. `pp` is the final list of characters representing the final state of `pp`, `ww` is the final value of `ww` after processing all characters in `l`, `ee` is the final value of `ee` after processing all characters in `l`, `nn` is the final value of `nn` after processing all characters in `l`, `ss` is the final value of `ss` after processing all characters in `l`, `rr` is the final list of integers representing the final state of `rr`, and `hh` is the final list of integers representing the final state of `hh`.***
