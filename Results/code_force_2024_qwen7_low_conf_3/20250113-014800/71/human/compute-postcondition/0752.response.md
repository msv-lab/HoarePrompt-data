The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated state of `h` is its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is incremented by 1, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; `hh[1]` is incremented by 1.**
