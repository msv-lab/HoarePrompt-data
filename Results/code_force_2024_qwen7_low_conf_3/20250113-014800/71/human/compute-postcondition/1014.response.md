The code `hh[1] -= 1` decrements the second element of the list `hh` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify what `hh` is, only that `i` could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. The values of `h` and `pp` will adjust accordingly based on the value of `i`. Since no direct assignment to `h` or `pp` is mentioned in the code, their values remain unspecified in the context of this code snippet. 

Given that `hh` is not initialized in the initial state and no specific value for `hh` is provided, we can only update the value of `hh` after the operation. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `hh`[1] is decreased by 1**
