`r` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The second element of the list `rr` is decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, so this change is still valid.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, the second element of `rr` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1.**
