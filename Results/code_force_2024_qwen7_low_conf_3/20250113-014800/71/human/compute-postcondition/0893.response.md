The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given initial state, we assume it is a new list that gets initialized when this line of code is executed. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `r`, and the condition `(nn)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string and is not equal to 'E', `a` is a list of integers, the current value of `i` is 'N', `r` is an integer that has been incremented by 1, and the condition (nn) is true with its current value being an odd number; pp is a list containing 'R'**
