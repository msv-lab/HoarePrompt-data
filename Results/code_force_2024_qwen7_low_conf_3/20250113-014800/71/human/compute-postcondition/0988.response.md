`ee` is decremented by 1. The value of `ee` can be any odd or even number. Depending on the original value of `ee`, `r` or `h` will be incremented by 1, and `pp` will be set to either `['R']` or `['H']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

- If `ee` was originally odd, then `r` was increased by 1, and `pp` is `['R']`.
- If `ee` was originally even, then `h` was increased by 1, and `pp` is `['H']`.

After decrementing `ee` by 1, we need to consider the new value of `ee`:
- If `ee` was originally odd and is now even, then `r` was increased by 1, and `pp` is `['R']`. Decrementing an odd number by 1 results in an even number.
- If `ee` was originally even and is now odd, then `h` was increased by 1, and `pp` is `['H']`. Decrementing an even number by 1 results in an odd number.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- If `ee` was originally odd and is now even, then `r` is `r + 1`, and `pp` is `['R']`.
- If `ee` was originally even and is now odd, then `h` is `h + 1`, and `pp` is `['H']`.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; if `ee` was originally odd and is now even, then `r` is `r + 1` and `pp` is `['R']; otherwise, if `ee` was originally even and is now odd, then `h` is `h + 1` and `pp` is `['H']`.**
