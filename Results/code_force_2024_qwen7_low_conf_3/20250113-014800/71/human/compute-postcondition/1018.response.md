The code `r += 1` increments the first element of the list `r` by 1. The initial state indicates that `r` is a list where the first element is increased by 1. After the code execution, the first element of `r` will be increased by 1 again.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr` is a list where the first element is increased by 2**
