`pp` is a list that contains the string 'R'. The code appends 'H' to the list `pp`. Therefore, the updated list `pp` will now contain both 'R' and 'H'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 2, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['R', 'H']**
