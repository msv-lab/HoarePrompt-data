The code `rr[1] -= 1` decrements the value at index 1 of the list `rr` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `rr`, only the possible values for `i`. The variables `h` and `pp` are not mentioned in the initial state and their values are not changed by the code.

Since the initial state of `i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', and no other variables are mentioned, we can assume that the only change is to the list `rr`.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `rr[1]` is the original value of `rr[1]` - 1**
