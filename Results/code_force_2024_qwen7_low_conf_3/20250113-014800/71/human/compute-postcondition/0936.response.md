`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not specified in the initial state. However, since `rr` is a list where the first element is `0`, and there's no indication that `r` is the same as `rr[0]`, we cannot assume `r` is `0`. The only change is that `r` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is not equal to 'N'; `rr` is a list where the first element is `0`; `r` is incremented by 1.**
