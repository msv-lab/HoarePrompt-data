`nn` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `nn` is not specified. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `nn`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1, 2, or 3, `pp` is one of `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, `['H', 'R', 'H']`, or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `nn` is decreased by 1.**
