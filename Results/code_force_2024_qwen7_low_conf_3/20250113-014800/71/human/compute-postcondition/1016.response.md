The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify the content of `pp`, we assume it is an empty list before the code is executed. After appending `'H'`, the list `pp` will contain the element `'H'`.

The variable `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The variable `h` is mentioned in the initial state as being increased by 1, but the exact value of `h` is not specified, so we only know that `h` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` has been increased by 1; `pp` is ['H']**
