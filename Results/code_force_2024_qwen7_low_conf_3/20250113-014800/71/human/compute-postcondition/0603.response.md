Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration; if `ee % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list containing all its previous elements plus 'R'. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` becomes `['H']`, and `r`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values.***
