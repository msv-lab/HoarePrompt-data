Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E'. If `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, `h` is greater than `r`, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'. Otherwise, `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, `hh` is undefined, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.***
