The code `pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `pp`, we can assume it is an empty list before this operation. After the operation, `pp` will contain the element `'H'`.

The other variables (`i`, `State`, `ww`, `hh[3]`, and `h`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is equal to 'W', `State` is a string, `i` is equal to 'W', `ww` is False, `hh[3]` is 0, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
