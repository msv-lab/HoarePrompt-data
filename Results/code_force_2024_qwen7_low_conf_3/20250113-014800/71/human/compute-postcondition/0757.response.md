Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `ss` is true, then:
- `h` is increased by 1,
- if `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'`,
- otherwise, `r` retains its value and `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended,
- `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration.

If `ss` is false, then:
- Depending on the condition `rr[0]`, either `h` is `rr[0] + 1` and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`,
- or if `hh[0]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is updated with `'H'` appended, `hh[0]` is decreased by 1, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1,
- or if `r < h`, then `pp` contains all previous elements plus `'R'`, `rr` is incremented by 1, and `r` is incremented by 1,
- otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1.
- `ww`, `ee`, and `rr` retain their values from the previous iteration.***
