`ss` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `ss` is not given, so we cannot determine its exact new value, but we know it has decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is one of the following: `['H', 'R', 'R']`, `['H', 'H', 'R']`, or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `ss` is decreased by 1.
