Postcondition: ***`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is either `[0, 0, 0, 1]` or `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is either `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `r` is 3 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `pp` is either `['R', 'R']` or `['R', 'H']`***

Explanation:
- If `hh[2]` is `True`, then `hh` is updated to `[0, 0, -1, 0]`, `r` is updated to 2, and `h` is updated to 2. Additionally, `pp` is updated to `['R', 'H']`.
- If `hh[2]` is `False`, then `rr` is updated to `[0, 0, 0, 1]` (or remains as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`), `hh` is updated to `[0, 0, 0, 1]` (or remains as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`), `r` is updated to 3, `h` is updated to 1, and `pp` is updated to `['R', 'R']`.

Combining both cases, we get the overall postcondition as described above.
