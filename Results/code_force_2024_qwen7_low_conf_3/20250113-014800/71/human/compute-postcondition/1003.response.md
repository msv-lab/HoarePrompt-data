Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. If `rr[2]` is True, then `rr[2]` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to ['R']. Otherwise, if `hh[2]` is True, then `hh[2]` is decreased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to ['H']. If `r < h`, then `rr`'s fourth element is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `h` and `pp` remain unchanged with `pp` being ['R']. If `r >= h`, then `h` is set to `hh[3] + 1` and `pp` is set to `[hh[3] + 1, 'H']***
