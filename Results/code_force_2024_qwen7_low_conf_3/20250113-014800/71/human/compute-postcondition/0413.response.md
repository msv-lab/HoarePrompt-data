`s` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 2 if the next character in `l` equals 'N' and 1 otherwise, `s` and `w` are updated based on the next character in `l`, `e` is 1 if the next character in `l` is 'W' or 'N', otherwise `e` is 0, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0, and the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N'. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 1 (since the next character in `l` is not 'N'), `s` is a positive integer (specifically, `s+1`), `w` is updated based on the next character in `l`, `e` is 1, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0, and the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N'.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 1, `s` is `s + 1`, `w` is updated based on the next character in `l`, `e` is 1, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, and `ss` remain 0, and the next character in `l` is not equal to 'N'**
