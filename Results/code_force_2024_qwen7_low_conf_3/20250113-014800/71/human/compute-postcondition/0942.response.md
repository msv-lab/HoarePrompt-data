The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'` to `pp`, the list `pp` now contains `'H'`.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'N', `hh[0]` is 0, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['H']**
