Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp` is now `['H']`, and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `h` retains its value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'R'` in addition to its previous elements. If `r >= h`, then `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is a list with the additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` is incremented by 1.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, summarizing the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else statement based on the given conditions.
