The code appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list initially. After appending 'R', `pp` becomes `['R']`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `ee`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is a string, not equal to 'W', and currently equal to 'E'; `a` is a list of integers; the value of `ee` is true and odd; `r` is incremented by 1; `pp` is `['R']`**
