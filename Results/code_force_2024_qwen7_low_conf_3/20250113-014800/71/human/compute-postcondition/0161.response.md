`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', and the condition `ss` is true and not odd. The value of `ss` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `ss` is true and not odd, and `h` is the original value of `h` plus 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `ss` is true and not odd, `h` is the original value of `h` plus 1**
