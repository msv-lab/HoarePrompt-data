Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `rr[0]` is True, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the value `'R'` appended to it. Otherwise, `r` is incremented by 1 if `r < h`, `h` is incremented by 1 if `r >= h`, and `hh` has its second element incremented by 1 if `hh[0]` is True, with `h` also incremented by 1 in this case.**
