Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', 'W', or 'E'. The condition `(ss)` is false. If `rr[0]` is False, `r` is 1, `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, `rr[1]` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains a list containing 'R'. If `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is increased by 1.***
