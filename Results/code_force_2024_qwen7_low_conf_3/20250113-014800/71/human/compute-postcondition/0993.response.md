`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `hh[2]` is decreased by 1, and the values of `i`, `h`, and `pp` are not specified in the initial state, so they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `hh[2]` is decreased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S', `hh[2]` is decreased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` remains unchanged.**
