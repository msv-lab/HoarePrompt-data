The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is not explicitly defined, but since it's being modified, we assume `r` was previously 0 (the default value for integers in Python when not initialized). After executing the code, `r` becomes 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], `rr[3]` is false, `rr[0]` is 1, `r` is 1**
