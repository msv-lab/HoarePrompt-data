The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The previous state was that `r` retained its value from the previous iteration, and now it is increased by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration except `r` which is increased by 1, the value at index 2 of `rr` is decreased by 1.**
