Postcondition: ***`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h`, `r`, `pp`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the value `'R'` appended to it. Otherwise, `hh` is the list with its second element incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended.***
