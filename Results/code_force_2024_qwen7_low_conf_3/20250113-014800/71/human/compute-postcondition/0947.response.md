The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, it means `pp` is a new list created and initialized with the element `'R'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string and is equal to 'S', `a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 'N', `rr[0]` is False, `rr[1]` is 1, `r` is an integer that is 1 more than its original value, `pp` is a list containing ['R']**
