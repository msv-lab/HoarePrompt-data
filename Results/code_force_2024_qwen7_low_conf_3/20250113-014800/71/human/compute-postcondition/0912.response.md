`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as a string and is not equal to 'E'. The value of `a` remains a list of integers. The condition `r < h` is initially true, and after incrementing `r` by 1, the new condition would be `r+1 < h`, which is still true because adding 1 to a number that was less than another number keeps it less than that number.

Output State: **`i` is a string and is not equal to 'E', `a` is a list of integers, `rr[0]` is increased by 1, r is increased by 1, the condition r+1 < h is true.**
