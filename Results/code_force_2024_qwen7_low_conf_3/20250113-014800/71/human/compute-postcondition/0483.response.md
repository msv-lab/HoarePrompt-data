The code `rr[2] -= 1` decrements the value at index 2 of the list `rr` by 1. Given the initial state where `rr[2]` is `True`, we need to consider that in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1`. So, `rr[2]` will be decremented from `1` to `0`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', and `rr[2]` is False**
