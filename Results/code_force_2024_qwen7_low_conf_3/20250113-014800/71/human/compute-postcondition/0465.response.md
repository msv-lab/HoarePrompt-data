The code `pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since no initial value for `pp` was given, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After executing this line, the list `pp` will contain the element `'H'`.

All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is false, the fourth element of `rr` is false, `hh[3]` is false, `hh[2]` is `True`, `h` is increased by 1, and the relation `r >= h` holds; `pp` is a list containing `'H'`.**
