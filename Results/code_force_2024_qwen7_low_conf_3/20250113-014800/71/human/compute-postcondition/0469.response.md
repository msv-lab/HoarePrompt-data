Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'W'. If `ww` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is ['H']. If `ww` is false, then depending on the state of `rr[3]` and `hh[3]`, either `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` becomes ['R'], or `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains as ['H']. If `r < h`, then `hh[2]` is set to `x + 1`, `pp` becomes ['R'], and `r` is less than `h + 1`. Otherwise, if `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh[2]` becomes `True`, `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, and `pp` remains as ['H'].***
