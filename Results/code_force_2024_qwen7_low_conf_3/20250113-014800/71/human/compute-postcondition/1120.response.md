The value of `r` is incremented by 1. Initially, `r` is 2, so after the increment, `r` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R'].

Output State: **`ww` is 3, `ee` is 1, `rr` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `r` is 3, `h` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
