`ee` is decremented by 1. The value of `ee` can either make `r` or `h` increase depending on its parity (odd or even). Since the exact value of `ee` is not specified, we cannot determine whether `r` or `h` will be incremented. However, we know that `ee` has been decreased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `pp` is either ['R'] or ['H'], if `(ee - 1) % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1, if `(ee - 1) % 2 == 0`, then `h` is increased by 1.**
