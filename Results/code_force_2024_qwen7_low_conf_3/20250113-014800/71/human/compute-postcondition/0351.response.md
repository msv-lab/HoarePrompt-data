Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1, 2, or 3, `pp` is a list where the first element is 'H'. Depending on the value of `rr[1]`, the second element of `pp` is 'R' or 'H'. If `rr[1]` is true, `pp[1]` is 'R' or 'H', depending on whether `r < h` or `r >= h`. If `rr[1]` is false, `pp[1]` is 'R' if `r < h` and 'H' if `r >= h`. `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`. Additionally, `nn` is decreased by 1 in the if part.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes of both the if and else parts of the if-else block, considering the different conditions and their effects on the variables.
