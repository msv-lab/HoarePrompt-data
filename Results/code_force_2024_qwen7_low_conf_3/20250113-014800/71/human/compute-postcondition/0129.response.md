Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `pp` is either ['R'] if `(nn % 2 == 1)` is true (i.e., `nn` is odd), or ['H'] if `(nn % 2 == 1)` is false (i.e., `nn` is even). Additionally, if `(nn % 2 == 1)` is true, `r` is incremented by 1, and if `(nn % 2 == 1)` is false, `h` is set to 1. The condition `(nn)` remains true.***
