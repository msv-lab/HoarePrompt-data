`pp` is a list that appends the value 'H' to itself. The previous value of `pp` is not specified, so we only know that it gets an additional element 'H'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp` now includes 'H', `ww`, `ee`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `hh[0]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is `hh[0] - 1, hh[1:], i, l, r, ww, ee, rr, hh` with 'H' appended, `hh[0]` is decreased by 1**
