Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is a list where the first element is 'H'. If `rr[1]` is true, the second element of `pp` is 'R' or 'H', depending on whether `r < h` or `r >= h`. If `rr[1]` is false, the second element of `pp` is 'R' if `r < h` and 'H' if `r >= h`, and `hh[0]` is increased by 1. `rr[3]` remains false, and `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`. Additionally, `rr[1]` is decreased by 1 in the if part.***
