`h` is incremented by 1, which means `h` becomes `h + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, and `r` is greater than or equal to `h`; `hh[0]` is incremented by 1, and `h` is `h + 1`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, `rr[1]` is false, and `r` is greater than or equal to `h`; `hh[0]` is 2, and `h` is `h + 1`**.
