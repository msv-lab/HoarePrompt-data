Postcondition: **`i` is a string. If `i` equals 'N', `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `nn` and `rr`, and `pp` is a list containing 'H' or ['R']. If `i` equals 'S', `i` remains 'S', `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'H', and `r` is either 1 more than its original value or greater than or equal to `h+1`.**
