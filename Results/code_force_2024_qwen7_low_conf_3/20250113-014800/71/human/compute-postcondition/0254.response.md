`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The initial state is given as `pp` being `['H']`. After appending `'H'`, the list `pp` will be `['H', 'H']`.

The other variables (`l`, `h`, `hh[0]`, and `rr[3]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 1 from its initial value, `pp` is `['H', 'H']`, `hh[0]` is the initial value of `h` plus 1, `rr[3]` is false**
