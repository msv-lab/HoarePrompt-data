`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Given that `pp` is initially either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, after appending `'R'`, `pp` will become `['H', 'R', 'R']` if it was `['H', 'R']` initially, or `['H', 'H', 'R']` if it was `['H', 'H']` initially. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either ['H', 'R', 'R'] or ['H', 'H', 'R'], `rr[3]` is -1, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`**
