The code appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. However, the initial state does not specify what `pp` is, so we assume it is an empty list before the code execution. After executing `pp.append('H')`, the list `pp` will contain the element 'H'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is 'W', `ww` is true and even, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
