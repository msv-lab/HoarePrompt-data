Postcondition: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `ee` is `ee_initial - 1`. If `ee_initial` was odd, `h` and `r` are each increased by 1, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus `'R'`. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains `'H'` as the last element. If `rr[2]` is greater than 0, `pp` has one additional element `'R'`, `r` is increased by 1, and `rr[2]` is decreased by 1. If `hh[2]` is true, `h` is `hh[2] + 1`, `pp` contains `'H'` as the last element, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1. If `r < h`, `h` remains unchanged, `r` is replaced with `r + 'H'`, `pp` is `pp` with an additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` remains unchanged. If none of the above conditions are met, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is replaced with `r + 'H'`, `pp` is `pp` with an additional element `'H'`, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.**
