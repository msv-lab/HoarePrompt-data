`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is a list with the additional element `'H'`, `ww` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, and `hh` retains its value from the previous iteration.
