`r` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `r` was less than `h`, so after incrementing, `r` is now one more than its previous value, which is still less than `h`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 'W', `State` is a string, `i` is 'W', `ww` is False, `rr[3]` is False, `hh[3]` is False, `r` is less than `h` by 1, and `rr[2]` is incremented by 1.**
