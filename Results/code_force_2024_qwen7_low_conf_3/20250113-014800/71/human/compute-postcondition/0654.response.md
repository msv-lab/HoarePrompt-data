`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is `hh[0] + 1`, `r`, `pp` is ['H'], `ww`, `rr`, and `hh` retain their values from the previous iteration, `hh[0]` is decreased by 1.**
