Postcondition: ***`i` is a string that could be 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'. Depending on the value of `i`:
- If `i` is 'S', and the original `ss` was odd and now even, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.
- If the original `ss` was even and now odd, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list containing 'R'.
- If `rr[0]` is true, then `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H'].
- If `hh[0]` is true, then `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H'].
- If `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is increased by 2, `h` remains unchanged, and `pp` is ['R'].
- Otherwise, `hh[1]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains at least one element which is 'H'.
- Since there is no else part, the conditions above cover all possible scenarios.***
