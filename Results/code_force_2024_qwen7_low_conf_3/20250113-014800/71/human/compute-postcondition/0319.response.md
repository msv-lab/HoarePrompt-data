`pp` appends `'H'` to the list. Since `pp` was either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, after appending `'H'`, `pp` will be either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 2 or 3, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, `hh[2]` is decreased by 1.
