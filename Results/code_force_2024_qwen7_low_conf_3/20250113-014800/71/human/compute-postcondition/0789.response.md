`s` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `i` and its effects on `n`, `s`, `w`, and `e` are not specified. The only change is that `s` is now one more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is updated based on the previous `i`, `s` is one more than its previous value, `w` is updated based on the previous `i`, `e` is updated based on the previous `i`**
