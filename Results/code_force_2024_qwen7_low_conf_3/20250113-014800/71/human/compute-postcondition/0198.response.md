`ww` is decremented by 1. The value of `ww` before this operation can be any integer, but it is known that if `ww % 2 == 1`, then `r` was increased by 1. After decrementing `ww`, its parity (whether it is odd or even) changes. If `ww` was odd, it becomes even, and if it was even, it becomes odd. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by either 1 or 2, `pp` is either ['H', 'R'] or ['H', 'H'], `rr[3]` remains false, `ww` is decreased by 1.**
