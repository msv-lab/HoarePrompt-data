`ss` is decremented by 1, which means the new value of `ss` is `ss - 1`. However, the initial state does not provide the exact value of `ss`, only that it is true and its value is odd or even. The operation `ss -= 1` will make `ss` either even (if it was initially odd) or odd (if it was initially even). The value of `l`, `i`, `r`, `h`, and `pp` are not directly affected by this operation, except for the fact that `ss` changes. 

Given the initial conditions:
- If `(ss)` is true and its value is odd, then `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'.
- If `(ss)` is true and its value is even, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.

Since `ss` is now `ss - 1`, if `ss` was initially odd, it is now even, and if it was initially even, it is now odd. Based on this, the logic of the initial conditions changes accordingly:
- If `ss` was initially odd, it is now even, so `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.
- If `ss` was initially even, it is now odd, so `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'.

Since we cannot specify the exact value of `ss` before the operation, we consider both cases:
- If `ss` was initially odd, now `ss` is even, so `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].
- If `ss` was initially even, now `ss` is odd, so `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, and `pp` is ['R'].

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', and `i` is not 'N', 'W', or 'E', `ss` is `ss - 1`, if `ss` was initially odd then `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is ['H'], else if `ss` was initially even then `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1 and `pp` is ['R'].**
