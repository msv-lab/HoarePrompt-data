`pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect the values of `l`, `i`, `h`, `r`, `ww`, `rr`, and `hh`. The value of `hh[3]` remains `h - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r`, `pp` contains the element `'H'` appended to its previous elements, `ww` retains its value from the previous iteration, `rr` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `hh[3]` is decreased by 1 and is now equal to `h - 1`.

Output State: **`l` is the string obtained by removing the first character from the original non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the remaining string, `h` is increased by 1, `r` retains its value, `pp` is the list with `'H'` appended, `ww` retains its value, `rr` retains its value, and `hh[3]` is equal to `h - 1`.**
