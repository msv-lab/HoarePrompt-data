`pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` can be either `['H', 'R']` or `['H', 'H']`, appending `'H'` to both possibilities results in `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `h` is increased by 2, `pp` is either `['H', 'R', 'H']` or `['H', 'H', 'H']`, `rr[3]` remains false, `r` is increased by 1 if `r < h`, `hh[0]` is increased by 1**
