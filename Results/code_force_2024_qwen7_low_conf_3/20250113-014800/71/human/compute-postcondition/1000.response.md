`pp` is a list that appends the value `'H'`. Initially, `pp` contains the value that `h` is set to, which is `hh[3] + 1`. After executing `pp.append('H')`, the list `pp` will include both its original value and the new value `'H'`.

Output State: **`i` is 'W', 'E', 'N', or 'S'; `h` is `hh[3] + 1`; `pp` is `[hh[3] + 1, 'H']`**
