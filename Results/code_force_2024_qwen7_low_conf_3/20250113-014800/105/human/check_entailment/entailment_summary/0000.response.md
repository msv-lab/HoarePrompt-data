Reasoning:  
The given program seems to follow the logic to solve the problem correctly. Here's the breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`.
3. **Constructing Cumulative Sums**: It constructs a list `a` with cumulative sums of the elements. This list is built by iterating through the sorted elements of the array and updating the cumulative sum.
4. **Computing Maximum Value**: It calculates the maximum value of the expression \( \max(2 \cdot a[\max(i, x) - x] - a[i]) \) for \( i \) ranging from \( n - k \) to \( n \). This expression aims to find the best possible outcome for Alice and Bob given their constraints.
5. **Printing Results**: It prints the result for each test case.

The logic behind the expression \( \max(2 \cdot a[\max(i, x) - x] - a[i]) \) is to consider the best way to maximize the sum after Alice and Bob make their moves. By sorting the array and using cumulative sums, the program ensures that it can efficiently find the optimal removal and negation strategies.

Given the explanation and the logical steps, the program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
