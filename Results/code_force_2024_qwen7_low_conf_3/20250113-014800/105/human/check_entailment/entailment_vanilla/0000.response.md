### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` which define the size of the array, the number of elements Alice can remove, and the number of elements Bob can negate, respectively.
   
2. **Array Initialization and Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is initialized with `[0]` and populated by sorting the elements from the input. This step is crucial because it allows us to later use cumulative sums efficiently.

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The code computes cumulative sums (`a`) such that `a[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the original array.
   - This is achieved by iterating through the sorted array and updating the cumulative sum list `a`.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Alice and Bob**:
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the sum of the array after removing up to `k` elements.
   - Bob's goal is to minimize the sum of the array after negating up to `x` elements.
   - To achieve this, the algorithm calculates the maximum possible sum under these constraints:
     - It iterates over the range `n - k` to `n` (inclusive), considering different positions where Alice can stop adding elements to the cumulative sum.
     - For each position `i`, it calculates the potential new sum if Bob negates `x` elements starting from the end of the array up to index `i`.
     - The key insight is that Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements, and Bob should negate the largest `x` elements.

5. **Maximizing the Final Sum**:
   - The expression `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` calculates the new sum after Alice removes elements and Bob negates elements optimally.
   - The `max(i, x)` ensures that Bob can negate at least `x` elements, even if some of them are already removed by Alice.
   - The `a[i]` term subtracts the cumulative sum up to index `i` from `2 * a[max(i, x) - x]`, which accounts for the optimal negations by Bob.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum possible sum for each test case, which is calculated according to the optimal strategies for both players.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the sum of the array after both players have played their moves optimally.

**Correctness: True**
