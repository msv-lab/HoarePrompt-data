To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and analyze each variable:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` (where `i + 1 < n`), meaning the current value of `i` is one more than the value it had in the previous iteration.
   - `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `l` is either `0` or `n - x` (the specific value of `l` is not relevant to the next iteration since the condition only depends on `i` and `n`).
   - `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution.
   - `p` is `-10`.
   - The list `q` now includes its original elements plus the new element `q[-1] + a[i]`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its previous value to ensure `i + 1 < n` holds true.
   - `n` remains unchanged as long as it is still greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `l` does not change for the next iteration unless explicitly stated otherwise.
   - `m` is determined during the loop execution, so it remains the same.
   - `p` remains `-10` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The list `q` will include its original elements plus the new element `q[-1] + a[i]`. Since `i` is incremented, the new element added to the list is `q[-1] + a[i + 1]`.

Based on these points, we can conclude the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` becomes `i + 2` (since it was `i + 1` before and needs to be incremented again).
- `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to `k`).
- `l` remains the same (either `0` or `n - x`).
- `m` remains the same.
- `p` remains `-10`.
- The list `q` now includes its original elements plus the new element `q[-1] + a[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `n - x`, `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i + 1]` encountered during the loop execution, `p` is `-10`, and the list `q` now includes its original elements plus the new element `q[-1] + a[i + 1]`.**
