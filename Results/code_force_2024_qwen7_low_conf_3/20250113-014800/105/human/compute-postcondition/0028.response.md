`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `R()`. Since the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified, the only thing we know is that these new values have replaced the previous values of `t` which was truthy and has been decremented by 1. The state of `t` being truthy and decremented by 1 is no longer relevant.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from `R()`, and `t` is no longer relevant.**
