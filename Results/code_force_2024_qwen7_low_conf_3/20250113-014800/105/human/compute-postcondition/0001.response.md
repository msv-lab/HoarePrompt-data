`t` is assigned the value returned by the lambda function `R()`, which reads input and returns it as a tuple of integers. Since `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and the code only assigns the first element of the tuple (which corresponds to `t`) to `t`, the output state is: `t` is now the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output State: **`t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
