The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The values of `i` and `l` are not affected by this code since they are not mentioned in the assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `n - x`, depending on whether `i - x < 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution, `p` is equal to `m` if `m > p` during each iteration, and `p` is printed, `k` is the second input integer, `x` is the third input integer.**
