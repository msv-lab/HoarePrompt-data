To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to consider how the loop variable `y` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 0
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`
- `x` is a value returned by `R()`
- `a` is `[0, y, 2 * y]`

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for y in sorted(R()):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the values generated by the function `sorted(R())`.
   - `y` takes on values in sorted order from the sequence produced by `R()`.

2. **Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` has taken on its current value (let's call it `y_current`).
   - Since the loop is in its next iteration, `y` must take on the next value in the sorted sequence, which we'll call `y_next`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - `t` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `n` remains the same since it was determined at the start of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `k` remains the same since it was determined at the start of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `x` remains the same since it was determined at the start of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `a` is a list containing `0`, `y`, and `2 * y`. After the previous iteration, `a` contains `[0, y_current, 2 * y_current]`. For the next iteration, `a` will be `[0, y_next, 2 * y_next]`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `t` is still 0.
- `n` is still a value returned by `R()`.
- `k` is still a value returned by `R()`.
- `x` is still a value returned by `R()`.
- `a` is now `[0, y_next, 2 * y_next]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, y_next, 2 * y_next]`**
