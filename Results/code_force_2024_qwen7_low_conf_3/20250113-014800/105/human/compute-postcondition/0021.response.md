The code snippet updates the list `a` by adding the last element of `a` plus `y`. Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, `a` is `[0, y]`, where `y` is the next value from `sorted(R())`.
2. The code `a += a[-1] + y` means that `a` is updated to include the value of `a[-1] + y` at the end of the list.

Given that `a` initially is `[0, y]`, `a[-1]` is `y`. Therefore, the new value to append to `a` is `y + y`, which simplifies to `2 * y`.

Thus, after executing the code, `a` becomes `[0, y, 2 * y]`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, y, 2 * y]`**
