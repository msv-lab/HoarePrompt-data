To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `m` and `p` are integers.
   - If `m` is greater than `p`, then `p` remains unchanged and is still equal to `m`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

From the for loop, we know:
- The loop iterates over the range from `n - k` to `n` inclusive.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- We know the condition `m > p` was met, meaning `p` remained unchanged and is still equal to `m`.

To proceed to the next iteration, we need to consider:
- The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- Whether the loop condition (`n - k <= i < n + 1`) allows for another iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts at `n - k` and ends at `n`.
   - If `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, it would be `n` (since `n + 1` is the upper bound).

2. **Determine if Another Iteration is Possible:**
   - The next value of `i` would be `n - 1` (since `i` increments by 1 each iteration).
   - Check if `n - 1` falls within the range `[n - k, n)`.

Given the loop's range:
- For the loop to continue, `n - 1` must be within the range `[n - k, n)`.
- This means `n - k <= n - 1 < n`, which simplifies to `k >= 1`.

If `k >= 1`, the loop can continue with `i = n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `m` and `p` remain unchanged as per the condition `m > p`.
- The new value of `i` will be `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`m` and `p` are integers where `m` > `p`, `i` is `n - 1`**.
