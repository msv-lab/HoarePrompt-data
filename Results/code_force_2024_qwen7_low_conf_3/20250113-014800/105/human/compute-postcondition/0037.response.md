Output State: **`a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of all elements in `R()` up to that point, and `y` is the last element of the sorted `R()` list, the print statement outputs the maximum value of the expression `max(2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i] for i in range(n - k, n + 1))` based on the current values of `a`, `x`, `n`, and `k`.**
