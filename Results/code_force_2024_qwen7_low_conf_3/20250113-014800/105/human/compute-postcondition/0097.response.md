Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer. `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to `k`. `l` is either `0` or `n - x`. `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution. `p` is `-10`. The list `q` contains `n + 1` elements where each element starting from the original elements up to the last element is computed as `q[-1] + a[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. If `i - x < 1`, then `i` is less than `x + 1`. Otherwise, `i` is `n - k` and `l` is `(n - k) - x`.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that the overall state of the program after the if-else block is accurately described.
