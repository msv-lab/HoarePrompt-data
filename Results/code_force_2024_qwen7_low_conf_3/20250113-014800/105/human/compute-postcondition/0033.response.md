The code `a += a[-1] + y` appends the value of `a[-1] + y` to the list `a`. Here, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, which is `an + y_val` according to the initial state. Therefore, the new element added to the list `a` will be `(an + y_val) + y`.

Let's update the list `a`:

- Initial list: `a = [a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val]`
- After executing the code: `a = [a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val, (an + y_val) + y]`

Thus, the updated list `a` will be `[a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val, an + y_val + y]`.

Output State: **`a` is `[a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val, an + y_val + y]`**
