According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero (True in a boolean context), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero.

Given that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), this constraint does not directly affect the condition inside the `while` loop. The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`.

State: **`t` must be non-zero (True)**
