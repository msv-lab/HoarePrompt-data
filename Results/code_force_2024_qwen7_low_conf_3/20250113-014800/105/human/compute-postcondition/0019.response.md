The code snippet `a += a[-1] + y,` modifies the list `a`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `a` is initially `[0]`.
2. `a[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `a`, which is `0`.
3. The value of `y` is not specified in the initial state, so let's denote it as `y`.
4. The operation `a += a[-1] + y` adds `a[-1] + y` to the end of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `0`
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`
- `x` is a value returned by `R()`
- `a` is `[0]`
- `sorted(R())` must contain at least one element

After executing the code:
- `a` will be `[0, 0 + y]` or `[0, y]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, y]`, `sorted(R())` must contain at least one element.**
