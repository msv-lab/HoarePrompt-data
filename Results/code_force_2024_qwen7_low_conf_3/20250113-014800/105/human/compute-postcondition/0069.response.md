Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - k`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `(n - k) - x`, `m` is either `2 * q[0] - q[n - k]` or `2 * q[(n - k) - x] - q[n - k]`. If `m > p`, then `p = m`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `m`, and `p` remain as they were before the if statement.***
