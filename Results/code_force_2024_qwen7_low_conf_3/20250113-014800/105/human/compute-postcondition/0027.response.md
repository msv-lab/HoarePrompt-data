The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. For the loop to continue, `t` must remain truthy. Decrementing `t` by 1 means that `t` will now be one less than its previous value. Since the loop continues as long as `t` is truthy, decrementing `t` by 1 does not immediately make it falsy unless `t` was 1 before this operation. 

Therefore, after executing `t -= 1`, `t` will be one less than its previous value, but we cannot determine the exact new value of `t` without knowing its original value. However, we know that `t` must still be truthy for the loop to continue.

Output State: **`t` is truthy and has been decremented by 1**
