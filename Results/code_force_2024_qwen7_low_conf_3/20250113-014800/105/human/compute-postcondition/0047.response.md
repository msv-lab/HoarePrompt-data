The code snippet appends the value of `q[-1] + a[i]` to the list `q`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is a positive integer
- `i` is `n - k - 1`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `n` is greater than `i`
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
- `q` is `[0]`
- `p` is `-10`

Let's analyze the impact:

1. `q` initially contains `[0]`.
2. `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])`: Here, `q[-1]` is `0`, and `a[i]` is an element from the list `a` at index `i`. Therefore, `q[-1] + a[i]` is `0 + a[i]`, which is just `a[i]`.

So, after executing the code, `q` becomes `[0, a[i]]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is `[0, a[i]]`, `p` is `-10**
