The function `func` accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function processes three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, k ≤ n`, and an array `a` consisting of `n` integers with each element satisfying `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 ⋅ 10^5`.

The function does not have a direct return statement provided in the given context, so it likely returns some processed result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not detailed here.
