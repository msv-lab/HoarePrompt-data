The code `p = m` assigns the value of `m` to `p`. Since `m` is initially greater than `p`, the value of `p` will now be the same as `m`. The initial values of `m` and `p` are integers, and `m` was originally greater than `p`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `p` is equal to `m`**
