The code `n, k, x = R()` assigns values from the function `R()` to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the function `R()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `x`. However, the initial state of `t` is a non-zero integer -1, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer -1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`**
