The code reads a string of space-separated integers, converts them to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`, and assigns this list to `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are not affected by this operation, but the input string is now processed and stored in `a`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is a list of integers created by converting the input string to integers, `q[j]` is the sum of the first `j` elements of `a`, `p` is the maximum value of `m` encountered during the loop execution, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]` where `l` is `0` if `i - x < 1` or `i - x` otherwise, and `q` is updated to reflect the cumulative sums of `a` throughout the loop iterations, and `p` is printed, `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from the input split by spaces.**
