According to the given for loop, the loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. The loop condition is that `i` should be less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer (unchanged)
- `i` is `n - k - 1` (increased by 1)
- `n` is a positive integer (unchanged)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (unchanged)
- `n` is greater than `i` (the new value of `i` needs to be checked against `n`)
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (unchanged)
- `q` is `[0, a[i]]` (needs to be updated with the new value of `a[i]`)
- `p` is `-10` (unchanged)

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. Since `i` was `n - k - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n - k - 1 + 1 = n - k`.
2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `n > i` was true previously and `i` is now `n - k`, the condition `n > i` remains true.
3. `t` remains unchanged.
4. `a` remains unchanged.
5. `p` remains `-10`.
6. `q` is updated to `[0, a[n - k]]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is `[0, a[n - k]]`, `p` is `-10**
