`i` is initially `n - 1`. The code assigns `i - x` to `l`. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, it remains unchanged. Therefore, `l` is updated to `n - 1 - x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` and `p` are integers where `m` > `p`, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n - 1 - x`**
