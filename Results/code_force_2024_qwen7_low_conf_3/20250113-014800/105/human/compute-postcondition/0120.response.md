Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. For each test case, it sorts the list \( a \) in ascending order and computes a maximum value \( p \). This value \( p \) is defined as \( 2 \times \text{sum}(a[l:i]) - \text{sum}(a[0:i]) \) for some range \( [l, i] \) where \( l = 0 \) if \( i - x < 1 \), otherwise \( l = i - x \). The function then prints \( p \) for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed all test cases, printed the computed maximum values \( p \) for each test case, and reset the global variables \( t \), \( i \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \) to their initial states.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( x \geq n - k + 1 \), the condition \( i - x < 1 \) will always evaluate to true, making \( l = 0 \). This needs to be considered to ensure correct computation of \( p \).
- If \( k = n \), the expression \( i - x \) might result in a negative index, which should be handled appropriately (e.g., by setting \( l = 0 \)).
- The function assumes that the input values are valid (positive integers and within specified ranges), and it does not handle invalid inputs explicitly.
