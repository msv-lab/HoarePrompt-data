In the given code snippet, `a += a[-1] + y,` means that the last element of the list `a` (denoted as `a[-1]`) is added to `y`, and the result is appended to the list `a`. Since `R()` returns a non-empty list, let's assume `a` initially contains some elements, and `y` is a variable.

Let's denote the initial state of `a` as `[a1, a2, ..., an]` and the value of `y` as `y_val`.

The code updates `a` as follows:
- The last element of `a` is `an`.
- The new element to be appended is `an + y_val`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the updated list `a` will be `[a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val]`.

Output State: **`a` is now `[a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val]`**
