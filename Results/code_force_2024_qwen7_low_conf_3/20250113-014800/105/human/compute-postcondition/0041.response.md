The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This impacts the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` by assigning them the values from the input split by spaces. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `q`, `p`, and `m`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is a list of integers created by converting the input string to integers and sorted in ascending order, `q[j]` is the sum of the first `j` elements of `a`, `p` is the maximum value of `m` encountered during the loop execution, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]` where `l` is `0` if `i - x < 1` or `i - x` otherwise, and `q` is updated to reflect the cumulative sums of `a` throughout the loop iterations, and `p` is printed, `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from the input split by spaces.**
