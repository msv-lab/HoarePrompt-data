`p` is assigned the value of `m`. The value of `m` is either `2 * q[0] - q[n - k + 1]` or `2 * q[((n - k + 1) - x)] - q[n - k + 1]`, depending on the value of `x`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, and `q`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n - k + 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `((n - k + 1) - x)`, depending on whether `i - x < 1`, `m` is either `2 * q[0] - q[n - k + 1]` or `2 * q[((n - k + 1) - x)] - q[n - k + 1]`, and `p` is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `((n - k + 1) - x)`, depending on whether `i - x < 1`, `m` is either `2 * q[0] - q[n - k + 1]` or `2 * q[((n - k + 1) - x)] - q[n - k + 1]`, and `p` is equal to `m`.**
