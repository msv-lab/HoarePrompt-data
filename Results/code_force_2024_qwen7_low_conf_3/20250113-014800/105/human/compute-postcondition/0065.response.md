`l` is assigned the value `i - x`. Given that `i` is `n - k`, the value of `l` becomes `(n - k) - x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n - k`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `l` is `(n - k) - x`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `l` is `(n - k) - x`**
