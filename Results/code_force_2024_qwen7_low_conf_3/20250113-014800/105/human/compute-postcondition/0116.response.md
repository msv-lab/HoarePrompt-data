Output State: **`m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution, `p` is equal to `m`, `i` is `n`, and `l` is either 0 or `n - x`.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization and Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `n - k` to `n`.
   - For each iteration, `l` is set based on the condition `i - x < 1`.
     - If `i - x < 1`, then `l = 0`.
     - Otherwise, `l = i - x`.

2. **Updating `m` and `p`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `2 * q[l] - q[i]`.
   - `p` is updated to `m` if `m > p`.

3. **Final Values After All Iterations:**
   - After all iterations, `i` will reach `n` because the loop iterates from `n - k` to `n`.
   - The maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop is stored in `p`.
   - The value of `m` will be `p` because `p` is updated to `m` whenever `m > p`.

4. **Determining `l`:**
   - Depending on the value of `x`, `l` will either be `0` (if `i - x < 1`) or `n - x` (if `i - x >= 1`).
   - Since the loop ends when `i` reaches `n`, `l` will be `0` if `n - x < 1` or `n - x` otherwise.

5. **Non-execution Case:**
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n - k < 1`), then `i` will not start from any valid index, and `p` will remain `-10` (the initial value).

Thus, the final output state is that `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution, `p` is equal to `m`, `i` is `n`, and `l` is either `0` or `n - x`.
