The line of code `l = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `l`. The value of `l` was previously either `0` or `n - x`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is \( n - k \), \( n \) is a positive integer and greater than or equal to \( k \), \( l \) is 0, \( m \) is the maximum value of \( 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \) encountered during the loop execution, \( p \) is \(-10\), and the list \( q \) contains \( n + 1 \) elements where each element starting from the original elements up to the last element is computed as \( q[-1] + a[i] \) for \( i \) ranging from \( 0 \) to \( n-1\). The current value of \( i \) is less than \( x + 1 \)**
