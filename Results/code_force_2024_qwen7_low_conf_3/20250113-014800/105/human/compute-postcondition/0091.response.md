Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `n - x`, `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution, `p` is `-10`, and the list `q` contains `n + 1` elements where each element starting from the original elements up to the last element is computed as `q[-1] + a[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `n` iterations, so `i` will be incremented from `0` to `n-1`, and after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
- The list `q` starts with `n + 1` elements. Initially, `q` had some unknown values, and during each iteration, the last element of `q` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it. This means after the loop, `q` will have `n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are the result of the cumulative additions performed by the loop, and the last element is the final value after the last addition.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
