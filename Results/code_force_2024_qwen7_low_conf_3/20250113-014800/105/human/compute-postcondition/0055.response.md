`l` is assigned the value `0`, which means the variable `l` is now `0`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. The condition `i - x < 1` also remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is 0, and `i - x < 1`**
