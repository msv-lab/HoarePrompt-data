Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (not needed for loop execution).
   - `i` is `n - k - 1` (this value of `i` should be correct for the first iteration of the loop).
   - `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (these conditions are already met).
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (not needed for loop execution).
   - `q` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements from the list `a` up to that point (not needed for loop execution).
   - `p` is `-10` (not needed for loop execution).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n - k, n + 1)`. This means the loop will run from `i = n - k - 1` to `i = n`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must satisfy the condition `n - k <= i < n + 1`.
   - Given `i` is initially set to `n - k - 1`, the loop will start executing as long as `n - k - 1 >= n - k`, which is always true.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - The initial value of `i` (`n - k - 1`) ensures that the loop starts correctly.
   - We need to confirm that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`. Since `i` is incremented within the loop, we need to ensure that the loop condition is satisfied until `i` reaches `n`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs adjustment is to ensure that `i` starts at `n - k - 1` and the loop runs until `i` reaches `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`**
