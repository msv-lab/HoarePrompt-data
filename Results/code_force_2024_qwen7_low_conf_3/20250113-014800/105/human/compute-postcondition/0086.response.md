The code snippet `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])` appends the value of `q[-1] + a[i]` to the list `q`. Here are the steps to determine the updated state:

1. `i` is a value within the range `[0, n-1]`.
2. `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to `k`.
3. `l` is either `0` or `n - x`.
4. `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution.
5. `p` is `-10`.

After the code `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])` is executed, the last element of the list `q` is updated to `q[-1] + a[i]`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is a value within the range `[0, n-1]`, `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `n - x`, `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution, `p` is `-10`, and the list `q` now includes its original elements plus one additional element which is `q[-1] + a[i]`.**
