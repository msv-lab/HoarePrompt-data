Postcondition: **`i` is \( n - k \), \( n \) is a positive integer and greater than or equal to \( k \), \( l \) is either \( 0 \) or \( n - x \), \( m \) is the maximum value of \( 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \) encountered during the loop execution, \( p \) is \(-10\), and the list \( q \) contains \( n + 1 \) elements where each element starting from the original elements up to the last element is computed as \( q[-1] + a[i] \) for \( i \) ranging from \( 0 \) to \( n-1\). The current value of \( i \) is less than \( x + 1 \)**
