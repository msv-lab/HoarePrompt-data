`l` is reassigned the value of `i - x`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - k + 1`, and `l` is either `0` or `(n - k) - x`. Since `l` is initially defined in terms of `n`, `k`, and `x`, the new value of `l` will be `i - x`, which simplifies to `(n - k + 1) - x`. 

Therefore, the updated state for `l` is `(n - k + 1) - x`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is `(n - k + 1) - x`, `m` is either `2 * q[0] - q[n - k]` or `2 * q[(n - k) - x] - q[n - k]`, and `p` remains unchanged.**
