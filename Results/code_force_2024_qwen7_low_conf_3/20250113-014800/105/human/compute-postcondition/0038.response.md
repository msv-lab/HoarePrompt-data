Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of all elements in `R()` up to that point, `n` is the last value returned by `R()`, `k` is the last value returned by `R()`, `x` is the last value returned by `R()`, the print statement outputs the maximum value of the expression `max(2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i] for i in range(n - k, n + 1))` based on the final values of `a`, `x`, `n`, and `k`.**
