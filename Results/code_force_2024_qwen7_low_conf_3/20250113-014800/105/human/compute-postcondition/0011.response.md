The code snippet updates the list `a` by appending the sum of its last element and `y`. However, the value of `y` is not defined in the given initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `a`. We only know that the last element of `a` (which is `next_y`) will be added to `y` and the result will be appended to `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is -1
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`
- `x` is a value returned by `R()`
- `a` is `[0, next_y]`

After executing the code:
- The last element of `a` (which is `next_y`) is added to `y`, and the result is appended to `a`.

Therefore, the updated `a` will be `[0, next_y, next_y + y]`.

Output State: **`t` is -1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, next_y, next_y + y]`**
