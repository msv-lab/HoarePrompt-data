The code `print(p)` simply prints the value of `p`. According to the initial state, `p` is equal to `m`, which is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution. The values of `i`, `l`, and `n` are also given, but they are not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the only change is that the value of `p` (which is `m`) is printed. Since `p` is equal to `m` and no new value is assigned to `p`, the value of `p` remains unchanged after the print statement.

Output State: **`m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution, `p` is equal to `m`, `i` is `n`, and `l` is either 0 or `n - x`; `p` is printed.**
