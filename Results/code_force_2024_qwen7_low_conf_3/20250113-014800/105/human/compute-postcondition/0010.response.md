Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `t` is -1
   - `n` is a value returned by `R()`
   - `k` is a value returned by `R()`
   - `x` is a value returned by `R()`
   - `a` is `[0, y]`, where `y` is defined and is part of the sorted list generated by `sorted(R())`

2. **Loop Analysis**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for y in sorted(R()):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This means `y` takes values from the sorted list generated by `sorted(R())`.

3. **Key Variables**:
   - `y` changes with each iteration of the loop.
   - Since `y` is defined and part of the sorted list, the loop continues until all values of `y` from `sorted(R())` are exhausted.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to take the next value from `sorted(R())`.
   - Therefore, `a` will be updated to `[0, next_y]`, where `next_y` is the next value in the sorted list after `y`.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `t` remains `-1` (no change).
   - `n` remains the value returned by `R()` (no change).
   - `k` remains the value returned by `R()` (no change).
   - `x` remains the value returned by `R()` (no change).
   - `a` is updated to `[0, next_y]`, where `next_y` is the next value in the sorted list after `y`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is -1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, next_y]`**, where `next_y` is the next value in the sorted list after `y`.
