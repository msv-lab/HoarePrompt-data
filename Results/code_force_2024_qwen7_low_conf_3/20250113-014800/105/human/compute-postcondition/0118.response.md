Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is a list of integers created by converting the input string to integers and sorted in ascending order, `q[j]` is the sum of the first `j` elements of `a`, `p` is the maximum value of `m` encountered during the loop execution, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]` where `l` is `0` if `i - x < 1` or `i - x` otherwise, `q` is updated to reflect the cumulative sums of `a` throughout the loop iterations, and `p` is printed after the loop finishes executing.**
