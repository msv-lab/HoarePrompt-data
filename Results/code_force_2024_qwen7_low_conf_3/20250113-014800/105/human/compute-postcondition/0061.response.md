The code sets `p` to the value of `m`. Since the if condition `m > p` was true, it means that the value of `m` before this assignment was greater than `p`. After this assignment, `p` now holds the value of `m`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, if `i - x < 1`, then `l` is 0 and `m` is `2 * q[0] - q[n - k - 1]`, otherwise `l` is `(n - k - 1) - x` and `m` is `2 * q[(n - k - 1) - x] - q[n - k - 1]`; `p` is equal to `m`**
