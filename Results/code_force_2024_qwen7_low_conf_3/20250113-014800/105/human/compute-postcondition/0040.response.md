Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes three positive integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then constructs a new list \( a \) containing cumulative sums and computes the maximum value of the expression \( \max(2 \cdot a[\max(i, x) - x] - a[i]) \) for \( i \) ranging from \( n-k \) to \( n \). The function prints this maximum value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function sets `t` to 0, and the final state of the program includes the computed results for each test case. Potential edge cases include scenarios where \( n \) is small (e.g., 1), \( k \) and \( x \) are within the bounds of \( n \), and the input values are within the specified constraints. The function does not handle invalid input directly; instead, it relies on the correctness of the input provided by the user.**
