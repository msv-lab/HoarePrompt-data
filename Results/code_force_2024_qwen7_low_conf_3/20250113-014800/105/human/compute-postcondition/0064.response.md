`l` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `i` is `n - k`, and the conditions that `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n - k`, `l` is `0`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k`, `l` is `0`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`**
