`p` is assigned the value of `m`. The value of `m` is \(2 \times q[l] - q[n - k]\). The states of the other variables (`i`, `l`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is updated to \(2 \times q[l] - q[n - k]\); `p` is equal to `m`; `i` is `n - k`; `l` is either 0 or \((n - k) - x\).

Output State: **`m` is updated to \(2 \times q[l] - q[n - k]\); `p` is equal to `m`; `i` is `n - k`; `l` is either 0 or \((n - k) - x\)**
