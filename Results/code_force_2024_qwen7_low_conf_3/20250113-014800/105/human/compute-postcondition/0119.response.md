The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function processes three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\). Additionally, the function receives a list `a` of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\) for all \(i\). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The function does not return a single value but rather processes multiple inputs (test cases) and performs some operation based on these inputs. Since the specific operation is not detailed in the provided information, the focus is on describing the input parameters.
