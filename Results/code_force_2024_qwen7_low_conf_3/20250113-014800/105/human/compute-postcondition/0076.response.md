Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - k + 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `((n - k + 1) - x)`, depending on whether `i - x < 1`, `m` is either `2 * q[0] - q[n - k + 1]` or `2 * q[((n - k + 1) - x)] - q[n - k + 1]`, and `p` is equal to `m` if `m > p`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `l`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged.***
