The code snippet defines a lambda function `R` which reads multiple integers from input and returns them as a tuple. However, this function does not assign any values directly to variables, it only processes input. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ `x`, `k` ≤ `n`. The array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000 for all elements `a_i` in the array. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lambda function `R` is defined to read input and return it as a tuple of integers.**
