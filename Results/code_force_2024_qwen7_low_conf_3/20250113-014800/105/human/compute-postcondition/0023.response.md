`a` is updated by adding `a[-1] + y` to the list. Here, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, which is `2 * y_next`. Since `y` is not defined, it should be treated as an undefined variable. However, for the sake of calculation, let's assume `y` is a value returned by `R()`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 0
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`
- `x` is a value returned by `R()`
- `a` is `[0, y_next, 2 * y_next]`

After executing `a += a[-1] + y`, the new value of `a` will be `[0, y_next, 2 * y_next, 2 * y_next + y]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 0; `n` is a value returned by `R()`; `k` is a value returned by `R()`; `x` is a value returned by `R()`; `a` is `[0, y_next, 2 * y_next, 2 * y_next + y]`**
