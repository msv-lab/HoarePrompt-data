Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- \( i \) is \( n \)
- \( n \) is a positive integer and greater than or equal to \( k \)
- \( l \) is either \( 0 \) or \( n - x \)
- \( m \) is the maximum value of \( 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \) encountered during the loop execution
- \( p \) is \(-10\)
- The list \( q \) contains \( n + 1 \) elements where each element starting from the original elements up to the last element is computed as \( q[-1] + a[i] \) for \( i \) ranging from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
\[ \text{for } i \text{ in range}(n - k, n + 1): \]

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Value of \( i \)**:
   - The loop starts with \( i = n \). However, the loop iterates from \( n - k \) to \( n \).
   - Therefore, \( i \) needs to be adjusted to the starting value of the range, which is \( n - k \).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start executing, \( n - k \) must be less than or equal to \( n \), which is always true since \( k \geq 0 \).
   - However, the initial value of \( i \) should be \( n - k \) to meet the loop condition.

3. **Values of \( q \)**:
   - The list \( q \) is defined such that its elements are computed based on the values of \( a[i] \) for \( i \) ranging from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
   - Since the loop starts at \( i = n - k \), the relevant elements of \( q \) will be \( q[n-k], q[n-k+1], \ldots, q[n] \).

4. **Variable \( l \)**:
   - \( l \) can be either \( 0 \) or \( n - x \). These values do not directly affect the loop execution but are used within the loop to compute \( m \).

5. **Variable \( m \)**:
   - \( m \) is initialized to \(-10\) and updated during the loop based on the expression \( 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \).
   - The loop will update \( m \) based on the values of \( q \) and \( l \).

6. **Variable \( p \)**:
   - \( p \) is not directly involved in the loop condition but might be updated inside the loop.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute correctly, we need to adjust the state such that \( i \) starts from \( n - k \).

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is \( n - k \), \( n \) is a positive integer and greater than or equal to \( k \), \( l \) is either \( 0 \) or \( n - x \), \( m \) is the maximum value of \( 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \) encountered during the loop execution, \( p \) is \(-10\), and the list \( q \) contains \( n + 1 \) elements where each element starting from the original elements up to the last element is computed as \( q[-1] + a[i] \) for \( i \) ranging from \( 0 \) to \( n-1`**.
