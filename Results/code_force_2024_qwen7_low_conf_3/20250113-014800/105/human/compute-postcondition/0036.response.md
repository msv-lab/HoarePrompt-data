Output State: **`a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of all elements in `R()` up to that point, and `y` is the last element of the sorted `R()` list.**

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list `R()`.
   - In each iteration, it appends the sum of the previous last element of `a` and the current element `y` to the list `a`.

2. **Analyzing the Output States:**
   - After the loop executes 1 time, `a` becomes `[a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val]`.
   - After the loop executes 2 times, `a` becomes `[a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val, an + y_val + y]`.
   - After the loop executes 3 times, `a` becomes `[a1, a2, ..., an, an + y_val, an + y_val + y_next, an + y_val + y_next + y]`.

From these observations, we can deduce that each element in `a` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `R()` up to that point. The last element of `a` will be the sum of all elements in `R()`.

3. **General Case:**
   - If the loop executes `m` times (where `m` is the number of elements in `R()`), `a` will contain all cumulative sums of `R()` up to the last element.
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `R()` is empty), then `a` remains `[0]`.

Thus, the final output state is that `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of all elements in `R()` up to that point, and `y` is the last element of the sorted `R()` list.
