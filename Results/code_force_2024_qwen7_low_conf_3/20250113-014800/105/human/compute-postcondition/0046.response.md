Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The given initial state is:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n - k - 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `q` is `[0]`.
   - `p` is `-10`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`, inclusive. This means the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Variables Involved in Loop Execution**: The key variables involved in determining if the loop can execute are `i` and `n`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i = n - k - 1`, we need to ensure that `n - k - 1 < n`, which simplifies to `k > 0`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 0, this condition is already met.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The value of `i` should be such that `i < n` for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `n - k - 1` and `n` should be greater than `i`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute. 

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is `[0]`, `p` is `-10**
