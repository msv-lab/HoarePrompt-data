Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i - x < 1`, then `l` is 0 and `m` is `2 * q[0] - q[n - k - 1]`, otherwise `l` is `(n - k - 1) - x` and `m` is `2 * q[(n - k - 1) - x] - q[n - k - 1]`. Given the if condition `m > p`, the current value of `m` is greater than `p`.***
