Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `n - x`, depending on whether `i - x < 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop execution, and `p` is equal to `m` if `m > p` during each iteration.**

Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = n - k - 1`.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `n - k` to `n`.
   - For each value of `i`, `l` is determined based on the condition `i - x < 1`.
   - `m` is calculated as `2 * q[l] - q[i]`.
   - If `m > p`, then `p` is updated to `m`.
3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
   - `l` will be the last value of `l` computed, which could be `0` or `n - x` (if `n - x < 1`).
   - `m` will be the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` encountered during the loop.
   - `p` will hold the maximum value of `m` found during the loop.

Thus, the final output state reflects the last computed values of `i`, `l`, `m`, and `p` after the loop has finished executing.
