The code `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])` appends a new element to the list `q`. The new element is the sum of the last element in the list `q` and the element `a[i]`.

- `i` is already set to `i + 2`.
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to `k`.
- `l` is either `0` or `n - x`.
- `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i + 1]` encountered during the loop execution.
- `p` is `-10`.
- The list `q` now includes its original elements plus the new element `q[-1] + a[i]`.

After executing the code, the new element `q[-1]` will be updated to `q[-1] + a[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to `k`, `l` is either `0` or `n - x`, `m` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i + 1]` encountered during the loop execution, `p` is `-10`, and the list `q` now includes its original elements plus the new element `q[-1] + a[i]`.**
