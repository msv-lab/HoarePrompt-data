Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is `n - k - 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - The loop iterates over `range(n - k, n + 1)`.

2. **Loop Range Analysis:**
   - The loop starts from `n - k` and goes up to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - k - 1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - The next value of `i` would be `n - k - 1 + 1 = n - k`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be updated to `n - k`.
   - Since the loop is iterating from `n - k` to `n`, the condition for the next iteration is simply checking if `i < n + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is `n - k`.
- `n` is still a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The state should be modified as follows:
State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`**
