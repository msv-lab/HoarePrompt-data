The code `a += a[-1] + y` means that the last element of the list `a` is updated to be its current value plus the value of `a[-1]` (which is 0) plus the value of `y`. Since `a` initially contains only one element, which is 0, the operation simplifies to updating `a` to contain `[0, 0 + 0 + y]` or `[0, y]`.

- `t` is a non-zero integer (-1) and remains unchanged.
- `n` is a value returned by `R()` and remains unchanged.
- `k` is a value returned by `R()` and remains unchanged.
- `x` is a value returned by `R()` and remains unchanged.
- `a` is updated from `[0]` to `[0, y]`.
- `y` is defined and remains unchanged as part of the sorted list generated by `sorted(R())`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is -1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is [0, y], `y` is defined and is part of the sorted list generated by `sorted(R())`**.
