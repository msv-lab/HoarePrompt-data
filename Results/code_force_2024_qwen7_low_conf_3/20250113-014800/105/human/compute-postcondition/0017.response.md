The initial state is as follows:
- `t` is 0
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`
- `x` is a value returned by `R()`
- `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the sorted list generated by `sorted(R())`
- The printed value is the maximum of `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for `i` in the range `n - k` to `n`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
a = [0]
```

This line initializes the list `a` with a single element `0`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is to the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0]`, the printed value is the maximum of `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for `i` in the range `n - k` to `n`**
