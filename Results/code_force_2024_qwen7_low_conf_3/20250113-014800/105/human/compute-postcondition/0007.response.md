`a` is a list that initially contains one element `0`. The code `a += a[-1] + y` tries to append `a[-1] + y` to the list `a`. However, the variable `y` is not defined in the provided initial state, and no value for `y` is provided. Given this, we cannot determine the exact new value to append to `a`.

Since `y` is not defined, the code will raise a NameError if executed. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged due to the error.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer -1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing one element 0, and there is a NameError due to the undefined variable `y`.**
