`l` is assigned the value of `i - x`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n - k - 1`, and `i - x >= 1`, the value of `l` will be `(n - k - 1) - x`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `l` is `(n - k - 1) - x`**
