`p` is assigned the value of `m`. The value of `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`. The value of `p` was previously greater than `m`, but now it is equal to `m`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`; `p` is equal to `m`; `i` is `n - 1`; if `i - x < 1`, then `l` is 0; otherwise, `l` is `n - 1 - x`.**
