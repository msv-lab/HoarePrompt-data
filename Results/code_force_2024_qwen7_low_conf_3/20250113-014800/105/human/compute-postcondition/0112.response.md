Postcondition: ***`m` is updated to \(2 \times q[l] - q[n - k]\); `p` is an integer where `m > p`; `i` is `n - k`; `l` is either 0 or `(n - k) - x`***

This postcondition covers both cases of the if and else parts, ensuring that the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block is accurately described.
