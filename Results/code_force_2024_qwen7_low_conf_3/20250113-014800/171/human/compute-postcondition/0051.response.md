Output State: **`l` is `n - 1`, `res` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `r` until the end of the list, plus `a[r][0]` minus the sum of differences between consecutive elements up to index `l`, and `res` is less than or equal to `t`**.

Explanation:
1. Initially, `l` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
2. After the loop completes, `l` will be `n - 1` because it starts at `n` and increments `l` in each iteration, stopping when `res` is no longer greater than `t`.
3. The value of `res` is updated in each iteration by subtracting `a[l][0]` and optionally subtracting `a[l+1][1] - a[l][1]` if `l < n - 1`.
4. The final value of `res` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `r` until the end of the list, plus `a[r][0]` minus the sum of differences up to index `l`, ensuring that `res` is less than or equal to `t` after the loop terminates.
