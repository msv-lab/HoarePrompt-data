To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while r < n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order
- `l` is equal to `n`
- `r` is at least 2
- `res` is equal to the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `l` until the end of the list, or the initial value of `res` if `l` reaches the end of the list

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `r < n` must be true. Given that `r` is at least 2 and initially `l` is equal to `n`, the only way for the loop to continue is if `r` is incremented and remains less than `n`.

However, the state information provided indicates that `l` is equal to `n` and `r` is at least 2. This means that the loop cannot continue because `r` is not less than `n`. The only way to satisfy the condition `r < n` would be to change `r` to be less than `n`.

Since `l` is fixed at `n` and cannot change (as the problem does not suggest any operation that changes `l`), we need to adjust `r` to be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is equal to `n`, `r` must be less than `n`, and `res` is equal to the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `l` until the end of the list, or the initial value of `res` if `l` reaches the end of the list.**
