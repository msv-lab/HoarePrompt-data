`res` is assigned the value of `res + a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1]`. Since `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, the values of `a[r][1]` and `a[r - 1][1]` are specific integers. However, their exact values are not given, so we can only say that `res` is updated by adding `a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `q` is an integer (initially non-zero but reduced to zero by the loop), `l` is 0, `r` is at least 1, `res` is equal to `res + a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1]`**
