`res` is decreased by `a[l][0]`. The value of `l` is either `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`, and `r` is `n`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` must be greater than `t + (a[n][1] - a[n-1][1])`. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` is decreased by `a[l][0]` and must be greater than `t + (a[n][1] - a[n-1][1])`.

Output State: **`l` is `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` is decreased by `a[l][0]` and must be greater than `t + (a[n][1] - a[n-1][1])`**
