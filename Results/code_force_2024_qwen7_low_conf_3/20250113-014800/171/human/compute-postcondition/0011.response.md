Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `q` is an integer (initially non-zero but reduced to zero by the loop), `l` is 0, `r` is at least 1, and `res` is equal to `res + a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1]` if `r > 0`. Otherwise, the postconditions remain as the initial conditions specified in the precondition.***
