The code `res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]` updates the value of `res` by subtracting the difference between the second elements of the sublists at indices `l + 1` and `l` from `res`. 

From the initial state:
- `res` is initially equal to `res - a[l][0]`.
- `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order.
- `l` is less than `n - 1`.
- `r` is at least 1.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.

After executing the code, the value of `res` changes to `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.

The updated value of `res` simplifies to:
\[ res = res - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1] \]

Since `res` was initially `res - a[l][0]`, we substitute this into the equation:
\[ res = (res - a[l][0]) - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1] \]
\[ res = res - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1] \]

All other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`res` is `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is at least 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0.**
