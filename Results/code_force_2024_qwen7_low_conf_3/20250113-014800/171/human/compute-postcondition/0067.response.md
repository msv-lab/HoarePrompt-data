Postcondition: ***`l` is `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` is adjusted according to the following: if `l < n - 1`, `res` is decreased by `(a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`; otherwise, `res` remains `res - (a[l][1] - a[n-1][1])` and must be greater than `t + (a[n][1] - a[n-1][1])`***
