Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is at least 1, `res` is updated to `res - (a[l][1] - a[l-1][1])` if `l < n - 1`.***
