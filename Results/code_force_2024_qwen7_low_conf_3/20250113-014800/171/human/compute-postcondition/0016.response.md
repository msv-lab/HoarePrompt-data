Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is at least 1, `res` is `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.***
