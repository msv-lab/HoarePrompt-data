The code reads two integers, `n` and `t`, from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`, respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\). After the code executes, `t` remains within this range, and `n` is assigned the value of the second integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is the second integer input from the first line of input.**
