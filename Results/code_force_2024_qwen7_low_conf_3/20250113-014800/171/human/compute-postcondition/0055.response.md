`res` is incremented by `a[r][0]`. Given the initial state where `r` is `n`, the value of `a[r][0]` is effectively `a[n][0]`. The values of `l`, `r`, `res`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n`, `res` is `res + a[n][0]`, `ans` remains unchanged**
