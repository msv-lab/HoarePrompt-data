`res` is updated by subtracting the difference between the second elements of `a[l+1]` and `a[l]`. The initial value of `res` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `r` until the end of the list, plus `a[r][0]` minus `a[l-1][0]` (or `a[n-1][0]`), and it is greater than `t`. After the subtraction, the new value of `res` will be the previous value of `res` minus `a[l+1][1] - a[l][1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is equal to `n`, `r` is less than `n - 1`, `res` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `r` until the end of the list, plus `a[r][0]` minus `a[l-1][0]` (or `a[n-1][0]`), minus `a[l+1][1] - a[l][1]`, and remains greater than `t`.**
