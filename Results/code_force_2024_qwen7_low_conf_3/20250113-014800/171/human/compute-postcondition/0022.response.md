`l` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` was previously incremented by 1 from the initial state, but the exact value is not specified. Since the code simply increments `l` by 1, the new value of `l` will be its previous value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is at least 1, `res` is updated to `res - (a[l][1] - a[l-1][1])` if `l < n - 1`.**
