`res` is updated by subtracting the difference between `a[l + 1][1]` and `a[l][1]` from its current value. Since `l` is equal to `n - 1`, `l + 1` is `n`. Therefore, the difference `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]` is `a[n][1] - a[n - 1][1]`.

Given the initial state, `res` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `r` until the end of the list, plus `a[r][0]` minus `a[n-1][0]`. After executing the line `res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`, the new value of `res` will be the original `res` minus `a[n][1] - a[n - 1][1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is less than `n - 1`, `res` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `r` until the end of the list, plus `a[r][0]` minus `a[n-1][0]` minus `a[n][1] - a[n - 1][1]`, and `res` must be greater than `t`.**
