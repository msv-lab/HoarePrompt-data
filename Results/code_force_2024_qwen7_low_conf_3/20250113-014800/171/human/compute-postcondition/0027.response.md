The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `l` was incremented by 1 from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is at least 1, and `res` is `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` if `l < n - 1`; otherwise, the same conditions as the precondition hold.**
