`l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` was either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`, incrementing it by 1 means `l` is now `n` (if it was `n - 1`) or `l` is now 1 more than its original value (if it was less than `n - 1`). The value of `r` remains `n`, `res` is updated as `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` if `l` is less than `n - 1` (now it would be `l < n` because `l` is incremented to `n`), and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`; `r` is `n`; `res` is updated as `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` if `l` was less than `n - 1`; `ans` remains unchanged.**
