`res` is incremented by `a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1]`. Given the initial state, `r` is `n` and `r - 1` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `res` becomes `res + a[n][0] + a[n][1] - a[n - 1][1]`. The states of the other variables (`l` and `ans`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n`, `res` is `res + a[n][0] + a[n][1] - a[n - 1][1]`, `ans` remains unchanged**
