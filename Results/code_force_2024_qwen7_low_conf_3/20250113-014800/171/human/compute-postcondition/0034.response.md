Postcondition: ***`ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is equal to `n`, `r` is less than `n`, and `res` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `r` until the end of the list, plus `a[r][0]`. If `r > 0`, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1]`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
