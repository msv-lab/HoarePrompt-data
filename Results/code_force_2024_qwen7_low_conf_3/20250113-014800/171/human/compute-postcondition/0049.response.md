Postcondition: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is equal to `n + 1`, `r` is less than `n - 1`, and `res` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `r` until the end of the list, plus `a[r][0]` minus `a[l-1][0]` (or `a[n-1][0]`), minus `a[l+1][1] - a[l][1]`, minus `a[l][0]`, with `res` being updated as `original res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` if `l < n - 1`.**
