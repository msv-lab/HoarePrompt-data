`ans` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `r - l + 1`. The values of `l` and `r` are defined as `n + k` and `n`, respectively, where `k` is the number of iterations. Since `l` is `n + k` and `r` is `n`, `r - l + 1` simplifies to `n - (n + k) + 1`, which further simplifies to `-k + 1`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `-k + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is `n + k`, `r` is `n`, `res` is the final value after all subtractions, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `-k + 1`.**
