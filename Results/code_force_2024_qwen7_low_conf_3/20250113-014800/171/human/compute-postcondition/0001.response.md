The code initializes a list `a` by reading `n` lines of input, each containing space-separated integers, and converting them into a list of lists. Each sublist corresponds to one line of input. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged in their types, but their values might change.

Let's assume `t` is `50000` and `n` is `3` for this example (since these are typical values within the given range).

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `t` remains an integer between `1` and `50000`.
2. `n` remains the second integer input, which is `3` in our example.
3. A list comprehension is used to read `n` lines of input and convert each line into a list of integers.

For the sake of this example, let's assume the input lines are:
- Line 1: `1 2 3`
- Line 2: `4 5 6`
- Line 3: `7 8 9`

This means `a` will be transformed into:
```
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

Thus, after the code is executed, the variables `t` and `n` retain their initial types and values, while `a` is updated to contain the parsed data.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of n lists of integers.**
