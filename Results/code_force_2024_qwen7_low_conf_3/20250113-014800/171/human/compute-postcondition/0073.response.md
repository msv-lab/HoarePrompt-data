The value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the initial conditions are that `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` is either `res` or `res > t` holds true, given the condition `l < n - 1` is met. After incrementing `l` by 1, the new value of `l` becomes `n + 2`. Since `l` is now `n + 2`, which is greater than `n - 1`, the condition `l < n - 1` is no longer met.

Output State: **`l` is `n + 2`, `r` is `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` is either `res` or `res > t` holds true.**
