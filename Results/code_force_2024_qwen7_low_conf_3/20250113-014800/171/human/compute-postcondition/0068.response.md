The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` is `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`. Therefore, after incrementing, `l` will be `n + 1` if it was originally `n`, or it will be `l + 1` if it was 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`.

Since `l` is now increased by 1, it means that `l` is no longer less than `n - 1`. Thus, the condition for updating `res` changes. Now, `res` is decreased by `(a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, which simplifies to `(a[n + 1][1] - a[n][1])` since `l` is now `n + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` is decreased by `(a[n + 1][1] - a[n][1])`**
