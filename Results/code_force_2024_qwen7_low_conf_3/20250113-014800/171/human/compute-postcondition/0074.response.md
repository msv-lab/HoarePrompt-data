To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information.

### Initial State:
- `l` is `n - 1`
- `r` is `n`
- `res` is updated to `res + a[n][0] + a[n][1] - a[n - 1][1]` if `r > 0`
- `ans` remains unchanged

### Loop Execution Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - Condition: `res > t`
   - `res -= a[l][0]`
   - If `l < n - 1`, then `res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`
   - `l += 1`
   
   After first iteration:
   - `l` is `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`
   - `r` remains `n`
   - `res` is updated accordingly
   - `ans` remains unchanged

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - Condition: `res > t`
   - `res -= a[l][0]`
   - If `l < n - 1`, then `res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`
   - `l += 1`
   
   After second iteration:
   - `l` is `n + 1`
   - `r` remains `n`
   - `res` is further decreased
   - `ans` remains unchanged

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - Condition: `res > t`
   - `res -= a[l][0]`
   - If `l < n - 1`, then `res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`
   - `l += 1`
   
   After third iteration:
   - `l` is `n + 2`
   - `r` remains `n`
   - `res` is further decreased
   - `ans` remains unchanged

From these iterations, we can infer that each time the loop runs, `l` increases by 1, and `res` decreases by `a[l][0]` and possibly `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`.

### General Case:
- The loop continues until `res <= t` or `l` reaches or exceeds `n`.
- `l` will eventually become `n + k` where `k` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `r` remains `n`.
- `res` will be the final value after all subtractions.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

### Final Output State:
The loop will terminate when `res <= t` or `l` reaches `n`. At this point, `l` will be `n + k` where `k` is the number of iterations, `r` will still be `n`, and `res` will be the final value.

Output State: **`l` is `n + k` where `k` is the number of iterations, `r` is `n`, `res` is the final value after all subtractions, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
