The given code snippet includes a loop that reads an integer `q` from input and then enters a while loop that continues until `q` reaches 0. Inside the loop, two integers `l` and `r` are read from input using `map(int, input().split())`, and `q` is decremented by 1. However, the actual values of `l` and `r` are not used in the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is the second integer input.
- `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers.

The code snippet itself does not modify `t`, `n`, or `a`. It only reads values for `q`, `l`, and `r`, but does not perform any operations with them. Thus, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `q` is an integer (initially non-zero but reduced to zero by the loop)**.
