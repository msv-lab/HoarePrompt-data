`res` is updated by subtracting `a[l][0]` from its current value. The initial value of `l` is `n - 1` and `r` is `n`. The condition `r > 0` was checked before this line of code, and if true, `res` was updated to `res + a[n][0] + a[n][1] - a[n - 1][1]`. However, the current line only affects `res` by subtracting `a[l][0]`.

Output State: **`l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n`, `res` is the original value of `res` minus `a[l][0]`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
