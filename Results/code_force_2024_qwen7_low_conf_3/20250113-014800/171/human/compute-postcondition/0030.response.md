`r` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `r` is at least 1, so now `r` will be at least 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is equal to `n`, `r` is at least 2, and `res` is equal to the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from index `l` until the end of the list, or the initial value of `res` if `l` reaches the end of the list.**
