The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to process a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it takes `n` and `l` as integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`. It then processes `n` pairs of integers `a_i` and `b_i` where `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9`. The function calculates `r - l + 1` for each pair and keeps track of the maximum value encountered. Finally, it returns the maximum value of `r - l + 1` found across all test cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a series of test cases, each containing `n` and `l`, and for each pair `a_i` and `b_i`, calculate `r - l + 1`. The function returns the maximum value of `r - l + 1` encountered during the loop.
