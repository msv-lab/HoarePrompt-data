To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition that controls the loop: `while res > t`.

Let's break down the given information and analyze it step by step:

1. **Initial State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `l` is `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`.
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `res` is updated as `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` if `l` was less than `n - 1`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `res > t`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `res` must still be greater than `t` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that after the update in the loop body, `res` is still greater than `t`.

Given that `res` is updated only when `l` is less than `n - 1`, we need to consider this condition and the resulting change in `res`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Condition for Loop Continuation:**
  - The loop will continue if `res > t` after the update.

- **Update in the Loop Body:**
  - If `l` was less than `n - 1`, then `res` is updated by subtracting `(a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` from `res`.
  - This means `res` decreases by the difference between the second element of `a[l + 1]` and the second element of `a[l]`.

- **Ensuring `res > t`:**
  - For the loop to continue, the updated value of `res` must still be greater than `t`.
  - This implies that the value subtracted from `res` should not make `res <= t`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`res` Value:**
  - We need to ensure that `res` is still greater than `t` after the subtraction.
  - Therefore, the initial value of `res` before the update must be such that even after subtracting the maximum possible value, `res` is still greater than `t`.

### Conclusion:

The critical adjustment needed is to ensure that the initial value of `res` is sufficiently large to maintain the condition `res > t` even after the update.

State: **`l` is `n` or 1 more than its original value which was less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` must be greater than `t + (a[n][1] - a[n-1][1])` (the maximum possible value subtracted from `res`).**
