The code `res -= a[l][0]` subtracts the first element of the sublist at index `l` from the variable `res`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a`, `l`, and `res`, we can only say that `res` is decreased by the first element of the sublist at index `l` in the list `a`.

The output state is:
- `ans` is 0 (unchanged)
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\) (unchanged)
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order (unchanged)
- `l` is `l + 1` (increased by 1)
- `r` is at least 1 (unchanged)
- `res` is now `res - a[l][0]`

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` lists of integers sorted based on the second element of each sublist in ascending order, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is at least 1, `res` is `res - a[l][0]`**
