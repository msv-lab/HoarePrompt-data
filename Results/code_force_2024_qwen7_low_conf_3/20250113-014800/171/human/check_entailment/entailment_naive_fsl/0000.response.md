Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time spent reading the set of messages according to the given formula. Specifically, the program sorts the messages based on `b_i` and then uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of messages that can be read within the given time limit `t`. However, the sorting step only considers `b_i`, which does not account for the absolute differences `|b_i - b_j|` between consecutive messages as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 8
4 3
1 5
2 4
4 3
2 3
```

The correct solution would include the calculation of `|b_i - b_j|` for the time spent reading the messages. The provided program does not include this part, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the correct answer for the above input should be 3, as explained in the example note, but the program might return an incorrect value due to the missing part of the formula.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the required logic to calculate the reading time according to the given formula.
