Reasoning:
1. The provided Python program seems to have a structure where it reads test cases and processes each one.
2. It defines `func_1()` which takes care of processing a single test case.
3. The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of messages `n` and the time limit `t`.
4. It then reads the characteristics of each message into a list of lists `a`.
5. The list `a` is sorted based on the second element of each sublist (`b_i`), which is correct as per the problem statement.
6. The algorithm then uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum set of messages whose total reading time does not exceed `t`. This part of the code correctly implements the logic:
   - It maintains a window `[l, r]` that expands to include more messages as long as the reading time remains within the limit.
   - If adding a new message exceeds the time limit, it shrinks the window from the left until the reading time is within the limit again.
   - It keeps track of the maximum size of the window encountered.
7. The function returns the maximum size of the set of messages found for the current test case.
8. The outer loop in the main program reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each one, printing the result.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
