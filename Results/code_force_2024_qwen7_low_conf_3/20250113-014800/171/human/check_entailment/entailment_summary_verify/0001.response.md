### Reasoning:

1. **Structure and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - Within each test case, it correctly reads the number of messages `n` and the time limit `t`.
   - It then reads the characteristics of each message into a list of lists `a`.

2. **Sorting Based on \( b_i \):**
   - The list `a` is sorted based on the second element of each sublist (`b_i`), which is correct as per the problem statement. This ensures that messages with smaller differences in \( b_i \) are processed first, potentially allowing for a larger number of messages within the time limit.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The sliding window approach is implemented correctly. It maintains two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the current window of messages.
   - The variable `res` keeps track of the cumulative reading time of the messages in the current window.
   - As the window expands (`r` increases), `res` is updated to include the reading time of the new message and the absolute difference between the \( b_i \) values of consecutive messages.
   - If `res` exceeds the time limit `t`, the window is adjusted by moving the left pointer `l` to the right until `res` is within the limit again.
   - The maximum size of the window (`r - l + 1`) is tracked and returned at the end of the function.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The sliding window approach correctly handles scenarios where the running sum `res` exceeds `t` early in the iteration. It adjusts the indices `l` and `r` appropriately to find the maximum valid subarray length.

5. **Function Summary Consistency:**
   - The provided function summary accurately describes the behavior of the `func_1()` function. It correctly outlines the steps and logic used to find the maximum set of messages within the given time limit.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. The sliding window approach is implemented accurately, and the function summary aligns well with the program's behavior.

**Final:** True
