### Reasoning:
1. **Structure and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - Within each test case, the function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of messages `n` and the time limit `t`.
   - It then reads the characteristics of each message into a list of lists `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted based on the second element of each sublist (`b_i`). This sorting step is crucial as it allows the algorithm to efficiently determine the maximum set of messages whose total reading time does not exceed `t`.

3. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - The algorithm uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum set of messages within the time limit:
     - It initializes pointers `l` and `r` to represent the current window.
     - It calculates the total reading time `res` of the current window.
     - If adding a new message (`a[r]`) exceeds the time limit, it adjusts the window by moving the left pointer `l` to the right until the reading time is within the limit again.
     - It updates the maximum size of the window (`ans`) whenever a larger valid window is found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases correctly, such as when the reading time exceeds the limit and needs to be adjusted.
   - The initialization of `l` and `r` ensures that the window starts from the beginning and expands as needed.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum size of the set of messages found for the current test case.
   - The outer loop in the main program prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. The function `func_1()` and the main program structure are sound and handle all aspects of the problem effectively.

**Final: True**
