Reasoning:
- The given program reads test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a value \( t \), followed by \( n \) pairs of integers \( a_i \) and \( b_i \).
- It processes each test case by sorting the pairs based on \( b_i \).
- The program then uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum subset of the pairs such that the sum of \( a_i \) values plus the absolute differences of consecutive \( b_i \) values does not exceed \( t \).
- The key steps in the program are:
  - Sorting the pairs based on \( b_i \).
  - Initializing variables to keep track of the current sum (`res`), the start index (`l`), and the result (`ans`).
  - Using a sliding window to adjust the start index (`l`) whenever the current sum exceeds \( t \).
  - Updating the maximum subset size (`ans`) whenever a valid subset is found.
- The provided execution summary accurately describes the functionality and logic of the program, including handling potential edge cases where the sum might exceed \( t \).

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to find the maximum possible size of the set of messages with a reading time not exceeding \( l \).

Correctness: **True**
