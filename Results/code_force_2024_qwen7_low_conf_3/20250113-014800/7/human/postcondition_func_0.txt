The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `tree` representing a graph where keys are integers (nodes) and values are lists of integers (neighbors), along with an integer `start_node` representing the starting node for a breadth-first search (BFS). It performs a BFS traversal from the `start_node` to compute the shortest distance from `start_node` to every other reachable node in the graph. After executing the function, it returns a dictionary named `distances` where each key is a node in the graph and the corresponding value is the shortest distance from the `start_node`. The function handles the case where a node might not be reachable from the `start_node`, as these nodes will not appear in the `distances` dictionary. The BFS ensures that all reachable nodes are processed level by level, guaranteeing that the shortest path is found. If the `start_node` is not within the valid range (1 <= start_node <= n), the function still executes correctly but the `distances` dictionary will only include nodes reachable from the specified `start_node`.
