The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\)) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges. Then, it calculates the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices using another function `func_1`. Afterward, it determines the maximum distance from vertex 1 to any other vertex and identifies all nodes at that maximum distance. The function then compiles a list of tuples containing the nodes at the maximum distance along with the distance value. If no nodes are found at the maximum distance, it includes the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` in the list. Finally, it returns a tuple consisting of the length of the list of operations and the list itself. This function effectively identifies and returns the nodes farthest from the starting point and their distances.
