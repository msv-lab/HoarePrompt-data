Postcondition: ***`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance from the starting point is equal to 1; `d` is 1; `max_distance` is a non-negative integer; `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. Otherwise, `nodes_at_d`, `d`, `max_distance`, and `operations` retain their initial states.***
