The code creates a list `nodes_at_d` containing nodes whose distance (`dist`) from a certain starting point is exactly equal to `d`. Since `d` is 0, `nodes_at_d` will include all nodes that have a distance of 0 from the starting point.

Initially:
- `d` is 0
- `max_distance` is a non-negative integer

After executing the code:
- `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with distance 0 from the starting point
- The value of `d` remains unchanged (still 0)
- The value of `max_distance` remains unchanged (still a non-negative integer)

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with distance 0 from the starting point, `d` is 0, `max_distance` is a non-negative integer**
