The code snippet `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. Given the initial conditions, the queue did not contain its leftmost element, and now it will contain the `neighbor` node. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`queue` contains its leftmost element plus `neighbor`; `node` is a key in `tree` with at least one remaining unprocessed neighbor; `tree` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node; `start_node` is an integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\); `distances` is a dictionary where the key is `start_node` and the value is `0`, and it includes the shortest distance from `start_node` to each reachable node; `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`.**
