The code snippet updates the `distances` dictionary by setting the distance to the `neighbor` node to `current_distance + 1`. This means that the distance from the `start_node` to the `neighbor` node is incremented by 1 compared to the previous known distance.

Given the initial state:
- `queue` does not contain its leftmost element.
- `node` is a key in `tree` with at least one remaining unprocessed neighbor.
- `tree` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node.
- `start_node` is an integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\).
- `distances` is a dictionary where the key is `start_node` and the value is `0`, and it includes the shortest distance from `start_node` to each reachable node.
- `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1` if `neighbor` is not in `distances`.

After executing the line `distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1`, the `distances` dictionary is updated to include the new distance to the `neighbor` node.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `queue` does not contain its leftmost element.
- `node` is a key in `tree` with at least one remaining unprocessed neighbor.
- `tree` remains unchanged.
- `start_node` remains unchanged.
- `distances` is updated such that `distances[neighbor]` is now `current_distance + 1`.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `node` is a key in `tree` with at least one remaining unprocessed neighbor, `tree` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node, `start_node` is an integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\), `distances` is a dictionary where the key is `start_node` and the value is `0`, and it includes the shortest distance from `start_node` to each reachable node, and `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`.**
