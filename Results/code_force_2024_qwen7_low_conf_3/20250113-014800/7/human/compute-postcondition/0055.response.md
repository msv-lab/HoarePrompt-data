The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tree` and `start_node`. 

- `tree` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes, and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node.
- `start_node` is an integer representing the starting node for the breadth-first search (BFS), such that 1 <= start_node <= n.

After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary named `distances` which maps each node in the graph that can be reached from the `start_node` to its shortest distance from the `start_node`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `tree` and an integer `start_node`, and return a dictionary mapping each reachable node to its shortest distance from the `start_node`.
