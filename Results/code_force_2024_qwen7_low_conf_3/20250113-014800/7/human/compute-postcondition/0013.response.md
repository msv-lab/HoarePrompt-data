The code snippet `max_distance = max(distances.values())` calculates the maximum value in the `distances` list and assigns it to the variable `max_distance`. This operation does not affect any other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree.
- `tree[u]` includes all vertices `v` connected to `u` through edges.
- `tree[v]` includes all vertices `u` connected to `v` through edges.
- `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is a list of all vertices connected to that key through the edges.
- `distances` is a list of integers where `distances[i-1]` is the distance from vertex 1 to vertex `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `operations` is an empty list.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `max_distance` is calculated as the maximum value in the `distances` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, `tree[u]` includes all vertices `v` connected to `u` through edges, `tree[v]` includes all vertices `u` connected to `v` through edges, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is a list of all vertices connected to that key through the edges, `distances` is a list of integers where `distances[i-1]` is the distance from vertex 1 to vertex `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive, `operations` is an empty list, `max_distance` is the maximum value in the `distances` list.**
