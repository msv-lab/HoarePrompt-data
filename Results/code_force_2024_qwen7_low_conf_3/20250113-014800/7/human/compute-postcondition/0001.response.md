To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(u, v)` in the `edges` list.
2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\).
   - `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree.
   - `distances` is a dictionary mapping each vertex to its distance from vertex 1.
   - `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, the list `edges` must contain at least one tuple. If `edges` is empty, the loop will not execute because there are no edges to iterate over.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- The list `edges` must have at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
- Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to consider any specific state changes inside the loop. We only need to ensure that the initial conditions allow the loop to run.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`edges` must have at least one tuple**.
