Postcondition: ***`node` has at least one neighbor in `tree`, `queue` is not empty, and after executing the if-else block, the current value of `neighbor` is either added to `queue` with `distances[neighbor]` set to `current_distance + 1` (if `neighbor` is not in `distances`), or `queue` remains unchanged if `neighbor` is already in `distances`. The current neighbor has been processed, and the next neighbor from `tree[node]` will be considered.***
