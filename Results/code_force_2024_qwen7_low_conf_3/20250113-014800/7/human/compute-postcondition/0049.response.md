`distances[neighbor]` is assigned the value of `current_distance + 1`. This means that the distance to the `neighbor` from the starting node (or the node currently being processed) is updated to be one more than the current distance. The preconditions that the `node` has at least one neighbor in `tree`, and `queue` is not empty, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` has at least one neighbor in `tree`, and `queue` is not empty; `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`**
