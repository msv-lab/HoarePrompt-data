The code initializes a dictionary called `tree` where each key is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is an empty list. This means that each vertex in the tree will initially have no edges connected to it.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\)
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree
- `distances` is a dictionary mapping each vertex to its distance from vertex 1

After executing the given code snippet, the `tree` dictionary is updated to reflect that each vertex has an empty list of edges. The values of `n`, `edges`, and `distances` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\); `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; `distances` is a dictionary mapping each vertex to its distance from vertex 1; `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is an empty list.**
