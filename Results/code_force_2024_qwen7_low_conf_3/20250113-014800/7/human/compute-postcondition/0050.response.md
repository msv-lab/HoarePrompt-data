The code appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The value of `neighbor` is such that it has at least one neighbor in `tree`, and `queue` is not empty. The `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`. After appending, the `queue` includes the `neighbor`.

Output State: **`node` has at least one neighbor in `tree`, and `queue` is not empty; `queue` contains the elements of its original contents plus `neighbor`; `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`**
