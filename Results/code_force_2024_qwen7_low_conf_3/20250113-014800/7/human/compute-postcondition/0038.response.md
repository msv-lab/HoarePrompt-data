The code assigns the value of `distances[node]` to the variable `current_distance`. This means that `current_distance` now holds the value from the `distances` dictionary corresponding to the key `node`. The `node` and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is the leftmost element of `queue`; `queue` is `queue` with its leftmost element removed; `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`**
