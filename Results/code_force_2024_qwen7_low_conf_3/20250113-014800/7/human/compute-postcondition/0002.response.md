The code `tree[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the list `tree[u]`. However, the initial values of `u` and `v` are not specified. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `v` has been appended to the list `tree[u]`.

Output State: **`edges` must have at least one tuple; `tree[u]` now includes `v`**
