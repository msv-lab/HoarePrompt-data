The code assigns `current_distance + 1` to `distances[neighbor]`. This means the distance of the `neighbor` from the starting node is updated to be one more than the `current_distance`. The `node`, `queue`, and the fact that the `neighbor` is not already in `distances` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` has at least one neighbor in `tree`, `queue` is not empty, the current value of `neighbor` is not in `distances`; `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`**
