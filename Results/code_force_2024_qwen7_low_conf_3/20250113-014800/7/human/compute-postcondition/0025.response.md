The code appends a tuple to the `operations` list. Specifically, it appends `(nodes_at_d[0], d)`. Given that `nodes_at_d` includes nodes at a distance of 2 from the starting point, `nodes_at_d[0]` refers to the first node in this list, and `d` is 2. Since `nodes_at_d` is not empty, the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 2)` is appended to `operations`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is updated to include nodes at a distance of 2 from the starting point, `d` is 2, `max_distance` is a non-negative integer, `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 2)`**
