Postcondition: ***`nodes_at_d` is updated to include nodes at a distance of 2 from the starting point. If `nodes_at_d` is not empty, `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 2)`. Otherwise, `operations` retains its initial state where it contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, otherwise it retains its initial state.***
