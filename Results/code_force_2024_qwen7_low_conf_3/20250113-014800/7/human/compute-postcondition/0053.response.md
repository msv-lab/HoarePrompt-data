Output State: **`queue` is empty, `node` is the last node processed in the BFS traversal, `distances` is a dictionary mapping each node in the graph that can be reached from the `start_node` to its shortest distance from the `start_node`, and `start_node` is an integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\).**
