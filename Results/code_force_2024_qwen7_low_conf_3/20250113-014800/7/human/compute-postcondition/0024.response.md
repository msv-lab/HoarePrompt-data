The code `nodes_at_d = [node for node, dist in distances.items() if dist == d]` iterates over the `distances` dictionary and collects nodes whose distance (`dist`) is equal to `d`. Given the initial state, `d` is 2, so it will collect nodes from `distances` where the distance is 2.

Since the initial state is that `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance from the starting point is equal to 1, and `d` is 2, the list `nodes_at_d` will be updated to include nodes that are at a distance of 2 from the starting point. The values of `d` and `max_distance` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this code. The `operations` variable will be updated to contain the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. If `nodes_at_d` is empty, the `operations` variable retains its initial state.

To summarize:
- `nodes_at_d` will be updated to include nodes that are at a distance of 2 from the starting point.
- `d` remains 2.
- `max_distance` remains unchanged.
- `operations` will be updated to contain `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, otherwise it retains its initial state.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is updated to include nodes at a distance of 2 from the starting point, `d` is 2, `max_distance` is a non-negative integer, `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, otherwise it retains its initial state.**
