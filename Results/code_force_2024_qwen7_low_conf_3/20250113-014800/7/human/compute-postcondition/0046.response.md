The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. This changes the value of `queue` by adding the `neighbor` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`node` has at least one neighbor in `tree`, `queue` is not empty and now includes the `neighbor`, `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`, and the next neighbor from `tree[node]` will be considered.**
