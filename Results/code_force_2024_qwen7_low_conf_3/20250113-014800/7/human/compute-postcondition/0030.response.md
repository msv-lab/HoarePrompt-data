Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\)) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges. Then, it calculates the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices using another function `func_1`. Afterward, it determines the maximum distance from vertex 1 to any other vertex and identifies all nodes at that maximum distance. The function then compiles a list of tuples containing the nodes at the maximum distance along with the distance value. If no nodes are found at the maximum distance, it includes the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` in the list. Finally, it returns a tuple consisting of the length of the list of operations and the list itself. This function effectively identifies and returns the nodes farthest from the starting point and their distances.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the tree is a path graph (all nodes are linearly connected), the maximum distance could be 1 (for leaf nodes).
- If the tree is a star graph (one central node connected to all others), the maximum distance would be \(n-1\).

Missing Functionality:
- The code assumes that `func_1` correctly computes the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so this is a critical assumption.
- The function does not handle cases where the input `edges` do not form a valid tree (e.g., multiple roots or cycles).
