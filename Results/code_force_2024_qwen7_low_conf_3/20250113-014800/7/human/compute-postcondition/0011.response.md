Output State: **`edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, `tree[u]` includes all vertices `v` connected to `u` through edges, `tree[v]` includes all vertices `u` connected to `v` through edges, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is a list of all vertices connected to that key through the edges, `distances` is a list of integers where `distances[i-1]` is the distance from vertex 1 to vertex `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive**.

Note: The function `func_1(tree, 1)` calculates the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree and returns this list of distances. The original values of `edges`, `tree`, and their associated relationships remain unchanged, but the new variable `distances` is introduced with the calculated distances.
