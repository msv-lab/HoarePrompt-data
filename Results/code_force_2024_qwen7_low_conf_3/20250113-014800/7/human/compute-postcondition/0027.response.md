Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with the maximum distance `max_distance` from the starting point, `d` is `max_distance`, `max_distance` is the maximum value in the `distances` list, and `operations` contains tuples `(nodes_at_d[i], max_distance)` for each node `nodes_at_d[i]` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. If `nodes_at_d` is empty, `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if it was added during previous iterations, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates from `d = 0` to `d = max_distance`. For each `d`, it finds all nodes at distance `d` from the starting point (vertex 1) and appends a tuple of the first such node and the distance `d` to the `operations` list.

2. **Final Iteration**: After the loop completes, `d` will be equal to `max_distance`, meaning the last iteration of the loop will process nodes at the maximum distance from the starting point.

3. **State of Variables**:
   - `nodes_at_d`: This list will contain all nodes at the maximum distance `max_distance` from the starting point. If no such nodes exist, this list will be empty.
   - `d`: This will be set to `max_distance`.
   - `max_distance`: This will remain the same as the initial `max_distance` because it is used to determine the range of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `operations`: This list will contain tuples of the form `(nodes_at_d[i], max_distance)` for each node at the maximum distance. If no nodes are found at the maximum distance, the list may still contain the tuple from the previous iteration(s).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the graph is a tree with no nodes at the maximum distance (`nodes_at_d` is empty), `operations` will contain the last added tuple, which is `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if such a node was added previously, otherwise it remains unchanged.

This final state reflects the outcome of the loop after processing all nodes at the maximum distance from the starting point.
