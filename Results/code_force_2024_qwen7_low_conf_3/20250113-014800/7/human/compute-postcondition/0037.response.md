`node` is assigned the value of the leftmost element in `queue` using the `popleft()` method. This removes that element from `queue`. The state of `queue` changes by removing the first element.

Output State: **`node` is the leftmost element of `queue`; `queue` is `queue` with its leftmost element removed.**
