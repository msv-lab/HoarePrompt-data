Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - The queue does not contain its leftmost element.
   - `node` is a key in `tree` with at least one neighbor.
   - `tree` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node.
   - `start_node` is an integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\).
   - `distances` is a dictionary where the key is `start_node` and the value is `0`, and it includes the shortest distance from `start_node` to each reachable node.
   - `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1` if `neighbor` is not in `distances`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `neighbor` for every `node` in `tree[node]`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `node` must still be a key in `tree` with at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` must be such that `neighbor` is not already in `distances` (or its distance needs to be updated).

4. **Modifications Needed:**
   - After processing each neighbor, the loop moves to the next neighbor. Therefore, `node` remains the same, but the list of neighbors changes as some neighbors get processed.
   - The condition that `neighbor` is not in `distances` or its distance needs to be updated ensures that only unprocessed neighbors are considered.

5. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop will continue as long as there are unprocessed neighbors for `node`, `node` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `neighbor` is not in `distances` or its distance needs to be updated ensures that the loop will continue until all neighbors are processed.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `queue` still does not contain its leftmost element.
- `node` is a key in `tree` with at least one remaining unprocessed neighbor.
- `tree` is the same dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node.
- `start_node` is the same integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\).
- `distances` is the same dictionary where the key is `start_node` and the value is `0`, and it includes the shortest distance from `start_node` to each reachable node.
- `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1` if `neighbor` is not in `distances`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `node` is a key in `tree` with at least one remaining unprocessed neighbor, `tree` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node, `start_node` is an integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\), `distances` is a dictionary where the key is `start_node` and the value is `0`, and it includes the shortest distance from `start_node` to each reachable node, and `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1` if `neighbor` is not in `distances`.**
