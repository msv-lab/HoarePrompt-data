The code appends a tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to the list `operations`. Here, `nodes_at_d[0]` is the first element in the list `nodes_at_d`, and `d` is currently 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated values are: `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with distance 0 from the starting point, `d` is 0, `max_distance` is a non-negative integer, and `nodes_at_d` is not empty; `operations` now contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 0)`.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with distance 0 from the starting point, `d` is 0, `max_distance` is a non-negative integer, and `nodes_at_d` is not empty; `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 0)`**
