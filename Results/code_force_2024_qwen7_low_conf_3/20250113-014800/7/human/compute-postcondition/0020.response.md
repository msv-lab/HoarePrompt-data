The code creates a new list `nodes_at_d` that contains nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance `dist` is equal to the current value of `d`. The original `nodes_at_d` list is updated with this new list. The `d` variable remains unchanged.

Let's denote the initial state of `distances` as a dictionary where each key is a node and each value is its distance from the starting point.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance from the starting point is equal to `d` (which is 1); `d` is 1; `max_distance` is a non-negative integer.**
