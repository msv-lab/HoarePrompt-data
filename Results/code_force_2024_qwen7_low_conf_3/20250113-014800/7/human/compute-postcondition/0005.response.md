The code `tree[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the list `tree[u]`. This means that the list `tree[u]` will now contain all its previous elements plus the new element `v`.

Given the initial state:
- `edges` must have at least one tuple;
- `tree[u]` now includes `v`;
- `tree[v]` now includes `u` (and possibly other elements).

After executing the code, `tree[u]` will include `v` in its list.

Output State: **`edges` must have at least one tuple; `tree[u]` now includes `v` and `tree[v]` now includes `u` (and possibly other elements)**
