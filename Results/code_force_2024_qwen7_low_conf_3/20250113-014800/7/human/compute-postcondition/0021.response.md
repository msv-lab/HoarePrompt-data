The code appends a tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to the `operations` list. Given that `d` is 1 and `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance from the starting point is equal to 1, the first element of `nodes_at_d` (i.e., `nodes_at_d[0]`) represents a node with distance 1. Therefore, the tuple added to `operations` is `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)`. 

The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance from the starting point is equal to 1; `d` is 1; `max_distance` is a non-negative integer; `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)`.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance from the starting point is equal to 1; `d` is 1; `max_distance` is a non-negative integer; `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)`**.
