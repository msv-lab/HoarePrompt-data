Output State: **`queue` does not contain its leftmost element, `node` is a key in `tree` with no remaining unprocessed neighbors, `tree` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node, `start_node` is an integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\), `distances` is a dictionary where the key is `start_node` and the value is `0`, and it includes the shortest distance from `start_node` to each reachable node, and if any neighbor of `node` was not in `distances`, `queue` contained its leftmost element plus that neighbor and `distances[neighbor]` was set to `current_distance + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to process nodes until there are no more unprocessed neighbors for the current node.
- Once the loop finishes, all reachable nodes from the `start_node` will have their shortest distances calculated and stored in the `distances` dictionary.
- The `queue` will eventually be processed such that it does not contain its leftmost element (indicating that all nodes have been processed).
- The `node` variable will be the last node that had neighbors processed, and these neighbors will have been added to the `queue` and their distances updated in the `distances` dictionary.
- If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., the initial `node` has no neighbors), then `distances` will only contain the entry for the `start_node` with a distance of 0, and `queue` will remain unchanged (though the problem statement indicates it does not contain its leftmost element, which would be the same as the initial state if the node has no neighbors).

Thus, the final state of the variables reflects the completion of the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm starting from `start_node`, ensuring that all reachable nodes have their shortest distances computed.
