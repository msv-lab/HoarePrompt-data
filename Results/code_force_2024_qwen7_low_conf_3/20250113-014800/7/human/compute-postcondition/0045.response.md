The code `distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1` updates the distance of the `neighbor` node in the `distances` dictionary to be `current_distance + 1`. This means that the `neighbor` node's distance from the starting node (`node`) is updated to be one more than the current node's distance (`current_distance`). The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` has at least one neighbor in `tree`, `queue` is not empty, `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`, and the next neighbor from `tree[node]` will be considered.**
