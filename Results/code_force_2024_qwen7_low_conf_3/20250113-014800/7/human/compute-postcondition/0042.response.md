The code appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The `neighbor` is added to the end of the queue, which means `queue` now includes all its previous elements plus the `neighbor`. The `node`, `distances`, and the fact that `queue` was not empty before the operation remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`node` has at least one neighbor in `tree`, `queue` is not empty and now includes `neighbor`, the current value of `neighbor` is not in `distances`; `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`**
