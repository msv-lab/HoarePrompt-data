According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `max_distance` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance from the starting point is equal to 1.
- `d` is 1.
- `max_distance` is a non-negative integer.
- `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. Otherwise, it retains its initial state.

To determine the states needed for the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration. Since `d` was 1, the next value of `d` would be 2 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `d < max_distance + 1` must still hold true. Given that `d` was 1, the next value of `d` is 2, and if `2 <= max_distance`, the loop will continue.

The key points to adjust are:
- The value of `d` should be updated to 2.
- The `operations` list will update based on the new value of `d`.

Since `nodes_at_d` remains unchanged until the current value of `d` is processed, we do not change its state unless `d` reaches a new value that affects it. In this case, `nodes_at_d` does not change because the loop is yet to process `d = 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `d` is 2.
- `max_distance` is unchanged and remains a non-negative integer.
- `operations` will contain the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty at `d = 2`. Otherwise, it retains its initial state.

State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance from the starting point is equal to 1; `d` is 2; `max_distance` is a non-negative integer; `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. Otherwise, `nodes_at_d`, `d`, `max_distance`, and `operations` retain their initial states.**
