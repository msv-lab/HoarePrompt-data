The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\), and `edges`, which is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree where each tuple `(u, v)` indicates an edge connecting vertices `u` and `v`. 

The function returns a tuple `(len(operations), operations)`, where `operations` contains tuples `(nodes_at_d[i], max_distance)` for each node `nodes_at_d[i]` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty; otherwise, it contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of edges `edges`, and return a tuple indicating the length of operations and the operations themselves, based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\)) and a parameter `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree). It returns a tuple `(len(operations), operations)`, where `operations` contains specific tuples based on the value of `nodes_at_d`.**
