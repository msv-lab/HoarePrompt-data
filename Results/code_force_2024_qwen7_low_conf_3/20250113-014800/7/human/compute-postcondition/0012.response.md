The code initializes an empty list named `operations`. This list does not affect the values of `edges`, `tree`, or `distances`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `operations` list.

Output State: **`edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, `tree[u]` includes all vertices `v` connected to `u` through edges, `tree[v]` includes all vertices `u` connected to `v` through edges, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is a list of all vertices connected to that key through the edges, `distances` is a list of integers where `distances[i-1]` is the distance from vertex 1 to vertex `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `operations` is an empty list.**
