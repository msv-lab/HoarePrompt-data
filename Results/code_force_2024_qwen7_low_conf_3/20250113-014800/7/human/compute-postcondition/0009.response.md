The code appends `u` to the list `tree[v]`. Given the initial state, `tree[v]` already includes `u` and possibly other elements. Appending `u` again does not change the fact that `u` is already in the list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`edges` must have at least two tuples, `tree[u]` now includes `v` and `v` (so `tree[u]` will have `v` listed twice) and possibly other elements, `tree[v]` now includes `u` and possibly other elements, `u` is in the list `tree[v]`**
