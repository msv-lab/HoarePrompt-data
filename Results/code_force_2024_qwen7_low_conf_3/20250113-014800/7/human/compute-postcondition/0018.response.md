Postcondition: ***`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with distance 0 from the starting point, `d` is 0, and `max_distance` is a non-negative integer. If `nodes_at_d` is not empty, `operations` is updated to include the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 0)`. If `nodes_at_d` is empty, `operations` remains unchanged.***
