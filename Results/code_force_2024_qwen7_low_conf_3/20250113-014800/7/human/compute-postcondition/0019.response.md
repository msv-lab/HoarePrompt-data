According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `max_distance` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with distance 0 from the starting point.
- `d` is 0.
- `max_distance` is a non-negative integer.

The loop updates `operations` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty by including the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 0)` and increments `d` by 1 for each iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to be 1.

To determine if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, we need to consider the condition under which `nodes_at_d` would remain unchanged. This would happen if `nodes_at_d` was empty in the previous iteration, meaning `operations` remained unchanged.

Let's summarize the states needed for the loop to execute one more time:

- If `nodes_at_d` was empty in the previous iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `nodes_at_d` should still be empty, and `d` should be incremented to 1.
- If `nodes_at_d` was not empty in the previous iteration, then `nodes_at_d` could still be non-empty in the current iteration, but since we are considering the transition to the next iteration, we assume it could be empty (since we are checking the condition for the next iteration).

Given this reasoning, the most general and safe assumption is that `nodes_at_d` could be either empty or non-empty, but `d` must be incremented to 1.

State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with distance 0 from the starting point, `d` is 1, and `max_distance` is a non-negative integer.**
