Output State: **`edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, `tree[u]` includes all vertices `v` connected to `u` through edges, `tree[v]` includes all vertices `u` connected to `v` through edges, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is a list of all vertices connected to that key through the edges.**
