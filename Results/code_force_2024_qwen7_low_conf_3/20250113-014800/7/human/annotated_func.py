#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighbors of the key node; start_node is an integer representing the starting node for the breadth-first search (BFS), such that 1 <= start_node <= n.
def func_1(tree, start_node):
    queue = deque([start_node])
    distances = {start_node: 0}
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        current_distance = distances[node]
        
        for neighbor in tree[node]:
            if neighbor not in distances:
                distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `node` is the last node processed in the BFS traversal, `distances` is a dictionary mapping each node in the graph that can be reached from the `start_node` to its shortest distance from the `start_node`, and `start_node` is an integer with \(1 \leq \text{start_node} \leq n\).
    return distances
    #`The program returns the dictionary 'distances' which maps each node in the graph that can be reached from the 'start_node' to its shortest distance from the 'start_node'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `tree` representing a graph where keys are integers (nodes) and values are lists of integers (neighbors), along with an integer `start_node` representing the starting node for a breadth-first search (BFS). It performs a BFS traversal from the `start_node` to compute the shortest distance from `start_node` to every other reachable node in the graph. After executing the function, it returns a dictionary named `distances` where each key is a node in the graph and the corresponding value is the shortest distance from the `start_node`. The function handles the case where a node might not be reachable from the `start_node`, as these nodes will not appear in the `distances` dictionary. The BFS ensures that all reachable nodes are processed level by level, guaranteeing that the shortest path is found. If the `start_node` is not within the valid range (1 <= start_node <= n), the function still executes correctly but the `distances` dictionary will only include nodes reachable from the specified `start_node`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree where each tuple (u, v) indicates an edge connecting vertices u and v, and distances is a dictionary mapping each vertex to its distance from vertex 1.
def func_2(n, edges):
    tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, `tree[u]` includes all vertices `v` connected to `u` through edges, `tree[v]` includes all vertices `u` connected to `v` through edges, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the corresponding value for each key is a list of all vertices connected to that key through the edges.
    distances = func_1(tree, 1)
    operations = []
    max_distance = max(distances.values())
    for d in range(max_distance + 1):
        nodes_at_d = [node for node, dist in distances.items() if dist == d]
        
        if nodes_at_d:
            operations.append((nodes_at_d[0], d))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes with the maximum distance `max_distance` from the starting point, `d` is `max_distance`, `max_distance` is the maximum value in the `distances` list, and `operations` contains tuples `(nodes_at_d[i], max_distance)` for each node `nodes_at_d[i]` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. If `nodes_at_d` is empty, `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` if it was added during previous iterations, otherwise it remains unchanged.
    return len(operations), operations
    #The program returns (len(operations), operations) where operations contains tuples (nodes_at_d[i], max_distance) for each node nodes_at_d[i] if nodes_at_d is not empty, otherwise it contains the tuple (nodes_at_d[0], 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\)) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges. Then, it calculates the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices using another function `func_1`. Afterward, it determines the maximum distance from vertex 1 to any other vertex and identifies all nodes at that maximum distance. The function then compiles a list of tuples containing the nodes at the maximum distance along with the distance value. If no nodes are found at the maximum distance, it includes the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], 1)` in the list. Finally, it returns a tuple consisting of the length of the list of operations and the list itself. This function effectively identifies and returns the nodes farthest from the starting point and their distances.
