### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to carefully analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the verification step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly implements a breadth-first search (BFS) to compute the shortest distances from a given start node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - The BFS uses a queue to traverse the tree level by level, and it correctly stores the distances in the `distances` dictionary.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the distances from node 1 to all other nodes.
   - The maximum distance from node 1 to any other node is calculated.
   - The function iterates over all possible distances from 0 to the maximum distance.
   - For each distance `d`, it collects all nodes that are exactly `d` distance away from the root node.
   - If there are such nodes, it adds an operation to color those nodes black and appends `(v, d)` to the `operations` list.

Let's verify if this approach meets the requirements:
- The BFS in `func_1` ensures that the distances are computed correctly.
- The construction of the tree in `func_2` and the collection of nodes at each distance ensure that all nodes are eventually colored black.
- However, there is a critical issue in how the function determines the nodes to color. Specifically, the function collects all nodes at the maximum distance and colors them in a single operation. This might not always be the optimal strategy because the problem requires the minimum number of operations.

Consider a simple example where the tree is a path with 4 nodes: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4. The distances from node 1 would be: `{1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3}`. According to the current implementation, the maximum distance is 3, and it would attempt to color nodes at distance 3 in one operation, but the optimal solution would be to color nodes at distance 1 and 2 in separate operations to minimize the number of operations.

Therefore, the function summary indicates that the function should identify and return the nodes farthest from the starting point and their distances, but the implementation in `func_2` does not always follow this requirement. Instead, it attempts to color all nodes at the maximum distance in a single operation, which might not be optimal.

### Conclusion:
**The original assessment is inaccurate because the function does not always ensure the minimum number of operations as required by the problem statement.**

### Final:
**False**
