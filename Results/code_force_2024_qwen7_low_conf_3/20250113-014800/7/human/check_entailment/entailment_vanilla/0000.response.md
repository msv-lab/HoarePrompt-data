### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to compute the shortest distances from a given start node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - The BFS is implemented correctly using a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
   - The distances are stored in the `distances` dictionary, which maps each node to its distance from the start node.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the distances from node 1 to all other nodes.
   - The maximum distance from node 1 to any other node is calculated.
   - The function then iterates over all possible distances from 0 to the maximum distance.
   - For each distance `d`, it collects all nodes that are exactly `d` distance away from the root node.
   - If there are such nodes, it adds an operation to color those nodes black and appends `(v, d)` to the `operations` list.

Let's verify if this approach meets the requirements:
- The BFS in `func_1` ensures that the distances are computed correctly.
- The construction of the tree in `func_2` and the collection of nodes at each distance ensure that all nodes are eventually colored black.
- The operations generated will color all nodes with the minimum number of steps because each operation targets nodes at a specific distance from the root, ensuring that all nodes are eventually covered without redundant coloring.

Given the above analysis, the functions appear to correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: True**
