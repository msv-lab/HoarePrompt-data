Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of operations to color all nodes in a tree black using the minimum possible number of operations. Each operation involves selecting a node and a distance to color all nodes at that distance from the selected node black.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from a given node (`start_node`). It calculates the shortest distance from the `start_node` to all other nodes in the tree. This is necessary to identify nodes at specific distances from a chosen node in subsequent steps.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function constructs the tree from the given edges and uses `func_1` to find the distances from node 1 to all other nodes. It then identifies the maximum distance and selects nodes at that distance to perform operations. The idea is to use the nodes at the maximum distance in each operation to color as many nodes as possible, ensuring the minimum number of operations.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Correctness of BFS Calculation**: `func_1` correctly performs BFS and calculates the shortest distances from the `start_node` to all other nodes.
   - **Identifying Nodes at Maximum Distance**: `func_2` correctly identifies nodes at the maximum distance from node 1. Using these nodes to perform operations ensures that the maximum number of nodes are colored in each operation.
   - **Sequence of Operations**: The sequence of operations constructed in `func_2` ensures that all nodes are eventually colored black. The use of nodes at the maximum distance in each operation guarantees that the tree is colored efficiently.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
