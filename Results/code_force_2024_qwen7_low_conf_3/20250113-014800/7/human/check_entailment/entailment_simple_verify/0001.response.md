### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's re-examine the functions and their interactions step-by-step.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function performs a BFS to compute the shortest distances from a given start node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - The BFS implementation is correct and uses a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
   - The distances are stored in the `distances` dictionary, which maps each node to its distance from the start node.
   - This part is accurate and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the distances from node 1 to all other nodes.
   - The maximum distance from node 1 to any other node is calculated.
   - The function then iterates over all possible distances from 0 to the maximum distance.
   - For each distance `d`, it collects all nodes that are exactly `d` distance away from the root node.
   - If there are such nodes, it adds an operation to color those nodes black and appends `(v, d)` to the `operations` list.

Now, let's validate if the approach ensures the minimum number of operations to color all nodes black:

- **Distance-Based Coloring Strategy:**
  - The strategy in `func_2` is to color nodes at increasing distances from the root node. Specifically, it colors all nodes at distance `d` before moving to nodes at distance `d+1`.
  - This ensures that no node is colored more than once since each node is only considered when its distance from the root is exactly `d`.
  - However, we need to ensure that this approach indeed colors all nodes in the minimum number of operations.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Tree Structure and BFS:**
  - The BFS in `func_1` correctly computes the shortest distances from the root node.
  - The adjacency list construction in `func_2` is also correct and allows efficient traversal.

- **Operation Generation:**
  - The operations are generated by collecting all nodes at a particular distance `d` and then appending `(v, d)` to the `operations` list.
  - Since the BFS ensures that nodes are visited in increasing order of their distance from the root, the operations generated will cover all nodes without redundancy.

- **Minimum Operations Requirement:**
  - The requirement is to color all nodes in the minimum number of operations, which is at most `n` operations.
  - The proposed strategy of coloring nodes at each distance level ensures that all nodes are covered without redundant coloring, thus meeting the requirement.

### Validation Against Example:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `edges = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`
  - Output: `2` operations: `(1, 1)` and `(2, 1)`
  - Explanation: Nodes at distance 1 from node 1 are nodes 2, 3, and 4. Node 1 is already the root, so it doesn't need an operation.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `n = 7`, `edges = [(2, 7), (3, 2), (6, 4), (5, 7), (1, 6), (6, 7)]`
  - Output: `3` operations: `(6, 1)`, `(7, 1)`, and `(2, 1)`
  - Explanation: Nodes at distance 1 from node 1 are nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6. Node 7 is at distance 2 from node 1, so it needs an additional operation to be colored black.

### Conclusion:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to color all nodes in the tree with the minimum number of operations. The BFS ensures accurate distance computation, and the operations generated ensure that all nodes are covered without redundancy.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
