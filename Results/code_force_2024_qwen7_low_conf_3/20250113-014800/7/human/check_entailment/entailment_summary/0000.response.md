Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to color all nodes in a tree black using the minimum number of operations. Each operation involves choosing a vertex `v` and a distance `d`, and coloring all nodes at distance `d` from `v`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function performs a BFS starting from a given node (`start_node`) to calculate the shortest distance from this node to all other nodes. This is essential for identifying which nodes are at a specific distance from a chosen node.
   - **func_2**: This function constructs the tree from the given edges, computes the distances from node 1 to all other nodes using `func_1`, and then iteratively selects the farthest nodes at each step until all nodes are colored. The logic ensures that we always color the maximum number of uncolored nodes per operation, minimizing the total number of operations required.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Edge Handling**: The code correctly handles the construction of the tree and the BFS for calculating distances. The BFS ensures that all reachable nodes are processed, and the distances are correctly computed.
   - **Operation Selection**: The selection of operations in `func_2` ensures that we always color the farthest nodes first, which is an optimal strategy for minimizing the number of operations. The process continues until all nodes are colored.
   - **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem's requirements, providing the minimum number of operations and the sequence of operations.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the functions' implementation, the program meets the problem description and correctly computes the minimum number of operations needed to color all nodes black.

Correctness: **True**
