Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for coloring all nodes in a tree black using the minimum number of operations. Specifically, the program `func_2` calculates distances from a start node (node 1 in this case) but does not ensure that all nodes are colored black with the minimum number of operations. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Operations**: The program calculates distances from node 1 and then iterates over these distances to select nodes. However, it does not guarantee that the selected nodes will cover all nodes in the tree. For instance, consider a tree where the structure is more complex than just a straight chain. For example, a star graph (a central node connected to all other nodes).

2. **Example Test Case Failing**:
   - Consider a star graph with 4 nodes where node 1 is the center and nodes 2, 3, and 4 are connected to node 1. The distances calculated from node 1 will be:
     - Node 1: 0
     - Nodes 2, 3, 4: 1
   - According to the program, it would select node 1 (distance 0) and nodes 2, 3, 4 (distance 1). This will indeed color all nodes, but it is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution would be to choose node 1 (distance 0) and then choose one of the leaf nodes (distance 1), which will also color all nodes in one additional step.

Given these points, the program does not guarantee the minimum number of operations in all cases, hence it is incorrect.
