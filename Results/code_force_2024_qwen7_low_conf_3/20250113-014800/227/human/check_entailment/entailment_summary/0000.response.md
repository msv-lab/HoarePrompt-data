Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem statement. It processes multiple test cases, reading an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\), and prints the minimum and maximum of these two numbers. The program's logic matches the requirements exactly, handling each test case appropriately and producing the expected output format.

Given that the program meets all the criteria outlined in the problem description, including handling a range of test cases from \(1\) to \(100\) and correctly identifying and printing the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
