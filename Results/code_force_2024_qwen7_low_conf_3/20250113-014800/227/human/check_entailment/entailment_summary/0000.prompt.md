You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))





# Execution Summary:
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it prints the minimum and maximum values of \(x\) and \(y\). The function reads an integer \(t\) representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value. Potential edge cases include \(t = 1\) (only one test case) and \(t = 100\) (maximum number of test cases). The function also handles invalid inputs by ensuring \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\) within each test case. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where \(x\) or \(y\) are outside this range, which could result in incorrect output.
