You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `t`, the print function has executed `t` times displaying the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each pair of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it prints the minimum and maximum values of \(x\) and \(y\). The function reads an integer \(t\) representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value. Potential edge cases include \(t = 1\) (only one test case) and \(t = 100\) (maximum number of test cases). The function also handles invalid inputs by ensuring \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\) within each test case. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where \(x\) or \(y\) are outside this range, which could result in incorrect output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program uses a loop to iterate over each test case, as specified.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
4. **Calculating Minimum and Maximum**: It correctly calculates the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` using the `min()` and `max()` functions.
5. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the results in the required format, with the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value.

Given that the program adheres to the problem description without any logical errors, it should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
