Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` separated by a space, ensuring they are within the range 0 to 9 (inclusive).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum values between `x` and `y` using the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively.
   - It then prints these values in the required format: the minimum value followed by the maximum value.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the results in the specified format for each test case, as shown in the example provided.

Since the program correctly processes each test case according to the given constraints and produces the expected output, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
