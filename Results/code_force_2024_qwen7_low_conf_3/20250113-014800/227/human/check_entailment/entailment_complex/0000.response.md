Reasoning:  
The annotated program correctly describes the logic and behavior of the given Python function. The function:

1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. Iterates through each test case, reading two integers `x` and `y`.
3. For each pair of integers `x` and `y`, it calculates the minimum and maximum values and prints them.

Given the constraints and the provided example, the function operates as expected. It handles the range of values for `x` and `y` correctly (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) and ensures that the output is always the minimum and maximum values for each test case.

Potential issues mentioned in the annotation, such as handling of invalid inputs, do not affect the correctness of the function as long as the input adheres to the specified constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100).

Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description and the provided example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
