Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the minimum of the two followed by the maximum. The logic for finding the minimum and maximum values is straightforward and works for all valid inputs within the specified range (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). There are no edge cases or specific inputs that this program does not handle correctly based on the problem description and the given examples.
