### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program uses a loop to iterate over each test case, as specified.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
4. **Calculating Minimum and Maximum**: It correctly calculates the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` using the `min()` and `max()` functions.
5. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the results in the required format, with the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value.

Given that the program adheres to the problem description without any logical errors, it should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
