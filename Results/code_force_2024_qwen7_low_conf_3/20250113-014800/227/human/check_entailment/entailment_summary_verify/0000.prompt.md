You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it prints the minimum and maximum values of \(x\) and \(y\). The function reads an integer \(t\) representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value. Potential edge cases include \(t = 1\) (only one test case) and \(t = 100\) (maximum number of test cases). The function also handles invalid inputs by ensuring \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\) within each test case. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where \(x\) or \(y\) are outside this range, which could result in incorrect output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the minimum of the two followed by the maximum. The logic for finding the minimum and maximum values is straightforward and works for all valid inputs within the specified range (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). There are no edge cases or specific inputs that this program does not handle correctly based on the problem description and the given examples.
