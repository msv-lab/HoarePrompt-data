The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The constraints provided (t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) suggest that the function processes multiple test cases internally. However, since no parameters are listed in the function definition, we need to focus on the output cases.

Given the output cases:

- Case_1: No specific output is mentioned here, but it implies that the function might handle some condition or return a value based on the input constraints.
- Case_2: The function returns a string "test_case" for each valid test case where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases with constraints on `t` (1 to 100) and `x` and `y` (0 to 9), and for each valid test case, it returns a string "test_case".

Functionality: **The function returns "test_case" for each valid test case where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.**
