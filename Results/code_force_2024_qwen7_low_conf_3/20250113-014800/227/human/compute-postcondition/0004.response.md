According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is 15, and `y` is 10. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is 15, `y` is 10**
