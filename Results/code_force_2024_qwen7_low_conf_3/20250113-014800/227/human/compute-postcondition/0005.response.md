`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The initial value of `t` is an integer provided by the user and remains unchanged. The initial value of `i` is 1 and remains unchanged. The initial value of `x` is 15 and is updated to the value of the first input. The initial value of `y` is 10 and is updated to the value of the second input. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer**
