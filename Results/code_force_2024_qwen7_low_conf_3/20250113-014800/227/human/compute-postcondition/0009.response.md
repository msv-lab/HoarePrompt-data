The code prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers `x` and `y`. The values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this code, so they remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are printed, but their values are not updated in the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, the output is the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.**
