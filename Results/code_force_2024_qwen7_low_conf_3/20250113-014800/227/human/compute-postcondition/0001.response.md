State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute if the value of `t` is at least 1.
2. The `range(t)` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, `t`.
3. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be 0, and `t` must be at least 1.
4. Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), this condition is already satisfied by the problem statement.

So, the initial state needs to include `i` being set to 0 to prepare for the first iteration of the loop.
