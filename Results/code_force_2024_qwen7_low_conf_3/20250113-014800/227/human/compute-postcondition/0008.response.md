The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state is that `t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and the print function has executed displaying the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.

After executing the code, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, but `x` and `y` are now assigned the values of the integers entered by the user. The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered.**
