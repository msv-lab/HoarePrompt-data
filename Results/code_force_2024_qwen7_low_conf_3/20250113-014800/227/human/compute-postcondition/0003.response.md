The code prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`. The values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this code, so they remain unchanged. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` are used to determine and print the minimum and maximum, but their own values are not changed.

Let's assume the inputs for `x` and `y` are given as follows (since specific values are not provided in the example):
- `x` is 15
- `y` is 10

The code will execute as follows:
- `min(x, y)` will be `10`
- `max(x, y)` will be `15`

After printing these values, the values of `t`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is 15, `y` is 10**
