`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input**
