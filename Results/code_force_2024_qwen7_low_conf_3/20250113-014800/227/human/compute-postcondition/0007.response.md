According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. The loop condition `i < t` must hold true for the loop to continue. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, and the print function has executed displaying the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration:
1. `i` is currently 1, and it needs to be incremented to 2 for the loop to continue.
2. `t` remains unchanged as it is determined by the input provided by the user.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 2, and `t` should remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, the print function has executed displaying the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.**
