The code prints the minimum and maximum of the two input integers `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `i`, `x`, and `y` are updated by the print function but not stored in any variable. After executing the code, `t` and `i` retain their initial values, while `x` and `y` are no longer available as they were used as inputs for the print function. Therefore, the output state will show that `t` and `i` retain their initial values, and the print function has executed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, the print function has executed displaying the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.**
