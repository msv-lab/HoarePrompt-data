Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `t`, the print function has executed `t` times displaying the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each pair of inputs.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `t` is an integer equal to the input provided by the user, and \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - In each iteration, the user inputs two integers `x` and `y`.
   - The `print(min(x, y), max(x, y))` statement outputs the minimum and maximum of the two integers.
3. **Final State**:
   - After all `t` iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`.
   - The print function will have executed `t` times, each time printing the minimum and maximum of the pair of integers provided by the user.

Since the loop executes exactly `t` times, all variables (`x` and `y`) will have been used up in the last iteration, and `i` will be equal to `t`.
