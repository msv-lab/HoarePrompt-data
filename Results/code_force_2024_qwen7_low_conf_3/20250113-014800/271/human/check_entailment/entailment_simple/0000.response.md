Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it adheres to the problem statement:

1. **Creation of Magic Words**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that generates `n` distinct magic words. Each magic word is a string of length between 1 and 30 * n, consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'.
   - The magic words are stored in a list and printed out, ensuring each word is unique and meets the length constraints.
   
2. **Power Calculation**:
   - The program uses `func_2` to calculate the power of a spell, which is defined as the number of different non-empty substrings of the concatenated string formed by two magic words.
   - The function correctly counts all unique substrings and returns the count, ensuring it matches the problem's requirement.

3. **Handling Student Queries**:
   - For each query, the program reads the power of the spell from the input.
   - It then uses `func_3` to find the indices of the two magic words that produce the given power. 
   - `func_3` iterates over all pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and uses `func_2` to check if the power matches the given value. If a match is found, it returns the indices (1-based).

4. **Interaction Protocol**:
   - The program follows the interaction protocol as described, reading and writing to standard input/output as required.
   - It ensures the output is flushed after each print statement, adhering to the requirement for interaction problems.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description and handles all cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
