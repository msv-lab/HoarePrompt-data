You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value
of n .

Professor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to
prepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string
consisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating
two magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its
different non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is
equal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and
XOXO.

Each student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.
Since the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of
the two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided
by Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a
student chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of
their spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,
and of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out
which two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.

Your program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n
distinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the
spell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the
correct order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.

Interaction

This is an interactive problem.

First, your program should read a single integer n (1 \le n \le 30 ), the
number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has
created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must
have at least 1 and at most 30\cdot n characters, and each character must be
either X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \le i
\le n ).

Then, your program should read a single integer q (1 \le q \le 1000 ), the
number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process
q times, one per student.

For the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power
of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two
indices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n
inclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of
different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program
must print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \le u_j, v_j \le n ).

Note that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a
spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student
in the exact order.

Remember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after
printing u_j and v_j for each student.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import random

n = int(input())
magic_words = func_1(n)
for word in magic_words:
    print(word)
print(flush=True)
q = int(input())
for _ in range(q):
    power = int(input())
    (u, v) = func_3(magic_words, power)
    print(u, v)
    print(flush=True)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30.
def func_1(n):
    magic_words = []
    for _ in range(n):
        length = random.randint(1, 30 * n)
        
        word = ''.join(random.choice(['X', 'O']) for _ in range(length))
        
        magic_words.append(word)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30; `magic_words` is a list containing `n` strings, each string is a random sequence of characters from ['X', 'O'] of length between 1 and 30 * `n`.
    return magic_words
    #`magic_words` is a list containing `n` strings, each string is a random sequence of characters from ['X', 'O'] of length between 1 and 30 * `n`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and the length of s is at least 1 and at most 150 (since the maximum length of a magic word is 30 * n and n can be up to 30).
def func_2(s):
    substrings = set()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substrings.add(s[i:j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is the length of `s` + 1, `substrings` contains all possible substrings of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'
    return len(substrings)
    #The program returns the number of all possible substrings of string 's'

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: magic_words is a list of strings representing the distinct magic words created by the program, and power is an integer representing the power of the spell provided by the student. Each string in magic_words consists of characters 'X' and 'O', and the length of each string is between 1 and 30*n inclusive.
def func_3(magic_words, power):
    for i in range(len(magic_words)):
        for j in range(len(magic_words)):
            spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
            if func_2(spell) == power:
                return i + 1, j + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is the index of the last element in `magic_words` (i.e., `len(magic_words) - 1`), `j` is the index of the last element in `magic_words` (i.e., `len(magic_words) - 1`), `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)`, otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    return -1, -1
    #The program returns (-1, -1)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
