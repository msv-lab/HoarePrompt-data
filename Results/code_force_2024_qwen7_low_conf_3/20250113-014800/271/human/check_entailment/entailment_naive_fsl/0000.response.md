Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate the magic words and solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_3` attempts to find the correct pair of magic words that, when concatenated, produce a spell with the given power. However, the implementation of `func_2` to calculate the power of a spell has a logical error. It should consider the concatenation of two words but instead it treats each word separately, which does not accurately represent the problem's requirement.

The issue arises because `func_2` calculates the number of unique substrings for a single string, not for the concatenation of two strings. To fix this, `func_2` needs to correctly handle the concatenation of two strings and calculate the power accordingly. The current implementation of `func_2` will not correctly determine the power of a spell formed by concatenating two magic words.
