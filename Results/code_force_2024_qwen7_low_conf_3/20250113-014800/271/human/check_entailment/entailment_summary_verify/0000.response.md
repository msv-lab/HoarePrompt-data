### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the code and the problem description to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates `n` distinct magic words of random lengths (between 1 and 30*n characters) consisting of 'X' and 'O'.
   - The magic words are stored in a list and returned.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the number of distinct non-empty substrings of a given string `s`.
   - It iterates over all possible substrings and adds them to a set to ensure uniqueness.
   - Finally, it returns the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct substrings.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function takes a list of magic words and a target power.
   - It iterates over all pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and uses `func_2` to calculate the power of the resulting spell.
   - If the calculated power matches the target power, it returns the 1-based indices of the two magic words.
   - If no matching pair is found, it returns `(-1, -1)`.

### Analysis:

- **Problem Description**:
  - The problem requires generating `n` distinct magic words and then determining the indices of the two words that were concatenated to form a spell with a given power.
  - The power of a spell is the number of distinct non-empty substrings of the concatenated string.

- **Current Implementation**:
  - The `func_2` function correctly calculates the number of distinct substrings for a given string.
  - The `func_3` function correctly iterates over all pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and checks if the calculated power matches the target power using `func_2`.

Given the above analysis, the implementation of `func_2` and `func_3` aligns with the problem requirements. The logic in `func_3` ensures that it correctly identifies the pair of magic words that form a spell with the given power.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the implementation. The program correctly implements the required logic to generate the magic words and determine the indices of the two words that form a spell with the given power.

**Final: True**
