### Reasoning:

1. **Magic Word Generation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly generates `n` distinct magic words of random lengths between 1 and \(30 \cdot n\) characters. Each character in the magic words is either 'X' or 'O'. This part is correct and ensures the generation of distinct strings as required.

2. **Power Calculation:**
   - The `func_2` function calculates the number of different non-empty substrings of a given spell. This function correctly implements the logic to find all unique substrings using nested loops, which is accurate.

3. **Spell Power Verification:**
   - The `func_3` function attempts to find the indices of the two magic words that produce a spell with the given power. It does so by iterating over all pairs of magic words, concatenating them, and checking if the power of the resulting spell matches the given power. If a match is found, it returns the indices of the two words. This logic is sound and works as intended.

4. **Interaction Protocol Compliance:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `q`, prints `n` magic words, and then processes `q` queries. For each query, it reads the spell power and prints the indices of the two magic words that form the spell with the given power. This interaction follows the specified protocol.

5. **Edge Cases and Validations:**
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly. It ensures that the generated magic words are distinct, have valid lengths, and the indices returned are within the required bounds.

However, there is a critical flaw in the `func_3` function. Specifically, when searching for the correct pair of magic words, the function does not account for the possibility that the two words might be identical (i.e., `i == j`). Since the problem states that each student can choose the same word twice, we need to ensure that both indices are checked properly.

In the current implementation, the function only checks pairs where `i` and `j` are different. This means that if a student uses the same word twice, the function will incorrectly report `-1, -1`.

To fix this, we need to include the case where `i == j` in the search loop. This would involve modifying the loop in `func_3` to include the diagonal elements (where `i == j`).

### Example Fix:
```python
def func_3(magic_words, power):
    for i in range(len(magic_words)):
        for j in range(len(magic_words)):
            spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
            if func_2(spell) == power:
                return (i + 1, j + 1)
    return (-1, -1)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the program fails to handle the case where the two magic words are identical, which is a valid scenario according to the problem statement.

### Final:
**False**
