Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that there is an issue with the implementation of `func_2`. The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the number of unique non-empty substrings of a given spell, which is the result of concatenating two magic words. However, the current implementation of `func_2` treats the input string `s` as a single word and calculates the number of unique substrings within that word, rather than considering the concatenated result of two words.

To properly calculate the power of a spell, we need to concatenate the two magic words and then calculate the number of unique non-empty substrings of the resulting string. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results.

However, let's re-evaluate the annotated code to see if there might be any other issues or if the original assessment might have overlooked something.

1. The function `func_1` generates `n` distinct magic words, each of which is a random sequence of 'X' and 'O'.
2. The function `func_2` calculates the number of unique non-empty substrings of a given string `s`. This part is currently implemented incorrectly.
3. The function `func_3` iterates over all pairs of magic words and checks if the concatenation of these two words results in a spell with the given power using `func_2`.

Given the annotated code, the issue is indeed with `func_2`. It should concatenate the two magic words before calculating the number of unique substrings. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that `func_2` is implemented incorrectly.

To correct this, we would need to modify `func_2` to concatenate the two strings before calculating the number of unique substrings. Here's how `func_2` could be corrected:

```python
def func_2(s):
    substrings = set()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substrings.add(s[i:j])
    return len(substrings)
```

Since the core issue lies in the incorrect implementation of `func_2`, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
