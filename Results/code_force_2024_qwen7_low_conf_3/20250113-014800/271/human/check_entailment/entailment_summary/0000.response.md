Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates `n` distinct magic words, each of which is a random sequence of 'X' and 'O'.
   - The length of each magic word is between 1 and `30 * n`, ensuring that the generated strings meet the length constraints specified in the problem.
   - The function ensures that all generated magic words are unique by simply adding them to the list one by one.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the power of a spell, which is defined as the number of different non-empty substrings of a given string.
   - It uses a set to collect all substrings, ensuring that duplicates are not counted.
   - The function correctly handles strings of lengths ranging from 1 to 150, which is sufficient to cover all possible spell lengths since the longest possible spell would be `30 * n + 30 * n = 60 * n` (though `n` is capped at 30).

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function takes a list of magic words and a target power.
   - It iterates over all possible pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and checks if the power of the resulting spell matches the target power using `func_2`.
   - If a match is found, it returns the 1-based indices of the two magic words.
   - If no match is found, it returns `(-1, -1)`.

Given that:
- `func_1` generates valid magic words.
- `func_2` accurately calculates the power of a spell.
- `func_3` correctly identifies the magic words used to form a spell with the given power.

The entire program follows the problem's specifications and logic correctly. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
