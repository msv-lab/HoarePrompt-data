The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, where `1 <= n <= 30`. It generates a list `magic_words` containing `n` strings. Each string in the list is a random sequence of characters chosen from `['X', 'O']`, and the length of each string is randomly determined to be between 1 and `30 * n`. After executing the function, `magic_words` is a list containing `n` such strings. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that require special handling, and the code as written does not seem to be missing any functionality relevant to the stated postconditions.
