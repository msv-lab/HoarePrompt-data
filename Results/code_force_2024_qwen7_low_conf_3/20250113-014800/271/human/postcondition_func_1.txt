The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and the length of `s` is at least 1 and at most 150. It generates all possible substrings of `s` by iterating through every possible starting and ending index of the string. After collecting these substrings in a set to ensure uniqueness, it returns the total count of these substrings. This count represents the number of all possible substrings of `s`. Potential edge cases include strings of minimum and maximum length (1 and 150, respectively), as well as strings consisting solely of 'X', 'O', or any combination thereof. The function does not modify the input string `s`.
