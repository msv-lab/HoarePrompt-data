    for _ in range(n):
        length = random.randint(1, 30 * n)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30; `magic_words` is a list containing `n` strings, each string is a random sequence of characters from ['X', 'O'] of length between 1 and 30 * `n`.
    return magic_words
    #`magic_words` is a list containing `n` strings, each string is a random sequence of characters from ['X', 'O'] of length between 1 and 30 * `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, where `1 <= n <= 30`. It generates a list `magic_words` containing `n` strings. Each string in the list is a random sequence of characters chosen from `['X', 'O']`, and the length of each string is randomly determined to be between 1 and `30 * n`. After executing the function, `magic_words` is a list containing `n` such strings. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that require special handling, and the code as written does not seem to be missing any functionality relevant to the stated postconditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and the length of s is at least 1 and at most 150 (since the maximum length of a magic word is 30 * n and n can be up to 30).
def func_2(s):
    substrings = set()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substrings.add(s[i:j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is the length of `s` + 1, `substrings` contains all possible substrings of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'
    return len(substrings)
    #The program returns the number of all possible substrings of string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and the length of `s` is at least 1 and at most 150. It generates all possible substrings of `s` by iterating through every possible starting and ending index of the string. After collecting these substrings in a set to ensure uniqueness, it returns the total count of these substrings. This count represents the number of all possible substrings of `s`. Potential edge cases include strings of minimum and maximum length (1 and 150, respectively), as well as strings consisting solely of 'X', 'O', or any combination thereof. The function does not modify the input string `s`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: magic_words is a list of strings representing the distinct magic words created by the program, and power is an integer representing the power of the spell provided by the student. Each string in magic_words consists of characters 'X' and 'O', and the length of each string is between 1 and 30*n inclusive.
def func_3(magic_words, power):
    for i in range(len(magic_words)):
        for j in range(len(magic_words)):
            spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
            if func_2(spell) == power:
                return i + 1, j + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is the index of the last element in `magic_words` (i.e., `len(magic_words) - 1`), `j` is the index of the last element in `magic_words` (i.e., `len(magic_words) - 1`), `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)`, otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    return -1, -1
    #The program returns (-1, -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power`. It searches through all possible pairs of strings in `magic_words`, concatenates them, and passes the result to `func_2`. If `func_2` returns a value equal to `power`, the function returns the 1-based indices of the two strings that form the correct pair. If no such pair is found, the function returns `(-1, -1)`. The function does not modify the input list `magic_words`.
