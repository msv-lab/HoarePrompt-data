State before the loop starts: `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 1, `j` is the length of `magic_words`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `j` is initialized to the length of `magic_words`. This means that `j` is initially set to the number of elements in the list `magic_words`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(len(magic_words))` will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`.
3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words` at the start of the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `j` is less than the length of `magic_words` when the loop starts. However, the initial value of `j` is equal to the length of `magic_words`, which means the loop will not execute because `j` is not less than itself.

Therefore, we need to adjust the initial value of `j` to be one less than the length of `magic_words` so that the loop can start executing.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 1, `j` is the length of `magic_words` - 1**
