According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(magic_words)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is the length of `magic_words`.
- `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`.
- `func_2(spell) != power`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words`. Since `j` is currently equal to the length of `magic_words`, it needs to be decreased by 1 to enter the next iteration.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `i` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop iterating over `j`.
- `j` decreases by 1, so it becomes `len(magic_words) - 1`.
- The condition `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]` remains unchanged.
- The condition `func_2(spell) != power` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 0, `j` is len(`magic_words`) - 1, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`**
