Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is the length of `magic_words` - 1.
   - `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[j]`.
   - `func_2(spell) != power`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from its current value (length of `magic_words` - 1) to 0.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1 and not part of the loop, it remains unchanged.
   - `j` is currently the length of `magic_words` - 1.
   - `spell` is already defined as the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[j]`.
   - The condition `func_2(spell) != power` must hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will now be `len(magic_words) - 2`.
   - The new `spell` will be the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[j-1]`, which is `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes `len(magic_words) - 2`.
   - `spell` is updated to the new concatenation.
   - The condition `func_2(spell) != power` must still hold true.

Based on these steps, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 1, `j` is len(`magic_words`) - 2, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`**.
