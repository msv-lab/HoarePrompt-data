Functionality: **The function `func_3` takes a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power`. It searches through all possible pairs of strings in `magic_words`, concatenates them, and passes the result to `func_2`. If `func_2` returns a value equal to `power`, the function returns the 1-based indices of the two strings that form the correct pair. If no such pair is found, the function returns `(-1, -1)`. The function does not modify the input list `magic_words`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that `magic_words` is non-empty, but it does not explicitly handle the case where `magic_words` is empty.
- The function returns `(-1, -1)` if no valid pair is found, but it does not specify whether this is the only condition under which `(-1, -1)` is returned. According to the annotated code, `(-1, -1)` is also returned at the end of the function, which might imply that the function always returns `(-1, -1)` if no valid pair is found during the loop.

**Summary of the final state after the function concludes:**
- The function will either return the 1-based indices of the two strings in `magic_words` whose concatenation matches the specified `power` value (`(i + 1, j + 1)`), or it will return `(-1, -1)` if no such pair is found.
