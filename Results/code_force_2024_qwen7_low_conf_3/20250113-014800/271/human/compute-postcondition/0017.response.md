Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is the length of `magic_words`.
   - `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j-1]`.

2. Code Execution:
   - The line `spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` is executed.
     - `i` is 0, so `magic_words[i]` is the first element in the list `magic_words`.
     - `j` is the length of `magic_words`, so `magic_words[j]` refers to the last element in the list (since list indices start from 0).

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `spell` is updated to the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[j-1]`, which is the same as `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`.

4. Updated Values:
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` remains the length of `magic_words`.
   - `spell` is now the concatenation of the first and last elements of `magic_words`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 0, `j` is the length of `magic_words`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`**.
