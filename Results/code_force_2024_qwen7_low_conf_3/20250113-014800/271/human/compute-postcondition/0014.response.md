Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is the length of `magic_words`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j-1]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns `(i + 1, j)`. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are the same as when the loop ends.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 0.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs over each `j` from `0` to `len(magic_words) - 1`.
   - For each iteration, `spell` is updated as the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.
   - The condition `func_2(spell) == power` is checked.
   - If the condition is met, the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)`, where `i` is the current value of `i` and `j` is the last value it took in the loop.

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a match (`func_2(spell) == power`), `i` and `j` will be the last values they took in the loop.
   - `j` will be `len(magic_words) - 1` because the loop iterates up to `len(magic_words) - 1`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables are as described above. If the loop does not execute, the initial values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
