Postcondition: ***`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least two strings, `j` is 3, and `spell` is `magic_words[2] + magic_words[2]`. If `func_2(spell) == power`, then the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)`, where `i` is not defined in the return statement but is referenced as `i + 1`. Since `j` is initially 2, `j + 1` is 3.***
