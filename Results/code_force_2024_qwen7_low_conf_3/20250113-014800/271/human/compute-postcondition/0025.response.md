Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `len(magic_words) - 1`.
   - `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`.
   - If `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns `(1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or returns `None`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(len(magic_words))`.
   - This means `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(magic_words) - 1`.

3. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `len(magic_words) - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Since `j` is currently `len(magic_words) - 1`, the next value of `j` would be `len(magic_words)`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged and is still 0.
   - `j` changes to `len(magic_words)`.
   - `magic_words` remains the same list of strings.
   - `spell` will be recalculated as `magic_words[0] + magic_words[-1]` for the new value of `j`.

Given this analysis, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(magic_words)`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`.**
