Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `len(magic_words) - 2`.
   - `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`.
   - The postcondition is that if `func_2(spell) == power`, the program returns `(2, len(magic_words) - 1)`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(len(magic_words)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `j` is being incremented from its initial value of `len(magic_words) - 2` to `len(magic_words) - 1`.
   - The loop will stop when `j` reaches `len(magic_words)`, because the loop condition is `range(len(magic_words))`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts at `len(magic_words) - 2` and the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, the next value of `j` will be `len(magic_words) - 1`.
   - `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - The list `magic_words` does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `spell` is based on the values of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`, which remain unchanged.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `magic_words` is still a list of strings with at least one string.
   - `i` is still 1.
   - `j` is now `len(magic_words) - 1`.
   - `spell` remains the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(magic_words) - 1`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`**.
