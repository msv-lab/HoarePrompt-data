Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
- `j` is 0.
- `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[j]` and `magic_words[0]`.
- `func_2(spell) != power`.

### Understanding the Loop:
The loop iterates over the indices of `magic_words` using `range(len(magic_words))`. The variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Current Values:
- `j` is currently 0.
- `spell` is `magic_words[j] + magic_words[0]`.

### Condition for Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(magic_words)`. Since `j` starts at 0, it will increment to 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, the loop can execute if there are at least two elements in `magic_words`.

### Adjusting States:
- `magic_words` must still be a list of strings with at least one string (since we need at least two elements for the next iteration).
- `j` will be incremented to 1.
- `spell` will be updated to `magic_words[1] + magic_words[0]`.

### Final State:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
- `j` is 1.
- `spell` is `magic_words[1] + magic_words[0]`.
- The condition `func_2(spell) != power` remains unchanged since the function call is based on the current value of `spell`.

### Answer:
State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `j` is 1, `spell` is `magic_words[1] + magic_words[0]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`**
