Postcondition: ***`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(magic_words) - 2`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the program returns `(2, len(magic_words) - 1)`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as specified in the precondition.***
