The code `spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` impacts the program by updating the value of `spell`. According to the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(magic_words)`. Given that `magic_words` is a list with at least one string, `magic_words[0]` refers to the first element in the list and `magic_words[-1]` refers to the last element in the list. Since `j` is `len(magic_words)`, `magic_words[j]` would refer to the last element in the list as well, which is `magic_words[-1]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`, which is already the case in the initial state. However, the code reassigns `spell` to this concatenation, meaning `spell` is now explicitly the concatenation of the first and last elements of `magic_words`.

The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(magic_words)`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`**
