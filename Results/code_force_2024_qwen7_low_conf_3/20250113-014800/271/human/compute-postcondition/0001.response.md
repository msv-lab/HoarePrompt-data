According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `magic_words` and the variable `j`.

1. The loop starts with `j` initialized to 0.
2. For the loop to execute, `magic_words` must have at least one string. This ensures that `len(magic_words)` is at least 1, allowing the range function to generate at least one value for `j`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state such that `magic_words` has at least one string and `j` is initialized to 0.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings that must have at least one string, `j` is 0**
