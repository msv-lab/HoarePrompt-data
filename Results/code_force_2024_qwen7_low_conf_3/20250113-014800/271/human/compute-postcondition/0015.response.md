Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is the length of `magic_words`.
- `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j-1]`.
- The loop returns `(i + 1, j)` if `func_2(spell) == power`, otherwise it does not return and `i` and `j` remain the same.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(magic_words)`.
2. **Variable `i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration unless the condition `func_2(spell) == power` is met.
3. **Variable `j`**: This remains constant throughout the loop since it is the length of `magic_words`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(magic_words)`.
3. **Increment of `i`**: If the condition `func_2(spell) == power` is not met, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of the current iteration.
4. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` needs to be increased by 1.
   - `j` remains the same as it is the length of `magic_words` and does not change within the loop.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- Since we need to check the next element in `magic_words`, `i` will be increased by 1.
- `j` remains the same as it is the length of `magic_words`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is the length of `magic_words`.
- `spell` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### Updated State:
State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the length of `magic_words`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j-1]`**.

However, since the exact value of `i` is not given, we represent it as `i + 1`.

Final Answer:
State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the length of `magic_words`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j-1]`**.
