Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is the length of `magic_words`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(len(magic_words)):
    spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
    if func_2(spell) == power:
        return i + 1, j + 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `len(magic_words) - 1`.
- On each iteration, it constructs `spell` as the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.
- It checks if `func_2(spell)` equals `power`.
- If the condition is met, it returns `(i + 1, j + 1)` and the loop terminates.

### Observations from the Provided Output States:
- After 1 iteration, `j` is set to `len(magic_words) - 1` and `spell` is constructed with `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 1]`.
- After 2 iterations, `j` is set to `len(magic_words) - 2` and `spell` is constructed with `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`.
- After 3 iterations, `j` is set to `len(magic_words) - 1` again, and `spell` is constructed with `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[len(magic_words) - 2]`.

### Final State Analysis:
- The loop continues to iterate until it either finds a match for `func_2(spell) == power` or exhausts all possible pairs.
- If the loop finds a match, it returns `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- If the loop does not find a match, it means that for every `j` from 0 to `len(magic_words) - 1`, the condition `func_2(spell) != power` holds true.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop finds a match, `i` will be 1 and `j` will be the index such that `func_2(magic_words[1] + magic_words[j]) == power`, and the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- If the loop does not find a match, `i` will still be 1, `j` will be `len(magic_words) - 1`, and the function will return `None` or an indication that no match was found.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `magic_words` (i.e., `len(magic_words) - 1`), `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[1]` and `magic_words[j]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns `(2, j + 1)`, otherwise, the function returns `None`.**
