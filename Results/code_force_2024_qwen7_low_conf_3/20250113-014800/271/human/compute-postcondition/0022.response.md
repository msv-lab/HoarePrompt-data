The code `spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` updates the value of `spell` by concatenating the string at index `i` (which is `0`) and the string at index `j` (which is `len(magic_words) - 1`). Given the initial state, `i` is `0` and `j` is `len(magic_words) - 1`. Therefore, `spell` is updated to be the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`.

The initial state also mentions that `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`. This condition remains unchanged as the code does not call `func_2` or modify `power`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is 0, `j` is len(`magic_words`) - 1, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[0]` and `magic_words[-1]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`.**
