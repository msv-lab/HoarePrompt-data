The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `magic_words`, which is a list of strings representing distinct magic words created by the program, and `power`, which is an integer representing the power of the spell provided by the student. Each string in `magic_words` consists of characters 'X' and 'O', and the length of each string is between 1 and 30*n inclusive.

Based on the given cases, the function returns different tuples depending on the values of `i` and `j`, which are not explicitly defined in the function's signature or documentation. However, the output provides some context about the possible return values.

The functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power`, and return a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` under certain conditions, with specific return values outlined in the provided cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `magic_words` (a list of strings) and `power` (an integer), and returns a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` based on the specified conditions.**
