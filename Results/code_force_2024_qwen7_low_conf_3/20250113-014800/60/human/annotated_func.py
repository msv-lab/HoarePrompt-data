#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, x and y are non-negative integers, and s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= x <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= y <= 2 * 10^5, and 0 <= s <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, x, y, s):
    sequence = [x]
    current_sum = x
    for i in range(1, n):
        if current_sum + y <= s and (s - current_sum - y) % y == 0:
            sequence.append(sequence[-1] + y)
            current_sum += y
        else:
            sequence.append(sequence[-1] % y)
            current_sum += sequence[-1]

            return None
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is a list where the first element is `x`, and each subsequent element depends on the previous element and the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, each element in the sequence after the first one is either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y` based on whether adding `y` to `current_sum` would exceed `s` or not. `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence`. If at any point `current_sum` exceeds `s`, the sequence is reset to `[x, x % y]` and `current_sum` is reset to `x + (x % y)` if this condition occurs.
    if (current_sum == s) :
        return sequence
        #`sequence` is [x, x % y] and `current_sum` is x + (x % y) because the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence` equals `s` and no further elements were added to `sequence` before `current_sum` exceeded `s`
    else :
        return None
        #None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` generates a sequence based on specified conditions and returns either the sequence or `None`. The sequence starts with `x` and each subsequent element is either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y` depending on whether adding `y` to the current sum `current_sum` would exceed `s`. If `current_sum` equals `s`, the function returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`. Edge cases include handling `n == 0` and resetting the sequence and `current_sum` if `current_sum` exceeds `s` on the first iteration.
