### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing the sequence with the first element `x` and setting `current_sum` to `x`.
   - **Iterative Process**: The function then iterates from 1 to `n-1`:
     - It checks if adding `y` to the current sum `current_sum` would keep it within bounds (`current_sum + y <= s`). If true, it appends `sequence[-1] + y` to the sequence and updates `current_sum` accordingly.
     - If adding `y` would exceed `s`, it appends `sequence[-1] % y` to the sequence and updates `current_sum` to the new sum.
     - It also checks if the current sum exceeds `s` at each step. If it does, it immediately returns `None`.
   - **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if the current sum equals `s`. If so, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads each test case and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns a sequence, it prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it prints "No".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Small `s` Compared to `n` and `y`**: The function correctly handles cases where `s` is very small by ensuring the sum does not exceed `s`.
   - **`y` Equal to 1**: When `y` is 1, the sequence alternates between `x` and `x % 1`, which simplifies to just `x` repeatedly.
   - **Current Sum Exceeds `s`**: The function avoids infinite loops by resetting the sequence and `current_sum` when the sum exceeds `s`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic ensures that the generated sequence meets the criteria for being modular.
   - The approach guarantees finding a sequence that sums to `s` if possible, using the allowed operations (`+y` or `%y`).
   - The implementation is robust and covers various edge cases.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Annotated State Before Function Call**:
  - The program initializes `t` (number of test cases), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s` and calls `func_1`.

- **Annotated State After Function Call**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly handles the sequence generation process and ensures the sum matches `s` if possible.
  - The annotations accurately describe the state of the program after each step of the function execution.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and edge cases handled by the function `func_1`. The program is designed to generate a modular sequence that sums to `s` if possible, and it handles various edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
