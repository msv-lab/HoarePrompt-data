### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function initializes a sequence with the first element `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n-1`, attempting to add `y` to the last element of the sequence if it doesn't exceed the target sum `s`. This is a greedy approach to maximize the contribution of `y` to the sum.
   - If adding `y` would exceed `s`, it instead appends the last element modulo `y`.
   - It checks after each addition if the current sum exceeds `s`. If it does, the function returns `None`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the current sum equals `s`. If so, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads each test case and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns a sequence, it prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it prints "No".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles cases where `s` is very small compared to `n` and `y`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `y` is 1, which simplifies the sequence generation.
   - The solution avoids infinite loops by checking if the current sum exceeds `s`.

However, upon closer inspection of the logic, we notice that the function `func_1` does not guarantee that the generated sequence will always be modular and meet the requirement of having the exact sum `s`.

### Analysis:

- **Issue with the Greedy Approach**: The current implementation of `func_1` uses a greedy approach to try to maximize the sum by adding `y` when possible. However, this approach does not ensure that the sequence remains modular and exactly meets the sum `s`.

- **Modular Constraint**: The problem requires the sequence to be modular, meaning each element should either be the previous element plus `y` or the previous element modulo `y`. The current implementation does not strictly enforce this constraint.

- **Sum Check**: The check `if current_sum + y <= s and (s - current_sum - y) % y == 0` is not sufficient to guarantee the modular property and the exact sum `s`. It only ensures that the sum does not exceed `s` and that the difference between `s` and the current sum minus `y` is divisible by `y`, but it does not enforce the modular property consistently.

- **Edge Cases**: The function fails to handle certain edge cases properly. For example, if `s` is very small compared to `n` and `y`, the greedy approach might not be able to form a valid sequence that meets both the modular property and the exact sum `s`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the implementation does not guarantee that the generated sequence will always be modular and meet the exact sum `s`. The function uses a greedy approach that does not strictly adhere to the modular constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
