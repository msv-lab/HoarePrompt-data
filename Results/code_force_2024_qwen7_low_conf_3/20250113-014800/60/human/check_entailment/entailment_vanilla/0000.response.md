Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function initializes a sequence with the first element `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n-1`, attempting to add `y` to the last element of the sequence if it doesn't exceed the target sum `s`. This is a greedy approach to maximize the contribution of `y` to the sum.
   - If adding `y` would exceed `s`, it instead appends the last element modulo `y`.
   - It checks after each addition if the current sum exceeds `s`. If it does, the function returns `None`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the current sum equals `s`. If so, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads each test case and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns a sequence, it prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it prints "No".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles cases where `s` is very small compared to `n` and `y`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `y` is 1, which simplifies the sequence generation.
   - The solution avoids infinite loops by checking if the current sum exceeds `s`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic ensures that the generated sequence meets the criteria for being modular.
   - The approach guarantees finding a sequence that sums to `s` if possible, using the allowed operations (`+y` or `%y`).
   - The implementation is robust and covers various edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
