Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate a modular sequence of length \( n \) starting with \( x \) where each subsequent element is either the previous element plus \( y \) or the previous element modulo \( y \). The sum of the sequence should equal \( s \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - Initializes the sequence with the first element `x`.
   - Iterates through the remaining \( n-1 \) elements.
   - Decides whether to add \( y \) or take the modulo \( y \) of the last element, ensuring the sum does not exceed \( s \).
   - Checks if the sum matches \( s \) at the end and returns the sequence if it does, otherwise returns `None`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n == 1`, the sequence is just `[x]` and we check if `x == s`.
   - If `current_sum` exceeds `s` at any point, the function returns `None`.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - The main loop in the script correctly calls `func_1` and prints the results based on its return value.
   - If the sequence is found, it prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.
   - If no sequence is found, it prints "No".

Given that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to generate a modular sequence and checks if the sum matches the required value, and the main loop correctly handles the output, the program is correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
