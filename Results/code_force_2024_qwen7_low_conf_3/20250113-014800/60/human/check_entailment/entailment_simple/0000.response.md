Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - It reads the values `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s` for each test case and passes them to the `func_1` function.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function initializes the sequence with the first element `x`.
   - It calculates the current sum of the sequence and checks if adding `y` to the last element or taking modulo `y` keeps the sum within the required limit `s`.
   - If adding `y` keeps the sum within `s`, it appends `sequence[-1] + y` to the sequence and updates the current sum.
   - Otherwise, it appends `sequence[-1] % y` to the sequence and updates the current sum.
   - If at any point the current sum exceeds `s`, it returns `None`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the current sum equals `s`. If so, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence construction ensures that each element is either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y`, adhering to the definition of a modular sequence.
   - The sequence is constructed to ensure the sum of its elements equals `s` or the sum exceeds `s` during the process, indicating that no valid sequence can be formed.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If a valid sequence is found, it prints "Yes" followed by the sequence elements.
   - If no valid sequence is found, it prints "No".

Given the logic and structure of the program, it correctly implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
