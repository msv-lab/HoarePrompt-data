Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to construct a valid sequence when the initial value `x` is greater than `y`. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 7 4 20`
- Expected Output: "Yes" followed by a valid sequence, such as `[7, 11, 3, 7]`.
- Actual Output: The program might output "No" because it does not properly account for the case where `x` is greater than `y`.

The issue arises in the `func_1` function. When `current_sum + y <= s` and `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0`, the program correctly appends `sequence[-1] + y` to the sequence. However, it does not handle the case where appending `sequence[-1] % y` does not lead to a valid sequence sum. This can happen when `x > y` and the sequence cannot be constructed to meet the sum requirement.

To fix this, the program needs to handle all possible sequences more comprehensively, ensuring that it can construct a valid sequence regardless of the values of `x` and `y`.
