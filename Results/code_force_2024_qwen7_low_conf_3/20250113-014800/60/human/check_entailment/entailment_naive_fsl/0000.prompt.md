You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers x and y . A sequence a of length n is called
modular if a_1=x , and for all 1 < i \le n the value of a_{i} is either
a_{i-1} + y or a_{i-1} \bmod y . Here x \bmod y denotes the remainder from
dividing x by y .

Determine if there exists a modular sequence of length n with the sum of its
elements equal to S , and if it exists, find any such sequence.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers n , x , y ,
and s (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le y \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le s \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the sequence, the
parameters x and y , and the required sum of the sequence elements.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 , and also the
sum of s over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, if the desired sequence exists, output "Yes" on the first
line (without quotes). Then, on the second line, output n integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_n separated by a space — the elements of the sequence a . If there
are multiple suitable sequences, output any of them.

If the sequence does not exist, output "No" on a single line.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5 8 3 28
    
    3 5 3 6
    
    9 1 5 79

Output

    YES
    8 11 2 2 5 
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the sequence [8, 11, 2, 5, 2] satisfies the conditions.
Thus, a_1 = 8 = x , a_2 = 11 = a_1 + 3 , a_3 = 2 = a_2 \bmod 3 , a_4 = 5 = a_3
+ 3 , a_5 = 2 = a_4 \bmod 3 .

In the second example, the first element of the sequence should be equal to 5
, so the sequence [2, 2, 2] is not suitable.
Program:
```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y, s) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, x, y, s)
    if result:
        print('Yes')
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(n, x, y, s):
    sequence = [x]
    current_sum = x
    for i in range(1, n):
        if current_sum + y <= s and (s - current_sum - y) % y == 0:
            sequence.append(sequence[-1] + y)
            current_sum += y
        else:
            sequence.append(sequence[-1] % y)
            current_sum += sequence[-1]
        if current_sum > s:
            return None
    if current_sum == s:
        return sequence
    else:
        return None


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
