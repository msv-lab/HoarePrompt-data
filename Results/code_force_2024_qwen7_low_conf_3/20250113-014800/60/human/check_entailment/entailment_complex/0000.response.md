Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes the sequence with the first element `x`.
   - It then iterates through the sequence generation process, deciding whether to add `y` to the last element or take the modulus of the last element with `y` to ensure the cumulative sum does not exceed `s`.
   - If at any point the cumulative sum (`current_sum`) exceeds `s`, the sequence is reset to `[x, x % y]` and `current_sum` is reset to `x + (x % y)`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the cumulative sum equals `s`. If it does, the function returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Output Handling**: Based on the return value of `func_1`, the program prints "Yes" followed by the sequence if the function returns a sequence, or "No" if the function returns `None`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `current_sum` might exceed `s` by resetting the sequence and `current_sum`.
   - The initial conditions and the constraints on `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s` are respected within the function.

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the sequence generated meets the criteria of being modular and having the required sum `s`.
   - The program's flow correctly follows the specifications provided in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for generating the modular sequence and determining its existence.

Correctness: **True**
