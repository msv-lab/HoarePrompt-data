`current_sum` is incremented by `y`. The previous value of `current_sum` was `x + y`, so after adding `y` to it, the new value of `current_sum` is `(x + y) + y`, which simplifies to `x + 2y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is `[x, x + y]`, `current_sum` is `x + 2y`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is `[x, x + y]`, `current_sum` is `x + 2y`**
