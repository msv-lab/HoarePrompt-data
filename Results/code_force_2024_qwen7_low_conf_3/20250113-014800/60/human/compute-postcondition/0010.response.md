Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is either `[x, x + y]` or `[x, x % y]`, depending on whether `current_sum + y <= s` and `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0` is true or false. `current_sum` is greater than `s`, and `sequence` is updated accordingly.**
