The code updates `current_sum` by adding the last element of the `sequence` list. Let's consider both possible states of `sequence`.

1. If `sequence` is `[x, x + y, 0]`, then `sequence[-1]` is `0`. Therefore, `current_sum` will be updated to `current_sum + 0`, which means `current_sum` remains unchanged.
2. If `sequence` is `[x, x % y, x % y]`, then `sequence[-1]` is `x % y`. Therefore, `current_sum` will be updated to `current_sum + (x % y)`.

Since the initial value of `current_sum` is either `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y)`, let's update these accordingly:

- If `current_sum` was initially `x + 2y` and `sequence` is `[x, x + y, 0]`, then `current_sum` remains `x + 2y`.
- If `current_sum` was initially `x + 2y` and `sequence` is `[x, x % y, x % y]`, then `current_sum` becomes `x + 2y + (x % y)`.
- If `current_sum` was initially `x + (x % y)` and `sequence` is `[x, x + y, 0]`, then `current_sum` remains `x + (x % y)`.
- If `current_sum` was initially `x + (x % y)` and `sequence` is `[x, x % y, x % y]`, then `current_sum` becomes `x + (x % y) + (x % y)`.

Thus, the updated `current_sum` depends on the initial value and the state of `sequence`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `current_sum` is either `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y) + (x % y)` depending on the initial value and the state of `sequence`, and `sequence` is either `[x, x + y, 0]` or `[x, x % y, x % y]`.**
