`current_sum` is incremented by `y`. The value of `y` can be derived from the sequence definition. Since `current_sum` was previously a non-negative integer, adding `y` to it will result in `current_sum` being a non-negative integer greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is either `[x, x + y, x + 3y]` or `[x, x % y, (x % y) + 2y]`, and `current_sum` is a non-negative integer greater than its previous value.**
