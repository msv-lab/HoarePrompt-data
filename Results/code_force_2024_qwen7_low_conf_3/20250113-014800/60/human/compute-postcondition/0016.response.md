The code appends the last element of `sequence` modulo `y` to `sequence`. Initially, `sequence` is either `[x, x + y]` or `[x, x % y]`. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `sequence` is `[x, x + y]`, appending `sequence[-1] % y` (which is `(x + y) % y = 0`) to `sequence` results in `[x, x + y, 0]`.
2. If `sequence` is `[x, x % y]`, appending `sequence[-1] % y` (which is `(x % y) % y = x % y`) to `sequence` results in `[x, x % y, x % y]`.

In both cases, the value of `y` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`n`, `x`, `s`, `current_sum`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `current_sum` is either `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y)`, and `sequence` is either `[x, x + y, 0]` or `[x, x % y, x % y]`.**
