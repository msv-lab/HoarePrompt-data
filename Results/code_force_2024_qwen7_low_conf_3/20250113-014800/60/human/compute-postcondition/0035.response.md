Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`, where `n` is a positive integer, and `x`, `y`, and `s` are non-negative integers with specific constraints. The function generates a sequence based on certain conditions and returns either the sequence or `None`.

1. The function initializes a list `sequence` with the first element `x`.
2. It iterates `n-1` times, appending new elements to `sequence` based on two conditions:
   - If adding `y` to the current sum `current_sum` does not exceed `s` and `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0`, the next element is `sequence[-1] + y`.
   - Otherwise, the next element is `sequence[-1] % y`.
3. After each iteration, it checks if `current_sum` exceeds `s`. If it does, the function returns `None`.
4. If the cumulative sum `current_sum` equals `s` after the loop, the function returns the generated sequence. If `current_sum` exceeds `s` during the loop, the sequence is reset to `[x, x % y]` and `current_sum` is reset to `x + (x % y)`, and the function returns `None`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n == 0`, the function will not enter the loop and will return `None` immediately.
- If `current_sum` exceeds `s` on the first iteration, the sequence will be reset to `[x, x % y]` and `current_sum` will be reset to `x + (x % y)`, and the function will return `None`.

Missing functionality:
- The annotations suggest that the code does something but the actual code does not include the necessary checks to handle the case where `current_sum` exceeds `s` on the first iteration. This should be included to ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.**

Functionality: **The function `func_1` generates a sequence based on specified conditions and returns either the sequence or `None`. The sequence starts with `x` and each subsequent element is either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y` depending on whether adding `y` to the current sum `current_sum` would exceed `s`. If `current_sum` equals `s`, the function returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`. Edge cases include handling `n == 0` and resetting the sequence and `current_sum` if `current_sum` exceeds `s` on the first iteration.**
