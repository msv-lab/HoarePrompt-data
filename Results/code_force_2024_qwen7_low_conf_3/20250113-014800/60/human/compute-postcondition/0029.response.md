Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is a list where the first element is `x`, and each subsequent element depends on the previous element and the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, each element in the sequence after the first one is either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y` based on whether adding `y` to `current_sum` would exceed `s` or not. `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence`. If at any point `current_sum` exceeds `s`, the sequence is reset to `[x, x % y]` and `current_sum` is reset to `x + (x % y)` if this condition occurs.**

This state describes the final configuration of the variables after the loop has completed its iterations, taking into account the conditions under which elements are added to the sequence and the behavior when `current_sum` exceeds `s`.
