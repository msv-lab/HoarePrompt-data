Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `y` is a non-negative integer.
   - `s` is a non-negative integer.
   - `sequence` is `[x]`.
   - `current_sum` is `x`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `n-1`. This means the loop will execute `n-1` times.

3. **Requirements for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `1` (since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`).
   - The initial values of `sequence` and `current_sum` are set correctly as per the given state.

### Modified States:

Given the loop condition and the initial state, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `1` for the loop to execute. All other states remain unchanged as they are already consistent with the loop requirements.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is `[x]`, `current_sum` is `x`**
