The code `sequence.append(sequence[-1] + y)` appends the value of the last element in the `sequence` list plus `y` to the end of the list. Given the initial conditions:

- `sequence` is either `[x, x + y]` or `[x, x % y]`.
- `current_sum` is either `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y)`.
- `current_sum + y <= s` or `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0` holds true.

Let's consider both cases for `sequence`:

### Case 1: `sequence` is `[x, x + y]`
- The last element of `sequence` is `x + y`.
- After appending `sequence[-1] + y`, the new element will be `(x + y) + y = x + 2y`.

So, `sequence` becomes `[x, x + y, x + 2y]`.

### Case 2: `sequence` is `[x, x % y]`
- The last element of `sequence` is `x % y`.
- After appending `sequence[-1] + y`, the new element will be `(x % y) + y`. Since `x % y` is a non-negative integer less than `y`, adding `y` to it results in a value between `y` and `2y - 1` (inclusive).

So, `sequence` becomes `[x, x % y, (x % y) + y]`.

In both cases, the updated `sequence` list includes the new element. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is either `[x, x + y, x + 2y]` or `[x, x % y, (x % y) + y]`, `current_sum` is either `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y)`, and `current_sum + y <= s` or `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0` holds true.**
