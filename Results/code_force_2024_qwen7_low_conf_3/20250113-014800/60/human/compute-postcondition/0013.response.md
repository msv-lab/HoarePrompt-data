According to the given for loop statement `for i in range(1, n):`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `y` is a non-negative integer.
- `s` is a non-negative integer.
- `sequence` is either `[x, x + y]` or `[x, x % y]`.
- `current_sum` is either `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y)`.
- `current_sum + y <= s` or `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0` holds true.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the condition `i < n` must hold true.

Given that `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will now be `2`. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `s`, `sequence`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the problem statement indicates no modifications within the loop body, these values stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is either `[x, x + y]` or `[x, x % y]`, `current_sum` is either `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y)`, and `current_sum + y <= s` or `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0` holds true.**
