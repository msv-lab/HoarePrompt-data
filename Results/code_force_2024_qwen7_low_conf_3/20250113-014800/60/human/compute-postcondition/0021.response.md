According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is the current value within the range starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Let's analyze the state step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is the current value (let's call it `i_current`).
   - `i_current < n` (since the loop just finished).

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - So, the new value of `i` will be `i_current + 1`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue if `(i_current + 1) < n`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1, and `n` still must be greater than 2.

**State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, and `sequence` is either `[x, x + y, x + 2y]` or `[x, x % y, (x % y) + y]`. If `current_sum > s`, then `sequence` is updated to `[x, x + y, 0]` or `[x, x % y, x % y]`. Otherwise, `current_sum` is updated to `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y) + y`.**
