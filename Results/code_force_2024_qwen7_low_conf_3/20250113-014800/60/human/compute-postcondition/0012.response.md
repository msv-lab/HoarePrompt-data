Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is either `[x, x + y]` or `[x, x % y]`, `current_sum` is either `x + 2y` or `x + (x % y)`, and `current_sum + y <= s` or `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0` holds true.***
