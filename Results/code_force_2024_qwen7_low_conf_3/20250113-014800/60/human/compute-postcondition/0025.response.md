`current_sum` is updated by adding the last element of the `sequence`. The last element of `sequence` is either `(x + 2y) % y` or `((x % y) + y) % y`. Since the exact value of `x` and `y` is not specified, we cannot simplify the expression further. However, the initial conditions are maintained.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is either `[x, x + y, x + 2y, (x + 2y) % y]` or `[x, x % y, (x % y) + y, ((x % y) + y) % y]`, `current_sum` is updated by adding the last element of `sequence`**
