The code appends the last element of the `sequence` list plus `y` to the `sequence` list. The last element of `sequence` is `x`, so the new element added to the list is `x + y`. The other variables are not affected.

Given the precondition:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `x` is a non-negative integer
- `y` is a non-negative integer
- `s` is a non-negative integer
- `sequence` is `[x]`
- `current_sum` is `x`
- `current_sum + y <= s`
- `s - current_sum - y % y == 0`

After executing the code, the `sequence` list becomes `[x, x + y]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is `[x, x + y]`, `current_sum` is `x + y`.**
