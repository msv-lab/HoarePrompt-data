The code initializes the variable `current_sum` with the value of `x`. The values of `n`, `y`, `s`, and `sequence` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is `[x]`, `current_sum` is `x`.**
