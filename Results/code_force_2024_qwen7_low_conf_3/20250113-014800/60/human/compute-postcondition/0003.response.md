Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is `[x]`, `current_sum` is `x`. The current sum (`current_sum`) plus `y` is less than or equal to `s` and the difference between `s` and the current sum (`current_sum`) minus `y` is divisible by `y`.***
