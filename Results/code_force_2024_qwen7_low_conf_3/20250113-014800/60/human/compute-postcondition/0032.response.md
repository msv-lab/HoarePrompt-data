Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is a list where the first element is `x`, and each subsequent element is either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y` based on whether adding `y` to `current_sum` would exceed `s` or not. `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence`. If at any point `current_sum` exceeds `s`, the sequence is reset to `[x, x % y]` and `current_sum` is reset to `x + (x % y)`. The condition `current_sum` is not equal to `s`.
