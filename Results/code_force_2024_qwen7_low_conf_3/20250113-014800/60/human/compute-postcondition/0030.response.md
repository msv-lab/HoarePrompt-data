Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is a list where the first element is `x`, and each subsequent element depends on the previous element and the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, each element in the sequence after the first one is either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y` based on whether adding `y` to `current_sum` would exceed `s` or not. `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence`. If at any point `current_sum` exceeds `s`, the sequence is reset to `[x, x % y]` and `current_sum` is reset to `x + (x % y). The current value of `current_sum` is equal to `s`**.
