The function `func_2` accepts a list `arr` of strings representing integers. It first checks if the last character of the first string in `arr` is '0'. If it is, a variable `found` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`. Then, it iterates through the rest of the strings in `arr` to find another string ending in '0' with the highest value according to `func_1`. If such a string is found, `idx` is updated to its index and `found` is set to `True`. After the loop, if `found` is `True`, the string at index `idx` is reversed and ensures it ends with '0'. The function returns the modified list `arr`. This function handles the case where `arr` contains at least two elements and ensures that if `found` is `True`, the string at `idx` is reversed and ends with '0', while `func_1(arr[idx])` may change. The function does not handle cases where `arr` might be empty or contain fewer than two elements, which would result in undefined behavior.
