arr is a list of strings representing integers where each string consists only of digits (0-9) and each string length is at most 10^9 (considering the constraints, this is practically limited by the string representation in memory), and the function `func_1` is a hypothetical helper function that evaluates some property of the string (such as its numeric value) which is not defined here.
