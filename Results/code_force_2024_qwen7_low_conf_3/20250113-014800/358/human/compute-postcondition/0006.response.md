The code `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the pre-existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of strings containing the split input values, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0.**
