The code updates the value of `zrr[i]` to `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`. Since `i` is 1, this affects `zrr[1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `len_arr[0]` is the length of `a[0]`
- `len_arr[1]` is the length of `a[1]`
- `len_arr[j]` is 0 for `j != 0`
- `zrr` is a list where `zrr[0]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[0]`, `zrr[1]` is initially 0 (since `len_arr[1]` is 0), and `zrr[0]` is `len_arr[0] - zrr[0]`
- `ans` is `len_arr[0] - zrr[0]`
- `a` is a list of strings created from the input

The code changes `zrr[1]` to `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`.

So, the updated value of `zrr[1]` will be `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `len_arr[0]` is the length of `a[0]`, `len_arr[1]` is the length of `a[1]`, `len_arr[j]` is 0 for `j != 0`, `zrr` is a list where `zrr[0]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[0]`, `zrr[1]` is `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`, and `ans` is `len_arr[0] - zrr[0]`.**
