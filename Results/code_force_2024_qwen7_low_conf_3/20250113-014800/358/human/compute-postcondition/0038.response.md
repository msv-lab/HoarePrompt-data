`n` and `m` are assigned the values from `map(int, input().split())`. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all even indices `i` plus the sum of `zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i`. After the input, `n` and `m` are defined.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all even indices `i` plus the sum of `zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i`.**
