The code updates `ans` by adding the value of `zrr[i]`. Here, `i` is `n`, and the values of `zrr[n]` and `n` are as described in the initial state. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `zrr[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `len_arr[n]` is the length of `a[n]`, `zrr[n]` is `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is updated based on the condition `(n+1) % 2 != 0` and `ans` is now `ans + zrr[n]`**
