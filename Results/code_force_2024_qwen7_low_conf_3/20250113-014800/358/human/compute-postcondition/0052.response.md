In the given code snippet, `len_arr[i]` is assigned the value of `len(a[i])`. This means that `len_arr[i]` will now hold the length of the list element `a[i]`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Previous State:**
   - `len_arr[i]` was previously assigned a value from a previous computation or initialization.
   - `a[i]` is a list element.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `len_arr[i]` is reassigned to the length of `a[i]`.

3. **New State:**
   - `len_arr[i]` now holds the length of `a[i]`.

Since the code does not affect any other variables, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`**.
