The code `print('Anna')` does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints 'Anna' to the console. Since no variables are assigned new values, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[j] - zrr[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1` where `ans` is updated only when `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`), `n` is unchanged, `len_arr` is unchanged, `zrr` is unchanged, and `a` is unchanged, and `ans - 1 < m`. Printed output is 'Anna'**
