`ans` is incremented by the value of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`. The value of `len_arr[i]` is known, but the exact value of `zrr[i]` is dependent on `a[i]`. However, `zrr[i]` is defined as `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, which means it calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string `a[i]`.

The impact on `ans` is clear, but the values of `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is also unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`**
