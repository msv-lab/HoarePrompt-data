The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`. From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `len_arr[i+1]` is the length of `a[i+1]`
- `zrr[i+1]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[i+1]`
- `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`

The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` adds the value of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` to `ans`.

So, the updated state for `ans` is that it is now equal to its previous value plus `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `len_arr[i+1]` is the length of `a[i+1]`; `zrr[i+1]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[i+1]`; `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`**
