Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, starting from 0. If `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`), then `i` remains 1, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `zrr[1]`, and `n`, `len_arr`, `zrr`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `i` is even, then `i` remains 0, and `ans`, `n`, `len_arr`, `zrr`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
