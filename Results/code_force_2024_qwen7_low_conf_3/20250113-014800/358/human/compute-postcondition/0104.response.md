Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[j] - zrr[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1` where `ans` is updated only when `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`), `n` is unchanged, `len_arr` is unchanged, `zrr` is unchanged, and `a` is unchanged, and the current value of `ans` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`**
