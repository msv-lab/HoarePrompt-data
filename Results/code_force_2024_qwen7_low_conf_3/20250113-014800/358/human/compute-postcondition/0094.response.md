Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `len_arr` is a list of integers, `zrr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[j] - zrr[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, and `a` is a list of strings created from the input. The current value of `i` is odd**
