The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]` to the current value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`
- `zrr[i]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[i]`

After executing the code, the updated state is as follows:

- `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`
- The values of `n`, `len_arr[i]`, and `zrr[i]` remain the same

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is greater than 0; `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`; `zrr[i]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[i]`; `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`**
