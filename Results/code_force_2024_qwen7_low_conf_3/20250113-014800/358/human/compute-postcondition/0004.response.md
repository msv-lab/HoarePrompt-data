The code initializes a list `len_arr` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The length of this list is determined by the value of `n`, which is an integer input. The other variables (`t`, `m`, and `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros**
