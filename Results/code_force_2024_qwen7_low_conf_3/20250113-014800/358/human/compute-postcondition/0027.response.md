Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` sorted in descending order for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is the updated sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `i+1` is odd (i.e., `(i+1) % 2 != 0`), `ans` is incremented by `zrr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
