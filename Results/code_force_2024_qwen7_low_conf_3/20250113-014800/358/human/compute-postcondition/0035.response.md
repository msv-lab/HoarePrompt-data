The code `print('Anna')` simply prints the string 'Anna' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the output of the string 'Anna'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all even indices `i` plus the sum of `zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i`. The value of `ans - 1` is less than `m`; the string 'Anna' is printed to the console.**
