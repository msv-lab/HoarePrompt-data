Postcondition: **`i` is `last_i + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `len_arr` is a list of the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in the strings in `a` sorted in descending order. If `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`), `ans` is updated to `ans + zrr[i]`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
