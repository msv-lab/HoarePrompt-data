Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `len_arr` is a list of the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in the strings in `a` sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. The value of `ans` satisfies the condition `ans - 1 >= m`.**
