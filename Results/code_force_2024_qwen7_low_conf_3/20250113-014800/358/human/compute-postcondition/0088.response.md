The code assigns the length of the list `a` at index `i` to `len_arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer greater than 2, the value of `i` does not change, and the value of `n` remains as an input integer greater than 2. However, the value of `len_arr[2]` is now set to the length of the list `a[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `len_arr[2]` is the length of `a[2]`**
