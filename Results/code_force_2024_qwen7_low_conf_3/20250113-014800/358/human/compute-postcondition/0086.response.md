The code snippet `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` to the current value of `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and the indices of `len_arr` and `zrr` that are non-zero correspond to `len_arr[0]` and `zrr[0]`.

- For `i = 1`, `len_arr[1]` is 0, and `zrr[1]` is `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`. So, `len_arr[1] - zrr[1]` simplifies to `0 - (len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0')))`, which is `-len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`.

Therefore, `ans` is updated by subtracting the number of trailing zeros in `a[1]` from its current value.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `len_arr[0]` is the length of `a[0]`, `len_arr[1]` is 0, `zrr[0]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[0]`, `zrr[1]` is `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` minus the number of trailing zeros in `a[1]`.**
