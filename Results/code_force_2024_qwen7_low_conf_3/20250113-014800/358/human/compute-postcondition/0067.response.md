Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `len_arr` is a list of the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in the strings in `a` sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. For each iteration, if `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`), the value of `zrr[i]` is added to `ans`.

2. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
   - The condition `i % 2 != 0` ensures that only the elements at odd indices in `zrr` contribute to the final value of `ans`.
   - Therefore, `ans` is the sum of `zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.

This ensures that `ans` captures the desired sum based on the specified condition within the loop.
