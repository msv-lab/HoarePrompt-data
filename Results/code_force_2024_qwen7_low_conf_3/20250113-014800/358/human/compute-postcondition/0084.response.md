The code snippet updates `len_arr[i]` to be the length of `a[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `len_arr[0]` is the length of `a[0]`
- `len_arr[j]` is 0 for `j != 0`
- `zrr` is a list where `zrr[0]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[0]`
- `ans` is `len_arr[0] - zrr[0]`
- `a` is a list of strings created from the input

Since `i` is 1, the code snippet `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])` will update `len_arr[1]` to be the length of `a[1]`.

The output state will reflect this change:
- `len_arr[1]` is now the length of `a[1]`
- All other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `len_arr[0]` is the length of `a[0]`, `len_arr[1]` is the length of `a[1]`, `len_arr[j]` is 0 for `j != 0`, `zrr` is a list where `zrr[0]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[0]`, `ans` is `len_arr[0] - zrr[0]`, and `a` is a list of strings created from the input.**
