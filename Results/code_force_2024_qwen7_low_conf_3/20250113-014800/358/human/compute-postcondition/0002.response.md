`n, m` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which converts the input into integers. The value of `t` is not affected by this code, so the output state is: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input.
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input**
