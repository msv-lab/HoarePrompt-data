Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is a positive integer (\( n > 0 \)).
- \( \text{len\_arr}[i] \) is the length of \( a[i] \).
- \( \text{zrr}[i] \) is \( \text{len}(a[i]) - \text{len}(a[i].rstrip('0')) \) sorted in descending order for all \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- \( \text{ans} \) is the sum of \( \text{len\_arr}[i] - \text{zrr}[i] \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        ans += zrr[i]
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over each index \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \). For each iteration, if \( i \) is odd (i.e., \( i \% 2 \neq 0 \)), the value of \( \text{zrr}[i] \) is added to \( \text{ans} \).

### Key Observations:
1. The loop will execute exactly \( n \) times because it iterates over each index from 0 to \( n-1 \).
2. Only the odd indices contribute to the update of \( \text{ans} \).

### Final Output State:
After the loop finishes executing, the value of \( \text{ans} \) will be the sum of \( \text{len\_arr}[i] - \text{zrr}[i] \) for all even indices \( i \) plus the sum of \( \text{zrr}[i] \) for all odd indices \( i \).

Thus, the final state of the variables will be:

- \( \text{len\_arr}[i] \) is the length of \( a[i] \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- \( \text{zrr}[i] \) is \( \text{len}(a[i]) - \text{len}(a[i].rstrip('0')) \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \), sorted in descending order.
- \( \text{ans} \) is the sum of \( \text{len\_arr}[i] - \text{zrr}[i] \) for all even indices \( i \) plus the sum of \( \text{zrr}[i] \) for all odd indices \( i \).

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all even indices `i` plus the sum of `zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i`.**
