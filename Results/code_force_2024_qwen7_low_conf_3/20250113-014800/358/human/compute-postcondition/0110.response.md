The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to work with variables `n`, `m`, and a list of integers `a`. These variables are constrained as follows: `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `m` is an integer where \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). Additionally, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The output of the function depends on the values of `n`, `m`, and the list `a`. However, since the specific logic for generating the output is not provided, we can only describe the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but works with variables `n`, `m`, and a list `a` of length `n`. `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `m` is an integer where \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).**
