The code assigns the length of the string `a[i]` to `len_arr[i]`. This affects the value of `len_arr[i]` but does not change the values of `n`, `zrr[n]`, or `ans`. Therefore, the length of `a[i]` is stored in `len_arr[i]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `zrr[n]` is `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n]`, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`**
