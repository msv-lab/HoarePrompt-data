Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `zrr[2]`, `n` is unchanged, `len_arr` is unchanged, `zrr` is unchanged, and `a` is unchanged. This holds true regardless of whether `i % 2 != 0` is true or false since there is no else part provided and the if part always updates `ans` accordingly.***
