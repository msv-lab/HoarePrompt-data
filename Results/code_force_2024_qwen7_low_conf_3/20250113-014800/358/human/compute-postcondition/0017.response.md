The code snippet updates `zrr[i]` to the value of `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`. Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 0, `zrr[n]` is updated to `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n] + (len_arr[i] - zrr[i])`, `len_arr[1]` is the length of `a[1]`, and `i` is 1, we need to focus on updating `zrr[i]`.

- Initially, `zrr[n]` is set to `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))`.
- After the code executes, `zrr[i]` (where `i` is 1) is updated to `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`.

The other variables (`n`, `ans`, `len_arr`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this line of code, except for `i` which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `zrr[1]` is updated to `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n] + (len_arr[i] - zrr[i])`, `len_arr[1]` is the length of `a[1]`, and `i` is 1**
