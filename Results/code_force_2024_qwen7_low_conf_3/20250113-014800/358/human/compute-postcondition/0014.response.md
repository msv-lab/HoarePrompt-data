The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`. Given that `zrr[n]` was previously updated to `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))` and `ans` was increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n]`, we know that `zrr[i]` and `len_arr[i]` have specific values related to `a[i]`.

Let's denote the specific values as follows:
- `zrr[i]` is the value of `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` for the current `i`.
- `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`.

The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` simply adds the difference between the length of `a[i]` and `zrr[i]` to `ans`.

Since the exact values of `a[i]` are not provided, we express the updated value of `ans` in terms of these known quantities.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `zrr[n]` is updated to `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n] + (len_arr[i] - zrr[i])`, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`.**
