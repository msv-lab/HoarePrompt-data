Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of integers in each test case, `m` is an integer for each test case, `a` is a list of strings containing integers, `len_arr` is a list of the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in the strings in `a` sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all even indices `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` plus the sum of `zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. After processing all test cases, if `ans - 1` is greater than or equal to the maximum `m` among all test cases, the final output is 'Sasha'. Otherwise, the final output is 'Anna'.**
