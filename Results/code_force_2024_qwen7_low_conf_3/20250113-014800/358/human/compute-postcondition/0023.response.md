The code snippet `ans += zrr[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `zrr[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `ans` is updated to be the original `ans` plus `zrr[1]`.

The initial state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`
- `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` sorted in descending order for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- `i` is 1 since `i % 2 != 0`

After the code executes, the value of `ans` changes to `ans + zrr[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` sorted in descending order for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` plus `zrr[1]`, `i` is 1**
