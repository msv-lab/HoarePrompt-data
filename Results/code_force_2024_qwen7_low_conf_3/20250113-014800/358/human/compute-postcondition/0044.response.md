The code `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])` assigns the length of the list `a[i]` to the element `len_arr[i]`. However, there are no definitions or initial values given for `len_arr` or `a`, and `i` is not defined in the provided context. Since these are undefined, we cannot determine the exact values, but we know that `len_arr[i]` will be updated with the length of `a[i]`.

Given the initial state that `n` must be greater than 0, this condition remains unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `len_arr[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`**
