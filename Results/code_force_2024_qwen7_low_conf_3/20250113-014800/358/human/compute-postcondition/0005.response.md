The code initializes a list `zrr` with `n` zeros. The values of the other variables (`t`, `m`, `a`, and `len_arr`) are not affected by this operation.

- `zrr` is now a list of `n` zeros.
- The values of `t`, `m`, `a`, and `len_arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of strings containing the split input values, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros.**
