Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, `len_arr` is a list of the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in the strings in `a` sorted in descending order. If `i` is odd, `ans` is updated by adding `zrr[i]` to its original value. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
