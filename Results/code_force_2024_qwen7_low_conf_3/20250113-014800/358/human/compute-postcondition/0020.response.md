The code `zrr.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `zrr` in descending order. This operation changes the order of elements in `zrr` but does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
