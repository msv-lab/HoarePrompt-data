`ans` is incremented by the value of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`. The value of `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`, and `zrr[i]` is `len_arr[i] - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`. Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding the difference between the length of `a[i]` and the difference between the length of `a[i]` and the length of `a[i]` stripped of trailing zeros.

Output State: **`len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`; `zrr[i]` is `len_arr[i] - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`; `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`**
