The code `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the value of `ans` is updated to 0, while the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `zrr`, and `len_arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of strings created from the input, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros**
