Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Control Variable and Conditions**: The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

2. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `t` is an integer input from the user.
   - Each test case consists of `n` and `m`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - There is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Inside each iteration of the loop, `n` and `m` will be read for each test case, and a list of `n` integers will be processed.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - Since `t` is the control variable for the outer loop, we need to ensure `t` is at least 1.
   - No other variables need adjustment for the loop to start executing based on the given information.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
