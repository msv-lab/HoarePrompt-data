The code assigns the value of `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` to `zrr[i]`. This operation removes trailing zeros from the string `a[i]` and then calculates the difference in lengths between the original string and the string without trailing zeros.

Let's denote the length of `a[i]` as `len_arr[i]`. The `rstrip('0')` method removes all trailing zeros from `a[i]`, and the resulting length is subtracted from `len_arr[i]`.

So, the new value of `zrr[i]` is `len_arr[i] - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`.

Output State: **`len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`; `zrr[i]` is `len_arr[i] - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`**
