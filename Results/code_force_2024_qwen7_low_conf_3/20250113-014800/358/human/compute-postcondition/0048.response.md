The code `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])` updates the value of `len_arr[i]` to the length of the list `a[i]`. The previous state was that `len_arr[i+1]` is the length of `a[i+1]`, and now `len_arr[i]` will be the length of `a[i]`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `len_arr[i+1]` is the length of `a[i+1]`; `zrr[i+1]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[i+1]`; `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`**
