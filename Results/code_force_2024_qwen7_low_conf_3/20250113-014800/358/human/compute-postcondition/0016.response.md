The code updates `len_arr[i]` to the length of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `len_arr[1]` is updated to the length of `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `zrr[n]` is updated to `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n] + (len_arr[i] - zrr[i])`, `len_arr[1]` is the length of `a[1]`, and `i` is 1**
