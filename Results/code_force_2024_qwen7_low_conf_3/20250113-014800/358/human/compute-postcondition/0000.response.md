`t` is a positive integer, and each test case consists of `n` and `m` where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial value of `t` is a positive integer, the new value of `t` will be the integer input from the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user, each test case consists of `n` and `m` where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).**
