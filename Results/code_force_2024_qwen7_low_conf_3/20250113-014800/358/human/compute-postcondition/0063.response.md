Postcondition: ***`i` is `last_i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `len_arr` is a list of the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in the strings in `a` sorted in descending order, and if `last_i` is even, `ans` is updated to `ans + zrr[i]`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
