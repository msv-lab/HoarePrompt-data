`zrr` is sorted in descending order, which means the elements in `zrr` are rearranged from the largest to the smallest. The values of `n`, `len_arr`, `ans`, and the original order of elements in `zrr` are not directly affected by this sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `len_arr` is a list of the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in the strings in `a` sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.**
