Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all even indices `i` plus the sum of `zrr[i]` for all odd indices `i`. `ans` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`***
