The code updates the value of `zrr[i]` to be `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the code snippet, it is assumed to be a loop variable iterating over a range that includes `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `zrr[n]` is `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))`
- `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n]`
- `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`

After the code execution:
- The value of `zrr[i]` for the current `i` is updated to `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`
- The value of `ans` remains the same as it was not directly affected by this line of code.

Since `i` is a loop variable and it's not specified which `i` it refers to, we assume it is updating `zrr[n]` based on the given snippet. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `zrr[n]` is updated to `len(a[n]) - len(a[n].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n]`, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`**
