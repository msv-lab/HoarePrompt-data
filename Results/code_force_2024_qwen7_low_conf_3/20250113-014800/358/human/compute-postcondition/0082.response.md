`ans` is incremented by the value of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `len_arr[0]` is the length of `a[0]`, and `zrr[0]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[0]`, the value of `ans` is updated to the value of `len_arr[0] - zrr[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `len_arr[0]` is the length of `a[0]`, `len_arr[j]` is 0 for `j != 0`, `zrr` is a list where `zrr[0]` is the number of trailing zeros in `a[0]`, `ans` is `len_arr[0] - zrr[0]`, and `a` is a list of strings created from the input.**
