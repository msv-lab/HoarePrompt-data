The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, we know `ans` is increased by `len_arr[1] - zrr[1]`.

From the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `zrr[1]` is updated to `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`
- `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n] - zrr[n] + (len_arr[i] - zrr[i])`, which simplifies to `len_arr[1] - zrr[1]` since `n` and `i` are both 1
- `len_arr[1]` is the length of `a[1]`
- `i` is 1

After executing the code, the value of `ans` is updated, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `zrr[1]` is updated to `len(a[1]) - len(a[1].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[1] - zrr[1]`, `len_arr[1]` is the length of `a[1]`, and `i` is 1**
