The code `a = list(map(str, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each string into a list of strings. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers from the input, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, these conditions are not directly impacted by the code. The new list `a` will contain the split input values as strings.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `m` is an integer from the input

After executing the code, the list `a` will contain the split input values as strings, and `n` and `m` will remain as integers from the input. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of strings containing the split input values**
