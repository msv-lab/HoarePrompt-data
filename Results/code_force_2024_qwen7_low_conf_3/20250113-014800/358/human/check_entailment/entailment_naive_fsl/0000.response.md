Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic described. Specifically, the program does not simulate the actual game process where Anna and Sasha take turns modifying the list according to the rules. Instead, it calculates some values based on the lengths of the numbers and their trailing zeros but does not actually simulate the game moves.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2 2
14 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Sasha
```

However, the provided program does not simulate the game process. It calculates the lengths of the numbers and their trailing zeros but does not simulate the actual turns of Anna and Sasha. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

The program should simulate the game process where Anna reverses the digits of an element, and Sasha concatenates two elements, until the game ends. The current implementation does not do this, hence it is incorrect.
