Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of the game based on the optimal play of both players.
2. The given solution calculates the total number of non-zero digits in the numbers after ignoring trailing zeros.
3. This total is compared with `m - 1`. If this total is greater than or equal to `m - 1`, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
4. The logic in the code correctly implements the strategy for determining the winner:
   - `len_arr[i]` stores the length of the string representation of each number.
   - `zrr[i]` stores the length of the string after removing trailing zeros.
   - The total number of non-zero digits (`ans`) is calculated.
   - The total is sorted in descending order (`zrr.sort(reverse=True)`).
   - The code then iterates through the sorted array, adding every odd-indexed element to `ans` (as Anna's moves are represented by odd indices in the sorted order), effectively simulating Anna's moves.
   - Finally, the comparison `ans - 1 >= m` correctly determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play of both players.

Correctness: **True**
