The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of strings representing integers in the range [1, 10^9]. It processes this list to find the string ending in '0' with the highest value returned by `func_1`, and modifies the list based on specific conditions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the final state of the program after the function concludes:

1. The function first identifies the index `idx1` of the string ending in '0' with the highest value returned by `func_1(arr[i])` in the list `arr`.
2. Next, it finds the index `idx2` of another string ending in '0' with the second-highest value returned by `func_1(arr[i])` in the list `arr`.
3. If `idx2` is not 0, the function concatenates the strings at indices `idx1` and `idx2` in `arr` and removes the string at index `idx2`.
4. If `idx2` is 0 and `foundOne` is True, the function concatenates the strings at indices `idx1` and `idx2` (which does not exist in this case), resulting in `arr[idx1]` being the only string ending in '0'.
5. If neither of the above conditions is met, the function concatenates the first two elements in the list and removes the second element.

In all cases, the function ensures that the list `arr` contains the appropriate modifications and index updates, with the value of `idx2` being either the index of the string with the second-highest value returned by `func_1` or invalid if no such string exists. The function returns the modified list `arr`.

The function handles all edge cases, including when no string in the list ends in '0', and ensures that the list is processed correctly according to the specified conditions.
