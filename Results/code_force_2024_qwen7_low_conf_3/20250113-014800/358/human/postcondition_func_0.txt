The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n`, an integer `m`, and a list of `n` space-separated strings representing integers. It calculates the total number of non-zero digits in these strings (ignoring trailing zeros) and compares this value with `m`. If the calculated value minus one is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function handles up to 200,000 test cases, with each test case containing between 1 and 200,000 integers and a list of strings representing those integers. Each string in the list can have up to 1 billion characters.
