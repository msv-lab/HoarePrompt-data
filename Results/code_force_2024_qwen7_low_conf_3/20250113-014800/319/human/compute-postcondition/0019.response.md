The code `last = f_a` assigns the current value of `f_a` to the variable `last`. This does not affect the values of other variables such as `i`, `q`, `v`, `a`, `f_a`, and `results`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is at least 1, `v` is (`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n, `a` is `[(`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n]`, `f_a` is `new_f_a`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains `[f_a]`**
