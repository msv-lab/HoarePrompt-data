According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `q` is at least 1
- `v` is \((\text{encrypted\_values}[1] + \text{last}) \% n\)
- `a` contains \([\text{v}]\)
- `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`
- `last` is equal to `f_a`
- `results` contains \([\text{f\_a}]\)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `q`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute again if `i` becomes 2. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
- `i` is 2
- `q` remains at least 1
- `v` remains \((\text{encrypted\_values}[1] + \text{last}) \% n\)
- `a` remains \([\text{v}]\)
- `f_a` remains the return value of `func_2(a)`
- `last` remains equal to `f_a`
- `results` remains containing \([\text{f\_a}]\)

State: **`i` is 2, `q` is at least 1, `v` is \((\text{encrypted\_values}[1] + \text{last}) \% n\), `a` contains \([\text{v}]\), `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains \([\text{f\_a}]\)**
