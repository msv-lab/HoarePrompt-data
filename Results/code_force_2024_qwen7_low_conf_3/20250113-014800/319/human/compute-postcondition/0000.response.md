The code `max_val = max(b)` calculates the maximum value in the list `b` and assigns it to the variable `max_val`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a list of non-negative integers; `max_val` is the maximum value in `b`.

Output State: **`b` is a list of non-negative integers; `max_val` is the maximum value in `b`**
