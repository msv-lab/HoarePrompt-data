The code appends the value of `f_a` to the list `results`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `i` is 1, `q` is at least 1, `v` is `(encrypted_values[1] + last) % n`, `a` contains `[v]`, `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, and `last` is equal to `f_a`.

Since the code only appends `f_a` to `results` and does not modify any of the existing variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is at least 1, `v` is `(encrypted_values[1] + last) % n`, `a` contains `[v]`, `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains `[f_a]`**.
