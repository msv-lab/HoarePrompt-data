Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers such that \(0 \leq e_i < n\) for each \(e_i\) in `encrypted_values`.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `last` is 0.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{22}\).
- `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 10^6\).
- `results` is an empty list.

### Loop Code
```
for i in range(q):
    v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
    a.append(v)
    f_a = func_2(a)
    last = f_a
    results.append(f_a)
```

### Iteration Analysis
- The loop runs `q` times.
- In each iteration `i`, `v` is computed as \((encrypted_values[i] + last) \% n\).
- `a` is updated by appending `v` to it.
- `f_a` is the result of `func_2(a)`.
- `last` is updated to `f_a`.
- `results` is updated by appending `f_a`.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes all `q` iterations:
- `i` will be `q - 1`.
- `v` will be \((encrypted_values[q-1] + last) \% n\).
- `a` will be a list containing all `v` values generated in each iteration.
- `f_a` will be the result of `func_2(a)`, which is the final value of `last` after the loop.
- `last` will be equal to `f_a`.
- `results` will contain `q` elements, each being `f_a`.

Thus, the final output state is:
**`i` is `q - 1`, `v` is \((encrypted_values[q-1] + last) \% n\), `a` is a list containing all `v` values generated in each iteration, `f_a` is `func_2(a)`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains `q` elements, each being `f_a`**.

Output State: **`i` is `q - 1`, `v` is \((encrypted_values[q-1] + last) \% n\), `a` is a list containing all `v` values generated in each iteration, `f_a` is `func_2(a)`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains `q` elements, each being `f_a`**.
