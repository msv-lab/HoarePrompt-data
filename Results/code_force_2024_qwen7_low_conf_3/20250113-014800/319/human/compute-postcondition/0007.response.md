The code sets `last` to the value of `f_a`. Since `f_a` is the result of `func_2(a)`, and `a` is a list containing `[v]`, the value of `f_a` is determined by `func_2([v])`. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we can only express `f_a` in terms of `v`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `q` must be at least 1
- `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`
- `a` is a list containing `[v]`
- `f_a` is the result of `func_2(a)`

After executing the line `last = f_a`, the value of `last` changes to `f_a`, which is `func_2([v])`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `q` must be at least 1; `v` is (encrypted_values[0] + last) % n; `a` is a list containing [v]; `last` is func_2([v])**
