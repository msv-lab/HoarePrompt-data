The code assigns the result of `func_2(a)` to `f_a`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined, and its exact behavior is unknown. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `f_a`, which gets the return value from `func_2(a)`. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `v`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be at least 1, `v` is `(encrypted_values[1] + last) % n`, `a` contains `[v]`, `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`**
