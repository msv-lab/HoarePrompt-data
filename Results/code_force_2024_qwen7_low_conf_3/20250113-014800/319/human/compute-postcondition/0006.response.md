The code `f_a = func_2(a)` assigns the result of calling `func_2` with `a` as the argument to `f_a`. However, the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `f_a`. We only know that `a` remains unchanged as a list containing `[v]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `q` must be at least 1; `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`; `a` is a list containing `[v]`; `f_a` is the result of `func_2(a)`**
