Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list `b` of non-negative integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list `b` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle the case where the list contains negative numbers, although the initial annotation mentions non-negative integers.**

Explanation:
- The function first determines the maximum (`max_val`) and minimum (`min_val`) values in the list `b`.
- It then calculates the difference between these two values.
- If the list `b` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because calling `max()` or `min()` on an empty list results in such an error.
- The function does not check for negative numbers in the list, even though the initial annotation specifies that `b` should contain non-negative integers. Therefore, if the list contains negative numbers, the function will still calculate the difference based on the non-negative integers present in the list, which might not be the intended behavior.
