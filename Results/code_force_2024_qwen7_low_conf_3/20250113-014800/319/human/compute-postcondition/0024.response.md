Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `q`, and `encrypted_values`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{22}\).
- `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 10^6\).
- `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers such that \(0 \leq e_i < n\) for each \(e_i\) in `encrypted_values`.

The function iterates over `encrypted_values`, computing a series of transformed values based on the previous value in the iteration and the current element of `encrypted_values`. Specifically, for each element `e_i` in `encrypted_values`, it calculates `v = (e_i + last) % n`, appends `v` to the list `a`, calls another function `func_2` on `a` to get `f_a`, updates `last` to `f_a`, and appends `f_a` to the results list. After completing the loop, the function returns the list `results` containing `q` elements, each being `f_a`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `encrypted_values` is non-empty and `q > 0`. If `q` is 0 or `encrypted_values` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `results` will be an empty list, which should be explicitly handled if needed.
- The function relies on the existence and correct behavior of `func_2`. If `func_2` does not handle edge cases correctly or behaves unexpectedly, it could affect the output of `func_1`.
- The function does not validate the input parameters `n` and `q` to ensure they meet their constraints. This validation should be included to prevent errors in case of incorrect inputs.**

This summary captures the core functionality and also highlights potential edge cases and missing validation checks.
