`a.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `a`. From the initial state, `v` is defined as (`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n. The value of `v` remains unchanged, and `a` is updated to include this new value.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `q` is at least 1 (unchanged)
- `v` is (`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n (unchanged)
- `a` now contains `[v]`, which means `a` is `[(`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n]`
- `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, which remains unchanged from its initial value
- `last` is equal to `f_a` (unchanged)
- `results` contains `[f_a]` (unchanged)

Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is at least 1, `v` is (`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n, `a` is `[(`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n]`, `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains `[f_a]`**
