Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `q` must be at least 1
   - `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`
   - `a` is a list containing `[v]`
   - `last` is `func_2([v])`
   - `results` contains `[f_a]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(q)`, meaning it will run `q` times.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, this is the first iteration of the loop.
   - At the end of the first iteration, `i` will become 1.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `q`.
   - Given that `i` is now 1 and `q` must be at least 1, the condition `i < q` is still satisfied as long as `q` is at least 2.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `q` remains unchanged and must still be at least 1.
   - `v` is recalculated based on the new state of `a` and `last`.
   - `a` will be updated to include the new value of `v`.
   - `last` will be updated to `func_2(a)`.
   - `results` will be updated to include `f_a`.

6. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `q` must be at least 1
   - `v` is recalculated as `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n` with the updated `a` and `last`.
   - `a` is updated to `[v]` (this will be updated further inside the loop).
   - `last` is updated to `func_2([v])`.
   - `results` is updated to `[f_a]` (this will be updated further inside the loop).

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be at least 1, `v` is recalculated as `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n` with the updated `a` and `last`, `a` is updated to include the new value of `v`, `last` is updated to `func_2(a)`, `results` is updated to include `f_a`**.

However, since we need to provide a concise state:

State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be at least 1**
