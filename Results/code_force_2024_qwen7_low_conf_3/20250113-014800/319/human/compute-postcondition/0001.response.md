`min_val` is assigned the value of the minimum element in the list `b`. The initial state is that `b` is a list of non-negative integers, and `max_val` is the maximum value in `b`. After running the code, `min_val` will hold the minimum value from the list `b`, but the value of `b` and `max_val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list of non-negative integers; `max_val` is the maximum value in `b`; `min_val` is the minimum value in `b`**
