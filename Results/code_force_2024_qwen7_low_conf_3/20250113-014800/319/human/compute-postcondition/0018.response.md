The code updates the value of `f_a` to the return value of `func_2(a)`. Given the initial state, `a` is `[(`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n]`, and `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`. After executing `f_a = func_2(a)`, `f_a` is updated to the return value of `func_2(a)`.

Since the exact return value of `func_2(a)` is not specified, we denote the return value as `new_f_a`. Therefore, the new value of `f_a` is `new_f_a`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is at least 1, `v` is (`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n, `a` is `[(`encrypted_values[2] + f_a`) % n]`, `f_a` is `new_f_a`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains `[f_a]`**
