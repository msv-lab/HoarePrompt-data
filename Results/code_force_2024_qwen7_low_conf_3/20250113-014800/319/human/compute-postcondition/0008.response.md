`results.append(f_a)` appends the value of `f_a` to the list `results`. However, the value of `f_a` is not defined in the given code snippet, so it remains unknown. The only change made by this line of code is the addition of `f_a` to `results`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `q`, `v`, `a`, `last`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `q` must be at least 1; `v` is (encrypted_values[0] + last) % n; `a` is a list containing [v]; `last` is func_2([v]); `results` contains [f_a]**
