### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to implement a function `func_1` that processes a series of queries to update an array `a` and compute the function `f(a)` after each update.
   - `f(b)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\), where \(|\) is the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in an array `b`, which is essentially the simple difference and not the bitwise OR difference.
   - `func_1` iterates through the encrypted values, decrypts them using the previous result (`last`), appends the decrypted value to `a`, and then computes `f(a)` using `func_2`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The function `func_2` does not account for the bitwise OR operation, so it cannot correctly compute `f(b)` as defined.
   - The problem requires the computation of the bitwise OR difference, which involves finding the maximum and minimum values of the bitwise OR of each element with all possible values of \(x\). This is a more complex operation than simply finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The current implementation of `func_2` only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the bitwise OR difference.
   - To correctly compute `f(b)`, one would need to iterate over all possible values of \(x\) (which is computationally infeasible due to the large range of \(x\)), or use a more sophisticated algorithm that accounts for the bitwise OR operation.

5. **Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1` assumes that `encrypted_values` is non-empty and `q > 0`. However, if `q` is 0 or `encrypted_values` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `results` will be an empty list, which should be explicitly handled.
   - The function `func_2` does not handle the case where the list `b` is empty, which would raise a `ValueError`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program is incorrect because it does not properly compute `f(b)` as defined in the problem statement. Specifically, `func_2` does not handle the bitwise OR operation required for the definition of `f(b)`.
   - Additionally, the program lacks proper handling for edge cases where the input might be empty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute `f(b)` as defined in the problem statement. Specifically, `func_2` does not perform the bitwise OR operation required for the definition of `f(b)`.
