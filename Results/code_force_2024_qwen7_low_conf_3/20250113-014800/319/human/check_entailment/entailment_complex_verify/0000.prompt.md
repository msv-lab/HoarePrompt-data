You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
For an array b of m non-negative integers, define f(b) as the maximum value of \max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) over all possible non-negative integers x , where | is [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

You are given integers n and q . You start with an empty array a . Process the
following q queries:

  * v : append v to the back of a and then output f(a) . It is guaranteed that 0 \leq v < n . 

The queries are given in a modified way.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n \leq
2^{22} , 1 \leq q \leq 10^6 ) — the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains q space-separated integers
e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_q (0 \leq e_i < n ) — the encrypted values of v .

Let \mathrm{last}_i equal the output of the (i-1) -th query for i\geq 2 and
\mathrm{last}_i=0 for i=1 . Then the value of v for the i -th query is (e_i +
\mathrm{last}_i ) modulo n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2^{22}
and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print q integers. The i -th integer is the output of the i
-th query.

Example

Input

    2
    
    5 2
    
    1 2
    
    7 4
    
    3 1 5 2

Output

    0 2
    0 2 3 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the final a=[1,2] . For i=1 , the answer is always 0 ,
irrespective of x . For i=2 , we can select x=5 .

In the second test case, the final a=[3,1,0,5] .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        a.append(v)
        f_a = func_2(a)
        last = f_a
        results.append(f_a)
    return results

#Function 2:
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    encrypted_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = func_1(n, q, encrypted_values)
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{22}\), q is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 10^6\), and encrypted_values is a list of q integers such that \(0 \leq e_i < n\) for each \(e_i\) in encrypted_values.
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        
        a.append(v)
        
        f_a = func_2(a)
        
        last = f_a
        
        results.append(f_a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `q - 1`, `v` is \((encrypted_values[q-1] + last) \% n\), `a` is a list containing all `v` values generated in each iteration, `f_a` is `func_2(a)`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains `q` elements, each being `f_a`
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` that contains `q` elements, each being `f_a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `q`, and `encrypted_values`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{22}\).
- `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 10^6\).
- `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers such that \(0 \leq e_i < n\) for each \(e_i\) in `encrypted_values`.

The function iterates over `encrypted_values`, computing a series of transformed values based on the previous value in the iteration and the current element of `encrypted_values`. Specifically, for each element `e_i` in `encrypted_values`, it calculates `v = (e_i + last) % n`, appends `v` to the list `a`, calls another function `func_2` on `a` to get `f_a`, updates `last` to `f_a`, and appends `f_a` to the results list. After completing the loop, the function returns the list `results` containing `q` elements, each being `f_a`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `encrypted_values` is non-empty and `q > 0`. If `q` is 0 or `encrypted_values` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `results` will be an empty list, which should be explicitly handled if needed.
- The function relies on the existence and correct behavior of `func_2`. If `func_2` does not handle edge cases correctly or behaves unexpectedly, it could affect the output of `func_1`.
- The function does not validate the input parameters `n` and `q` to ensure they meet their constraints. This validation should be included to prevent errors in case of incorrect inputs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a list of non-negative integers.
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val
    #`The program returns the difference between the maximum value (max_val) and the minimum value (min_val) in list 'b'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `b` of non-negative integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list `b` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle the case where the list contains negative numbers, although the initial annotation mentions non-negative integers.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical error in `func_2`. The function calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b`, but this approach does not account for the bitwise OR operation as required by the problem statement. Specifically, the function `f(b)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\), which means the function should consider the effect of the bitwise OR operation on the elements of the array.

The current implementation does not handle this requirement, and thus, it will not produce the correct output for the given problem description. For instance, consider the following scenario:

- Suppose `n = 8` and `q = 3`.
- The encrypted values are `[1, 2]`.
- For the first query, `v = (1 + 0) % 8 = 1`, so `a = [1]` and `f(a) = 0`.
- For the second query, `v = (2 + 0) % 8 = 2`, so `a = [1, 2]` and `f(a) = 0`.

However, the actual value of `f([1, 2])` considering the bitwise OR operation would be different. For example, if \(x = 3\) (binary `11`), then \(1 | 3 = 3\) and \(2 | 3 = 3\), making \(\max (1, 2 | 3) - \min (1, 2 | 3) = 3 - 3 = 0\). But since the problem requires considering all possible \(x\), the actual value could be higher.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the function \(f(b)\) as specified, leading to incorrect outputs.
