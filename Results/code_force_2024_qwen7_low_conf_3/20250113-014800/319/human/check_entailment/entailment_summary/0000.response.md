Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_2` Analysis**: 
   - `func_2` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list `b`. This matches the definition of \(f(b)\) in the problem statement. It works correctly for non-empty lists and handles the edge case of an empty list by raising a `ValueError`, which is not a concern here since the input lists will contain at least one element after processing the queries.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` correctly processes the queries as specified:
     - It initializes an empty list `a` and a variable `last` set to 0.
     - For each query, it calculates the transformed value `v` using the formula `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n`.
     - It appends `v` to the list `a` and calls `func_2` to compute `f(a)`.
     - It updates `last` to the computed `f(a)` and appends this value to the results list.
   - The loop correctly handles the transformation of encrypted values and computation of \(f(a)\) for each query.

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The main loop in the program correctly calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters for each test case.
   - The program outputs the results as required, ensuring that each query's output is printed in sequence.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the execution summaries of the functions confirm that each part of the logic is implemented correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
