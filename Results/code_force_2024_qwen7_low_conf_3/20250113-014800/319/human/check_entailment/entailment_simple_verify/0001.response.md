### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to implement a function `func_1` that processes a series of queries to update an array `a` and compute the function `f(a)` after each update.
   - `f(b)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\), where \(|\) is the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in an array `b`, which is not equivalent to \(f(b)\) as defined in the problem.
   - `func_1` iterates through the encrypted values, decrypts them using the previous result (`last`), appends the decrypted value to `a`, and then computes `f(a)` using `func_2`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - `func_2` does not account for the bitwise OR operation, so it cannot correctly compute \(f(b)\).
   - The problem requires computing \(f(a)\) which involves finding the maximum and minimum values after applying the bitwise OR operation with some non-negative integer \(x\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The given implementation of `func_2` is incorrect because it does not handle the bitwise OR operation.
   - To correctly compute \(f(b)\), we need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values after performing the bitwise OR operation with an appropriate \(x\). However, the provided code only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values directly.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_2` does not handle the bitwise OR operation and thus cannot correctly compute \(f(b)\).
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly updates the array `a` and calls `func_2` to compute the difference, but `func_2` itself is flawed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The given program does not correctly compute \(f(b)\) as defined in the problem statement because `func_2` does not account for the bitwise OR operation. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
