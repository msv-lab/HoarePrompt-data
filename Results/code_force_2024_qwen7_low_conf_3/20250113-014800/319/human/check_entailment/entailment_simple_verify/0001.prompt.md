You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
For an array b of m non-negative integers, define f(b) as the maximum value of \max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) over all possible non-negative integers x , where | is [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

You are given integers n and q . You start with an empty array a . Process the
following q queries:

  * v : append v to the back of a and then output f(a) . It is guaranteed that 0 \leq v < n . 

The queries are given in a modified way.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n \leq
2^{22} , 1 \leq q \leq 10^6 ) — the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains q space-separated integers
e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_q (0 \leq e_i < n ) — the encrypted values of v .

Let \mathrm{last}_i equal the output of the (i-1) -th query for i\geq 2 and
\mathrm{last}_i=0 for i=1 . Then the value of v for the i -th query is (e_i +
\mathrm{last}_i ) modulo n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2^{22}
and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print q integers. The i -th integer is the output of the i
-th query.

Example

Input

    2
    
    5 2
    
    1 2
    
    7 4
    
    3 1 5 2

Output

    0 2
    0 2 3 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the final a=[1,2] . For i=1 , the answer is always 0 ,
irrespective of x . For i=2 , we can select x=5 .

In the second test case, the final a=[3,1,0,5] .

    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` that contains `q` elements, each being `f_a`

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to implement a function `func_1` that processes a series of queries to update an array `a` and compute the function `f(a)` after each update.
   - `f(b)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\), where \(|\) is the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in an array `b`, which is essentially `f(b)` but without the bitwise OR operation.
   - `func_1` iterates through the encrypted values, decrypts them using the previous result (`last`), appends the decrypted value to `a`, and then computes `f(a)` using `func_2`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The function `func_2` does not account for the bitwise OR operation, so it cannot correctly compute `f(b)` as defined.
   - To correctly compute `f(b)`, one would need to consider the bitwise OR operation, which is not done in `func_2`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - Given the problem's definition of `f(b)`, the current implementation of `func_2` is insufficient because it does not handle the bitwise OR operation.
   - Therefore, the given program will not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly compute `f(b)` as defined in the problem statement. Specifically, `func_2` does not perform the bitwise OR operation required for the definition of `f(b)`.
