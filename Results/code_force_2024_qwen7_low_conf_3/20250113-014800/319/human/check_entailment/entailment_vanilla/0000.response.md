### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to implement a function `func_1` that processes a series of queries to update an array `a` and compute the function `f(a)` after each update.
   - `f(b)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\), where \(|\) is the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in an array `b`, which is essentially `f(b)` but without the bitwise OR operation.
   - `func_1` iterates through the encrypted values, decrypts them using the previous result (`last`), appends the decrypted value to `a`, and then computes `f(a)` using `func_2`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The function `func_2` does not account for the bitwise OR operation, so it cannot correctly compute `f(b)` as defined.
   - To correctly compute `f(b)`, one would need to consider the bitwise OR operation, which is not done in `func_2`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - Given the problem's definition of `f(b)`, the current implementation of `func_2` is insufficient because it does not handle the bitwise OR operation.
   - Therefore, the given program will not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly compute `f(b)` as defined in the problem statement. Specifically, `func_2` does not perform the bitwise OR operation required for the definition of `f(b)`.
