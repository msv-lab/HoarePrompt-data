Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function processes a series of queries to construct the array `a` and compute `f(a)` for each query.
   - The logic of updating `last` and constructing `results` is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The use of `func_2` to compute `f(a)` is correct and appropriate.
   - Edge cases like empty `encrypted_values` or `q == 0` are not explicitly handled, but the problem guarantees non-empty `encrypted_values` and `q > 0`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function computes `f(b)` correctly as defined in the problem statement.
   - The computation of `max_val - min_val` accurately reflects the required operation.
   - The function raises a `ValueError` when the list `b` is empty, which is handled implicitly by the problem's constraints ensuring non-empty lists.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic correctly processes each query and updates the array `a` and the result list `results`.
   - The transformation of `v` using `(e_i + last) % n` is consistent with the problem statement.

Given that both functions operate as intended and the main program logic adheres to the problem constraints, the overall program meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
