Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical error in `func_2`. The function calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b`, but this approach does not account for the bitwise OR operation as required by the problem statement. Specifically, the function `f(b)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\), which means the function should consider the effect of the bitwise OR operation on the elements of the array.

The current implementation does not handle this requirement, and thus, it will not produce the correct output for the given problem description. For instance, consider the following scenario:

- Suppose `n = 8` and `q = 3`.
- The encrypted values are `[1, 2]`.
- For the first query, `v = (1 + 0) % 8 = 1`, so `a = [1]` and `f(a) = 0`.
- For the second query, `v = (2 + 0) % 8 = 2`, so `a = [1, 2]` and `f(a) = 0`.

However, the actual value of `f([1, 2])` considering the bitwise OR operation would be different. For example, if \(x = 3\) (binary `11`), then \(1 | 3 = 3\) and \(2 | 3 = 3\), making \(\max (1, 2 | 3) - \min (1, 2 | 3) = 3 - 3 = 0\). But since the problem requires considering all possible \(x\), the actual value could be higher.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the function \(f(b)\) as specified, leading to incorrect outputs.
