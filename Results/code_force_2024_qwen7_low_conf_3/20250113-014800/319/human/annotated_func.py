#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{22}\), q is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 10^6\), and encrypted_values is a list of q integers such that \(0 \leq e_i < n\) for each \(e_i\) in encrypted_values.
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        
        a.append(v)
        
        f_a = func_2(a)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `q - 1`, `v` is \((encrypted_values[q-1] + last) \% n\), `a` is a list containing all `v` values generated in each iteration, `f_a` is `func_2(a)`, `last` is equal to `f_a`, and `results` contains `q` elements, each being `f_a`
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` that contains `q` elements, each being `f_a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `q`, and `encrypted_values`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{22}\).
- `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 10^6\).
- `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers such that \(0 \leq e_i < n\) for each \(e_i\) in `encrypted_values`.

The function iterates over `encrypted_values`, computing a series of transformed values based on the previous value in the iteration and the current element of `encrypted_values`. Specifically, for each element `e_i` in `encrypted_values`, it calculates `v = (e_i + last) % n`, appends `v` to the list `a`, calls another function `func_2` on `a` to get `f_a`, updates `last` to `f_a`, and appends `f_a` to the results list. After completing the loop, the function returns the list `results` containing `q` elements, each being `f_a`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `encrypted_values` is non-empty and `q > 0`. If `q` is 0 or `encrypted_values` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `results` will be an empty list, which should be explicitly handled if needed.
- The function relies on the existence and correct behavior of `func_2`. If `func_2` does not handle edge cases correctly or behaves unexpectedly, it could affect the output of `func_1`.
- The function does not validate the input parameters `n` and `q` to ensure they meet their constraints. This validation should be included to prevent errors in case of incorrect inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a list of non-negative integers.
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val
    #`The program returns the difference between the maximum value (max_val) and the minimum value (min_val) in list 'b'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `b` of non-negative integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list `b` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle the case where the list contains negative numbers, although the initial annotation mentions non-negative integers.
