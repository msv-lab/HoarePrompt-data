The function `func_2` accepts a list `b` of non-negative integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list `b` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle the case where the list contains negative numbers, although the initial annotation mentions non-negative integers.
