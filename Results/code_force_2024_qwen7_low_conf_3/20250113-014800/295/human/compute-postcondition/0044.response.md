The code `median_index = (n - 1) // 2` does not change the value of `median_index` because it is simply reassigning the same value to `median_index`. The previous value of `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, which is unchanged. All other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is the total number of increments added during the loop, `results` is a list containing `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
