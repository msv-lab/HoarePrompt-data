`operations` is incremented by the value of `median + 1 - a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`, the value of `median + 1 - a[i]` is positive. The exact updated value of `operations` depends on the specific values of `median` and `a[i]`. However, since the exact values are not provided, we can express the updated value in terms of these variables.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `median` is `a[median_index]`
- `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`
- `operations` is incremented by `median + 1 - a[i]`
- `results` is a list containing the updated `operations`
- `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- The value of `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is incremented by `median + 1 - a[i]`, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, the value of `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`**
