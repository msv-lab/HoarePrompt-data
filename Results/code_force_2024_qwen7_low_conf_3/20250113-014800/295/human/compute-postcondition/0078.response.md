Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
1. `t` is a positive integer.
2. `a` is a sorted list of integers.
3. `a[m]` is increased by 1.
4. `m` is either `n // 2` if it was initially `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 1` if it was initially `n // 2`.
5. `a[m + 1]` is increased by 1.
6. `a[m + 1]` must be less than `a[m]` and `m + 1` must be less than `n`.
7. `cnt` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
while m + 1 < n and a[m + 1] < a[m]:
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `m + 1 < n`:**
   - This condition ensures that `m + 1` is within the bounds of the list `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `m + 1` must be less than `n`.

2. **Condition `a[m + 1] < a[m]`:**
   - This condition ensures that the element at index `m + 1` is less than the element at index `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a[m + 1]` must be less than `a[m]`.

### Required Adjustments:
- For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied.
- Therefore, we need to ensure that `m + 1` is still less than `n` and `a[m + 1]` is still less than `a[m]`.

### State Adjustment:
- `m + 1` must be less than `n`.
- `a[m + 1]` must be less than `a[m]`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1; `m` is `n // 2` if it was initially `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 1` if it was initially `n // 2`; `a[m + 1]` must be less than `a[m]` and `m + 1` must be less than `n`**
