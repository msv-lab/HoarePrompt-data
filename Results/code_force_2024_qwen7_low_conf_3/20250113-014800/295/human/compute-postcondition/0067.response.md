The value of `n` is divided by 2 and then decremented by 1, assigning the result to `m`. The initial value of `n` was an input integer, so `m` will be `n // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer, the number of iterations left is `input - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer, the number of iterations left is `input - 2`**
