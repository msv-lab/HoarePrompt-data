`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `a` and `results` remain as they were in the initial state. The value of `_` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
