The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element into an integer, then assigns the resulting list to `a`. The original value of `m` (which was `n // 2`) and the original value of `n` (an input integer) are still valid, but `a` is now updated based on the new input. The number of iterations left (`input - 2`) is also still valid.

Since the exact input is not specified, we can denote the new input as `new_input`, which is a list of integers. After converting this input, `a` will be a list of these integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers (based on the input `new_input`), `m` is either `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer, the number of iterations left is `input - 2`.**
