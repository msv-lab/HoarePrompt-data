`cnt` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1; `m` is either `n // 2 - 1` or `n // 2`, depending on whether `n % 2 == 0` is true or false; the number of iterations left is `input - 2`; `cnt` is 1.
