Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str` and sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is updated based on the condition that `a[i] < median + 1` (it becomes the sum of `(median + 1 - a[i])` for each `i` in the list `a` where `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`), `median_index` is the index of the median in the sorted list `a`, `i` is `median_index + 2`. If `a[i] < median + 1`, `operations` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.***
