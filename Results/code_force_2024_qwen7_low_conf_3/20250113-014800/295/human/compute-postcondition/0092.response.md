The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly in its definition. However, it implies that the function will handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of inputs. Specifically, for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by for each test case, an integer `n` indicating the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of positive integers where each element satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). Additionally, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the return value is not detailed in the provided information.
