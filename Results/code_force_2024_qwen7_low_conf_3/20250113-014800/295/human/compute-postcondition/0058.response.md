The code `results.append(operations)` appends the current value of `operations` to the list `results`. The value of `results` changes, and no other variables are affected.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `median` is `a[median_index]` where `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `operations` is the sum of `median + 1 - a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[median_index, n-1]` such that `a[i] < median + 1`.
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `operations`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n` (or the last index processed).

After executing the code, `results` will contain the updated value of `operations`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is `a[median_index]` where `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is the sum of `median + 1 - a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[median_index, n-1]` such that `a[i] < median + 1`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `operations` which is now updated, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n` (or the last index processed).**
