The code updates the `operations` variable by adding the value of `median + 1 - a[i]`. Here, `median` is defined as `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, and `i` is set to `median_index + 1` and is less than `n`. The value of `operations` is increased by this difference.

Since the initial state includes that `a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order, `median` is the middle element, and `operations` is updated based on the condition involving `a[i]` and `median`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `operations`.

Let's denote the specific value of `median` as `med_val`. Given the conditions, the output state will be:

- `a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order.
- `median` is `med_val`.
- `median_index` remains as `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `i` is `median_index + 1` and less than `n`.
- `operations` is updated to `operations + (median + 1 - a[i])`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order, `median` is `med_val`, `median_index` remains as `(n - 1) // 2`, `i` is `median_index + 1` and less than `n`, `operations` is updated to `operations + (median + 1 - a[i])**.
