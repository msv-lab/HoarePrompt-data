Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1.
- `m` is either `n // 2 - 1` or `n // 2`, depending on whether `n % 2 == 0` is true or false.
- The number of iterations left is `input - 2`.
- `cnt` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
while m + 1 < n and a[m + 1] < a[m]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `m + 1 < n`:**
   - This condition checks if the index `m + 1` is within the bounds of the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `m + 1` should be less than `n`.

2. **Condition `a[m + 1] < a[m]`:**
   - This condition checks if the element at index `m + 1` in the list `a` is less than the element at index `m`. For the loop to execute, this condition must be true.

### Current States:
- `m` is either `n // 2 - 1` or `n // 2`.
- Therefore, `m + 1` will be either `n // 2` or `n // 2 + 1`.

Given that `a` is a sorted list, and `a[m]` is increased by 1, let's consider the possible values of `m` and `m + 1`:

- If `m = n // 2 - 1`, then `m + 1 = n // 2`.
- If `m = n // 2`, then `m + 1 = n // 2 + 1`.

For the loop to execute:
- The condition `m + 1 < n` must hold true.
- The condition `a[m + 1] < a[m]` must hold true.

Since `a` is sorted, `a[m + 1]` should be less than `a[m]` for the loop to continue. Given that `a[m]` is already increased by 1, `a[m + 1]` must be strictly less than `a[m]` for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time:
- `m + 1 < n` must hold true.
- `a[m + 1] < a[m]` must hold true.

Since `m` is determined based on `n`, we do not need to change `m`. We need to ensure that `a[m + 1]` is indeed less than `a[m]` and that `m + 1` is within bounds.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1; `m` is either `n // 2 - 1` or `n // 2`, depending on whether `n % 2 == 0` is true or false; the number of iterations left is `input - 2`; `cnt` is 1; `a[m + 1]` must be less than `a[m]` and `m + 1` must be less than `n`**
