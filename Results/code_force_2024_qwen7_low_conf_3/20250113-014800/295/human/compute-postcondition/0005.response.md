`a` is sorted in ascending order. The original values of the other variables are not affected, so `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, and `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str` and `a` is sorted in ascending order.**
