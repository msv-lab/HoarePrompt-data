The code assigns the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]` to the variable `median`. This means that `median` is now directly set to the middle element of the sorted list `a_sorted`.

Given the initial state:
- `a_sorted` is now sorted in ascending order
- `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`
- `operations` is the sum of `(median + 1 - a_sorted[i])` for each `i` in the range `[median_index, n)` where `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`
- `median_index` is now `(n - 1) // 2`

After executing the code `median = a_sorted[median_index]`, `median` is directly set to the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`. Since `median_index` is already defined as `(n - 1) // 2`, this assignment does not change the value of `median` from its previous state.

Therefore, the updated state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a_sorted` is now sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is the sum of `(median + 1 - a_sorted[i])` for each `i` in the range `[median_index, n)` where `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`, `median_index` is now `(n - 1) // 2`**
