Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers in sorted order with `a[m]` increased by 1.
   - `m` is either `n // 2`.
   - The number of iterations left is `input - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - If `a[m - 1] <= a[m]` and `a[m] <= a[m + 1]`, then `print(1)` and the loop ends.
   - If `a[m] > a[m + 1]`, then `m` is set to `n - 1`, `cnt` is set to `input`, and `a[m + 1]` is updated to the original value of `a[n // 2 + 1]` plus `input - 1`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, no changes occur.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - The loop runs for `int(input())` times.
   - After each iteration, the state needs to be updated based on the loop condition.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the new state for the next iteration.
   - Since the loop has one more iteration left (as given by `input - 1`), we need to adjust the state accordingly.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The number of iterations left decreases by 1.
   - Therefore, the number of iterations left becomes `(input - 1) - 1 = input - 2`.

Given the above steps, the new state for the next iteration would be:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop condition.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified unless the specific conditions are met, but since we are moving to the next iteration, it remains as it was before the check.
- `m` remains `n // 2` because the conditions do not change its value for the next iteration.
- The number of iterations left is now `input - 2`.

Thus, the new state for the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers in sorted order with `a[m]` increased by 1, `m` is either `n // 2`, and the number of iterations left is `input - 2`.**
