Postcondition: **`a_sorted` is now sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is 0, `median_index` is now `(n - 1) // 2`, and `median_index` must be less than `n`. Additionally, `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`, where `i` is the current index being considered.**
