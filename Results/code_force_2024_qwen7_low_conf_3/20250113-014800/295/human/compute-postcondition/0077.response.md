`cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:
- `t` is a positive integer (unchanged)
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1 (unchanged since `m` is now different)
- `m` is `n // 2` if it was initially `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 1` if it was initially `n // 2` (unchanged)
- `a[m + 1]` is increased by 1 (unchanged since `m` is now different, and `m + 1` does not change this value)
- `a[m + 1]` must be less than `a[m]` and `m + 1` must be less than `n` (unchanged since these conditions are dependent on `m` and `n` which have not changed in a way that would violate these conditions)

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1; `m` is `n // 2` if it was initially `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 1` if it was initially `n // 2`; `a[m + 1]` is increased by 1; `a[m + 1]` must be less than `a[m]` and `m + 1` must be less than `n`; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
