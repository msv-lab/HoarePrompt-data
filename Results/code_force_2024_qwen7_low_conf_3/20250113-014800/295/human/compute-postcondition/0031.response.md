Postcondition: ***`a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is updated to `0 + (median + 1 - a[i])` if `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`, and `median_index` remains as `(n - 1) // 2`. If `a_sorted[i]` is not less than `median + 1`, the conditions remain unchanged.***
