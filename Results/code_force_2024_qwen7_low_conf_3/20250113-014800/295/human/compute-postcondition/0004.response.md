The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The previous values of the variables `t`, `n`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged. 

Since the exact input values are not provided, we can represent the new value of `a` in terms of the input. Let's denote the input as `input_str`, which is a space-separated string of integers. After processing this input, `a` will be a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str`**
