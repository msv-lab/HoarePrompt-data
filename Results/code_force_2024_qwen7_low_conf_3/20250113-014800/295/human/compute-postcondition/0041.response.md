The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This input is expected to be an integer. The other variables (`a_sorted`, `median`, `median_index`, `operations`, `results`, and `t`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is the total number of increments added during the loop, `results` is a list containing `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
