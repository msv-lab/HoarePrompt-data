The function `func` accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function processes an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n` where each `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). Additionally, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the given constraints and relationships, the function returns different outputs depending on the specific requirements of each test case, but since the exact output logic is not provided, we can only describe the input parameters.
