According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `median_index` and `n`. The loop will execute if `median_index` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `a_sorted` is now sorted in ascending order
- `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`
- `operations` is 0
- `median_index` is now `(n - 1) // 2`

For the loop to execute, `median_index` must be less than `n`, because the loop iterates from `median_index` to `n-1`.

So, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `median_index` is less than `n`.

State: **`a_sorted` is now sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is 0, `median_index` is now `(n - 1) // 2`, and `median_index` must be less than `n`**
