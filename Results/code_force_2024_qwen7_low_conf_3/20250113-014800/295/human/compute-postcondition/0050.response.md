Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is incremented by the difference between `median + 1` and `a[i]` if `a[i] < median + 1`, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.***
