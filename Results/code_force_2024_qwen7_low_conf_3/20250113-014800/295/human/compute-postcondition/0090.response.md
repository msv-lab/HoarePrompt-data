Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `n == 1`, the print statement outputs `1`. Otherwise, if the condition `a[m - 1] <= a[m] and a[m] <= a[m + 1]` is true, then `a[m]` is incremented by 1 and "1" is printed. If the condition is false, `a[m]` and `a[m + 1]` are each incremented by `cnt`, `m` is adjusted accordingly, and "cnt" is printed. The number of iterations left is `input - 2`.***
