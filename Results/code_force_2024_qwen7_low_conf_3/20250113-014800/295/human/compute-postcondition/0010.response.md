Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str` and sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is 0, `median_index` is less than `n`. For each index `i` in the list `a`, the value of `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`***
