`results.append(operations)` appends the value of `operations` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `results` will contain the value of `operations`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is now a list containing the value of `operations`, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str` and sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is the sum of `(median + 1 - a[i])` for each `i` in the range `[median_index, n)` where `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`, `median_index` is the index of the median in the sorted list `a`.**
