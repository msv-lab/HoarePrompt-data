`m` is incremented by 1. Initially, `m` is either `n // 2` if it was `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 1` if it was `n // 2`. After incrementing `m` by 1, the new value of `m` will be `n // 2` if it was `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 2` if it was `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1; `a[m + 1]` is a value that is 1 greater than its previous value; `m` is `n // 2` if it was initially `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 2` if it was initially `n // 2`.**
