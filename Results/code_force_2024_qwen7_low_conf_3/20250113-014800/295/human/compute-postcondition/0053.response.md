Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `operations` is incremented by the difference between `median + 1` and `a[i]` if `a[i] < median + 1`, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is \((n - 1) // 2 + 1\). Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the one provided for the if part.***
