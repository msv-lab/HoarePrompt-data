`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `t`, the structure of the list `a`, and the value of `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1; `a[m + 1]` is a value that is 1 greater than its previous value; `m` is `n // 2` if it was initially `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 2` if it was initially `n // 2`; `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by 1; `a[m + 1]` is a value that is 1 greater than its previous value; `m` is `n // 2` if it was initially `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 2` if it was initially `n // 2`; `cnt` is increased by 1.**
