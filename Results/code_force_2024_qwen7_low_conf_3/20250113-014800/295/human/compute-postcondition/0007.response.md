The code assigns the value of `a[median_index]` to `median`. Here, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers. Since `a` is already sorted, `a[median_index]` is the median value of the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str` and sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]`, which is `(n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str` and sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a[(n - 1) // 2]`**
