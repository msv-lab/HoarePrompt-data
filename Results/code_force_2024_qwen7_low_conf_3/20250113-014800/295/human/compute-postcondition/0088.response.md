Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where `a[m]` has been increased by `cnt` times, and `a[m + 1]` has also been increased by `cnt` times. The value of `m` is adjusted based on its initial value and the count `cnt`. The variable `cnt` is printed, and the number of iterations left is `input - 2`. If the if condition is true, the specified increments and printing occur. If the if condition is false, no additional changes are made.***
