`a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial state of `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input `new_input`, `m` is either `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer, and the number of iterations left is `input - 2`. After sorting, the list `a` will be sorted but the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, and the number of iterations left remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is either `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer, the number of iterations left is `input - 2`.**
