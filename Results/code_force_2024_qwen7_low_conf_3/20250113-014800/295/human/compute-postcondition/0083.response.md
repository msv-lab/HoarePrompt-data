The code `a[m + 1] += 1` increments the value at index `m + 1` in the list `a` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers where `a[m]` is increased by 1, and `a[m + 1]` is a value that is 1 greater than its previous value.
- `m` is either `n // 2` if it was initially `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + 2` if it was initially `n // 2`.
- `cnt` is increased by 1.

Since the code only affects `a[m + 1]`, the value of `a[m + 1]` will be incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `t` remains a positive integer.
- `a` is a sorted list where `a[m]` is increased by 1, `a[m + 1]` is now 2 greater than its previous value (since it was 1 greater before and now incremented by 1), and the rest of the list remains unchanged.
- `m` remains the same.
- `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list where `a[m]` is increased by 1 and `a[m + 1]` is 2 greater than its previous value; `m` is the same; `cnt` is increased by 1.**
