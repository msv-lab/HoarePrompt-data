`m` is reassigned the value of `n // 2`, where `n` is an input integer. The previous value of `m` was either `n // 2`, but now it is explicitly set to `n // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is n // 2, `n` is an input integer, the number of iterations left is input - 2**
