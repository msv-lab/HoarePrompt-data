The code assigns the value of `(n - 1) // 2` to the variable `median_index`. This does not change the values of `a_sorted`, `median`, `operations`, or `median_index` except for explicitly setting `median_index` to the computed value. The previous value of `median_index` was undefined, but now it is known to be `(n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`a_sorted` is now sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is the sum of `(median + 1 - a_sorted[i])` for each `i` in the range `[median_index, n)` where `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`, `median_index` is now `(n - 1) // 2`**
