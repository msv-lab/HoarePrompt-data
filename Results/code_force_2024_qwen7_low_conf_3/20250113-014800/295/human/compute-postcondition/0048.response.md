Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2` and must be less than `n`, `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, the value of `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`**
