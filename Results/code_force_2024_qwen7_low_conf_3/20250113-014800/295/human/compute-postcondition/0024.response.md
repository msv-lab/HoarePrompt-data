The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a`. Sorting `a` rearranges its elements in ascending order. Since the initial state of `a` is not explicitly given other than being a list of integers not necessarily sorted, let's denote the sorted list as `a_sorted`.

Given the initial state, the output state after sorting `a` is:

- `a` is now sorted in ascending order (let's call it `a_sorted`).
- `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`.
- `operations` is the sum of `(median + 1 - a_sorted[i])` for each `i` in the range `[median_index, n)` where `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`.
- `median_index` is the index of the median in the sorted list `a_sorted`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified, we can't compute the exact value of `operations` or `median_index`. However, the impact on the variables is clear.

Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order (denote it as `a_sorted`), `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is the sum of `(median + 1 - a_sorted[i])` for each `i` in the range `[median_index, n)` where `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`, `median_index` is the index of the median in the sorted list `a_sorted`.**
