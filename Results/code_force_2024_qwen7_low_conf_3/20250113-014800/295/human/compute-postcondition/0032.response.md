According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `median_index` to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:

- `a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order.
- `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`.
- `operations` is updated to `0 + (median + 1 - a[i])` if `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`, and `median_index` remains as `(n - 1) // 2` if `a_sorted[i]` is not less than `median + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `median_index`, and the conditions remain unchanged.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `median_index + 1`. Since the condition for the loop is that `i` should be less than `n`, `median_index + 1` must still be less than `n`.

State: **`a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is updated to `0 + (median + 1 - a[i])` if `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`, and `median_index` remains as `(n - 1) // 2` if `a_sorted[i]` is not less than `median + 1`, and `i` is `median_index + 1` and less than `n`.**
