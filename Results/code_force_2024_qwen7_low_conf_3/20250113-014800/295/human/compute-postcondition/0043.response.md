`a` is sorted using the `sort()` method, which arranges the elements in ascending order. The median and its index remain unchanged because sorting does not affect the value of `median` or `median_index`. The `operations` and `results` variables also remain unchanged since no operations affecting these variables are performed. `t` is decremented by 1 but remains greater than 0. Therefore, the only change is that the list `a` is now sorted.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is the total number of increments added during the loop, `results` is a list containing `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
