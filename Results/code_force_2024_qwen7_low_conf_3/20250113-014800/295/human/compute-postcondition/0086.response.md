Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `a[m]` increased by `cnt` times; `m` is `n // 2` if the initial value of `m` was `n // 2 - 1`, or `n // 2 + cnt` if the initial value of `m` was `n // 2`; `a[m + 1]` is increased by `cnt` times; `cnt` is the number of iterations the loop executed; `input - 2` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute at all.**
