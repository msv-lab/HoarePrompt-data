`m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` was such that `a[m]` was increased by 1 and `a[m + 1]` was 2 greater than its previous value. This relationship still holds, but now `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list where `a[m]` is increased by 1 and `a[m + 1]` is 2 greater than its previous value; `m` is increased by 1; `cnt` is increased by 1.**
