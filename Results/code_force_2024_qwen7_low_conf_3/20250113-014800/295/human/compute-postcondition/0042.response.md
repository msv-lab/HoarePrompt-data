The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. However, the initial state does not provide the specific values of the input or the length of `a_sorted`, so we cannot determine the exact state of `a_sorted` after this operation. We can only say that `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

The other variables (`median`, `median_index`, `operations`, `results`, `t`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code, so they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is the total number of increments added during the loop, `results` is a list containing `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
