The code `median = a[median_index]` simply assigns the value at index `median_index` in the list `a` to the variable `median`. Given the initial state, the value of `median` was already defined as `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, which means it is now re-assigned to the same value from the list `a` at the same index.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `median` is now set to the value of `a[median_index]`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is the total number of increments added during the loop, `results` is a list containing `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
