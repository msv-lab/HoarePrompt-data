The code snippet prints each element in the `results` list converted to a string, separated by newlines. This operation does not change the values of any variables but merely outputs their values. The `results` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list of integers, each integer represents the number of increments required for each input array `a`, `median` is the median value of each sorted array `a`, `median_index` is the index of the median in each sorted array `a`, `operations` is the total number of increments calculated for each array `a`, `n` is the length of each array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `_` is the loop counter ranging from 0 to `t-1`. Each element in `results` has been printed to the console.**
