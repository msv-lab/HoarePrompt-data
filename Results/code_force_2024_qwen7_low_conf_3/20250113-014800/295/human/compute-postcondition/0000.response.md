`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) are not affected by this operation until further code is executed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
