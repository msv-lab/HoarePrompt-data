Postcondition: ***`a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order, `median` remains as `median + 1`, `median_index` remains as `(n - 1) // 2`, `i` is `median_index + 2` and less than `n`, and `operations` is updated to `operations + (median + 1 - a[i])` if `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.***
