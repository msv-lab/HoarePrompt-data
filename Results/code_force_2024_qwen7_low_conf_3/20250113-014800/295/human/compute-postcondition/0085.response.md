`cnt` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `cnt` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list where `a[m]` is increased by 1 and `a[m + 1]` is 2 greater than its previous value; `m` is increased by 1; `cnt` is increased by 1 (which means `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list where `a[m]` is increased by 1 and `a[m + 1]` is 2 greater than its previous value; `m` is increased by 1; `cnt` is `cnt + 1`**
