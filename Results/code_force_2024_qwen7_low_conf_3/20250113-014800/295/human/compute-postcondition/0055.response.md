`operations` is incremented by the value of `median + 1 - a[i]`. Given that `i` is \((n - 1) // 2 + 2\), we can substitute this into the expression to get `median + 1 - a[(n - 1) // 2 + 2]`. The value of `median` is `a[median_index]`, and since `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), we have `median = a[(n - 1) // 2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `operations` is the old value of `operations` plus `a[(n - 1) // 2] + 1 - a[(n - 1) // 2 + 2]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `operations` is incremented by `a[(n - 1) // 2] + 1 - a[(n - 1) // 2 + 2]`, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is \((n - 1) // 2 + 2\)**
