The code `operations += median + 1 - a[i]` updates the value of `operations` by adding the result of `median + 1 - a[i]` to the current value of `operations`. Given that `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`, and since `a[i]` is from the sorted list `a_sorted`, it means `a[i]` is also less than `median + 1`. 

Since `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`, the expression `median + 1 - a[i]` will result in a positive number (since `median + 1` is greater than `a[i]`). This positive number is added to `operations`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order.
- `median` is `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`.
- `operations` is initially `0`.
- `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`.

After executing the code, `operations` will be updated by adding the value of `median + 1 - a[i]` to its current value.

Output State: **`a_sorted` is sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is `0 + (median + 1 - a[i])`, `median_index` is now `(n - 1) // 2`, and `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`.**
