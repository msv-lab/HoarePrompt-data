The code assigns the value of `(n - 1) // 2` to `median_index`. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `median_index` is calculated based on this input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `median_index`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str` and sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`**
