The code `operations = 0` sets the variable `operations` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `operations`, which was the sum of `(median + 1 - a_sorted[i])` for each `i` in the range `[median_index, n)` where `a_sorted[i]` is less than `median + 1`. The other variables (`a_sorted`, `median`, `median_index`) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`a_sorted` is now sorted in ascending order; `median` is the value of `a_sorted[(n - 1) // 2]`; `operations` is 0; `median_index` is now `(n - 1) // 2`**
