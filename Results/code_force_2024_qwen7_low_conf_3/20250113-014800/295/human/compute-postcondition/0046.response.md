The code sets `operations` to 0. This initializes `operations` to 0 without affecting any other variables.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing `operations`, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
