Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers. For each array, it calculates the number of increments needed to ensure that no element in the array is less than the median of the array plus one. The median is determined after sorting the array. The function outputs the number of increments required for each array in a newline-separated format. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is taken to be the lower of the two middle elements. The function handles arrays of lengths up to 100,000 and ensures that all integers in the arrays are between 1 and 10^9. Potential edge cases include empty arrays or arrays with a single element, which would result in no increments being required.**
