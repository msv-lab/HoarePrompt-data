The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variables `t` and `n` are already defined in the initial state, but no operations are performed on them in this code snippet. The list `results` is simply initialized, so its current state is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list**
