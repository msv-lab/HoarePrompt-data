The code initializes a variable `operations` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `results`, `_`, `a`, and `median` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from `input_str` and sorted in ascending order, `median` is the value of `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is 0**
