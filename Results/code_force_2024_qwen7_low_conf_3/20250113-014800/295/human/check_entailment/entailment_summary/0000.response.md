Reasoning:
1. **Test Cases Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over each test case and processing the arrays accordingly.
2. **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the array before calculating the median, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. **Median Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the median index using `(n - 1) // 2` for both even and odd-length arrays, ensuring the median is correctly identified.
4. **Operations Calculation**: The function iterates through the array starting from the median index and counts the number of operations needed to make every element greater than or equal to `median + 1`. This approach is correct as it aims to increase the median by making sure no element is less than the new median value.
5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays with a single element, which would require no operations since the median would already be the only element.

Given the above points, the function appears to follow the requirements of the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
