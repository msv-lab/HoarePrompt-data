Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program only considers elements from the median index to the end of the array when calculating the number of operations needed. This approach fails to account for the possibility that increasing earlier elements might be more efficient in some cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5
5 5 4 5 5
```

The median of the array `[5, 5, 4, 5, 5]` is `5`. To increase the median, we need to make sure the element at the median index (which is `4` in the sorted array) becomes greater than `5`. However, the program only checks elements from the median index onwards and would incorrectly determine that no operations are needed since `5 >= 5`.

A correct solution should consider all elements up to and including the median index to ensure the median can be increased with the minimum number of operations.
