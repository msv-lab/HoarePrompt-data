Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then reads `n` integers into the list `a`.
   - These steps match the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Sorting and Median Calculation**:
   - The array `a` is sorted using `a.sort()`.
   - The median index is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2` which aligns with the requirement to find the element at the position `\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil` in the sorted array.
   - The median is determined by accessing the element at the calculated index `median_index`.

3. **Operations Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the elements from the median index to the end of the array.
   - For each element less than the current median (`median + 1`), it calculates the difference and accumulates it into `operations`.
   - This step correctly accounts for the number of operations needed to make the median larger.

4. **Result Collection**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in the `results` list.
   - Finally, the program prints the results in the required format.

Given these points, the program accurately computes the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case, following the exact logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
