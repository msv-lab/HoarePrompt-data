Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of each array. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is done correctly by reading the length of the array `n` and the array itself for each test case.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted. Sorting is necessary to correctly identify the median.

3. **Calculating the Median Index**: The median index is calculated using `(n - 1) // 2`. Note that for even `n`, the lower median is used. This is correct as per the definition of the median.

4. **Determining the Current Median**: The current median is obtained from the sorted array `a` at the calculated index `median_index`.

5. **Counting Operations**: The program iterates over the part of the array from the median index to the end and counts the number of operations needed to make each element greater than or equal to the median plus one. This is done using `median + 1 - a[i]` for each element that is less than `median + 1`.

6. **Storing Results**: The number of operations required for each test case is stored in the `results` list.

7. **Outputting Results**: Finally, the results are printed in a newline-separated format.

Given that the program follows the steps outlined in the problem description accurately and correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
