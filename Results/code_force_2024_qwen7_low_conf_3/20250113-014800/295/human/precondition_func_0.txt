t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 \le n \le 10^5 and 1 \le a_i \le 10^9. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
