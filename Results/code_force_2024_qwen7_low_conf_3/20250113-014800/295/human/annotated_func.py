#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 \le n \le 10^5 and 1 \le a_i \le 10^9. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if a[i] < median + 1:
                operations += median + 1 - a[i]
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list of integers, each integer represents the number of increments required for each input array `a`, `median` is the median value of each sorted array `a`, `median_index` is the index of the median in each sorted array `a`, `operations` is the total number of increments calculated for each array `a`, `n` is the length of each array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `_` is the loop counter ranging from 0 to `t-1`.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers. For each array, it calculates the number of increments needed to ensure that no element in the array is less than the median of the array plus one. The median is determined after sorting the array. The function outputs the number of increments required for each array in a newline-separated format. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is taken to be the lower of the two middle elements. The function handles arrays of lengths up to 100,000 and ensures that all integers in the arrays are between 1 and 10^9. Potential edge cases include empty arrays or arrays with a single element, which would result in no increments being required.
