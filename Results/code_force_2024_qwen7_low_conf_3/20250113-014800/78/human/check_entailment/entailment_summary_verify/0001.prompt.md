You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an easy version of the problem; it differs from the hard version only
by the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values
are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.

Alice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n
\times m (2 \le n, m \le 10^9 ), the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to
bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell
at the intersection of row r and column c is denoted as (r, c ).

Bob has k (2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) fountains, all of them are located in
different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but
she must meet several conditions:

  * To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field. 
  * Alice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob. 
  * Alice will own the part that includes the cell (n, 1 ). 
  * Bob will own the part that includes the cell (1, m ). 

Alice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as
possible.

Bob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them
to Alice. First, output the integer \alpha — the maximum possible size of
Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will
remain on Bob's plot). Then output k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots,
a_k , where:

  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase (i.e., remains equal to \alpha ); 
  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases (i.e., becomes greater than \alpha ). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n, m \le 10^9 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the field sizes and the number of
fountains, respectively.

Then follow k lines, each containing two numbers r_i and c_i (1 \le r_i \le n
, 1 \le c_i \le m ) — the coordinates of the cell with the i -th fountain. It
is guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n, 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, first output \alpha — the maximum size of the plot that
can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output
k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , where:

  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob; 
  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob. 

If you output any other positive number instead of 1 that fits into a 64-bit
signed integer type, it will also be recognized as 1 . Thus, a solution to the
hard version of this problem will also pass the tests for the easy version.

The indices of the fountains are labeled in green. The cells belonging to
Alice are marked in blue.

Note that if Bob gives Alice fountain 1 or fountain 3 , then that fountain
cannot be on Alice's plot.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for z in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        c = []
        for i in range(k):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            c.append((y, x, i))
        c.sort()
        f = [(1, 0, 0)]
        s = 0
        answer = [0] * k
        for i in range(k):
            if c[i][1] > f[-1][1]:
                s += (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])
                f.append((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]))
        answer[f[-1][2]] = 1
        for i in range(1, len(f) - 1):
            if f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]:
                answer[f[i][2]] = 1
        print(s + (n - f[-1][1]) * m)
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specified ranges, and `k` pairs of integers representing fountain coordinates. The function then calculates and prints two outputs for each test case:
1. A sum `s` which is the result of the expression \((c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) for all `i` where \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\).
2. A list `answer` of length `k` where each element is 1 if the corresponding fountain index satisfies certain conditions, and 0 otherwise.
Specifically, the function sorts the fountain coordinates by the first element, iterates through them to calculate `s`, and updates the `answer` list based on the relative positions of the fountains. After processing all test cases, the function prints the total sum `s` plus the product of `n - f[-1][1]` and `m`, followed by the `answer` list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the field (`n`, `m`) and the number of fountains (`k`).
3. It then reads the coordinates of the fountains and stores them in a list `c` along with their original index.
4. The list `c` is sorted based on the x-coordinate (`y` in the code), which means fountains are ordered from left to right.
5. A list `f` is initialized with the starting point `(1, 0)` representing the top boundary of the field.
6. As it iterates through the sorted list of fountains, it calculates the area Alice can own without considering any fountain given to her.
   - If the current fountain is to the right of the last added fountain in `f`, it adds the area between these points to `s`.
7. After processing all fountains, it sets `answer[f[-1][2]] = 1` to indicate that giving the last fountain to Alice increases the area she can own.
8. Then it checks if giving any of the intermediate fountains to Alice would increase the area she can own.
9. Finally, it prints the total area Alice can own if no fountains are given to her and the answers for each fountain.

Given the description, the logic of the program seems to match the problem statement:
- It correctly calculates the area Alice can own initially.
- It correctly identifies which fountains, when given to Alice, would increase her area.

However, there are a few potential issues:
1. The sorting step ensures that fountains are processed from left to right, which is correct.
2. The area calculation might not fully account for the conditions where fountains could influence the boundary paths.
3. The logic to check which fountains, when given to Alice, increase her area is not fully implemented as described in the problem statement.

After careful analysis, the program appears to handle the main logic correctly, but the handling of the conditions for increasing the area might need further refinement. Given the complexity and the assumptions made, the program generally follows the required steps.
