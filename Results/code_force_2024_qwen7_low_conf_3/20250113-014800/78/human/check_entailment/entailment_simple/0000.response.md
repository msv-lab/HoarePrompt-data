Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Output Format for the Easy Version**:
   - The problem description states that the output should include the maximum possible size of Alice's plot (`\alpha`) followed by `k` non-negative integers indicating whether giving each fountain to Alice would increase the size of her plot.
   - The annotated program does not correctly compute and output these values.

2. **Computation of \(\alpha\)**:
   - The annotated program computes a value `s` which is the sum of areas under certain conditions, but it does not correctly determine the maximum possible size of Alice's plot (`\alpha`). The value `s` does not represent the optimal division of the field according to the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the logic for determining `\alpha` should consider the optimal path for Alice to maximize the number of cells she can own, including the impact of placing each fountain either with Alice or Bob.

3. **Output of `answer` Array**:
   - The `answer` array is initialized with zeros and modified based on certain conditions, but it does not correctly reflect whether giving each fountain to Alice would increase her plot size. The conditions used in the code do not align with the problem's requirements for determining which fountains should result in an increased plot size for Alice.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Compute the initial size of Alice's plot (`\alpha`) considering the field and the fountains.
- For each fountain, determine if giving it to Alice would increase her plot size by considering the impact of the fountain on the optimal path for Alice.
- Output the correct values for `\alpha` and the `k` non-negative integers indicating whether giving each fountain to Alice would increase her plot size.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
