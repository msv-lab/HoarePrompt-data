t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there are k pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) such that 1 <= r_i <= n and 1 <= c_i <= m, representing the coordinates of the fountains, and all these coordinates are distinct and none of them is (n, 1).
