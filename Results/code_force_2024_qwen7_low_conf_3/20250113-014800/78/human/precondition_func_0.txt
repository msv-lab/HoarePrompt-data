t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of n, m, and k, where 2 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. There are k pairs of integers r_i and c_i, where 1 <= r_i <= n and 1 <= c_i <= m, representing the coordinates of fountains. All fountains have distinct positions, and no fountain is at (n, 1).
