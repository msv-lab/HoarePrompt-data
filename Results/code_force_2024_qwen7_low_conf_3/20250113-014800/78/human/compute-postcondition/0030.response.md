Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `x` is the integer read as the first input, `y` is the integer read as the second input, `i` is \( j + 2 \), `f` is a list containing the tuples \([1, 0, 0]\) and \((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])\), `s` is updated by adding \((c[i][0] - 1) * c[i][1]\) to its current value if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged, and `answer` is a list of \( k \) zeros.**
