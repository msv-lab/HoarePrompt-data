Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Analysis

#### Initial State:
- `answer` is a list of `k` zeros.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `k`.
- `c` is a sorted list of `k` tuples based on the first element of each tuple.
- `f` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, 0)`.
- `s` is `0`.

#### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(k):
    if c[i][1] > f[-1][1]:
        s += (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])
        f.append((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]))
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts at `k`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `k-1`.
   - `f` initially contains `(1, 0, 0)`.

2. **First Iteration (i=0)**:
   - Check `if c[0][1] > f[-1][1]`.
   - If true, append `(c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2])` to `f` and update `s`.
   - `f` becomes `[1, 0, 0], (c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2])`.

3. **Second Iteration (i=1)**:
   - Check `if c[1][1] > f[-1][1]`.
   - If true, append `(c[1][0], c[1][1], c[1][2])` to `f` and update `s`.
   - `f` becomes `[1, 0, 0], (c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2]), (c[1][0], c[1][1], c[1][2])`.

4. **General Iteration (i=n)**:
   - Continue appending tuples from `c` to `f` if the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is met.
   - `s` accumulates the value `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for each iteration where the condition is true.

5. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `f` will contain all tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true.
   - `s` will be the sum of the contributions from those tuples.

### Final Output State:

- `answer` remains a list of `k` zeros because the loop does not modify `answer`.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `-1` after the loop finishes (since the loop increments `i` from `k` to `k-1`).
- `c` remains the same as the initial list.
- `f` contains all tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true.
- `s` is the accumulated sum of the contributions from those tuples.

### Output State:
Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `-1`, `c` is a sorted list of `k` tuples based on the first element of each tuple, `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples.**
