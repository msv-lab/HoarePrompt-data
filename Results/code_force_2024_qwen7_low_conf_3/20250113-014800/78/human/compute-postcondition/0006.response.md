The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value directly. However, the code does affect the list `c` by adding a new tuple to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` is a list containing one additional tuple `(y, x, i)`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
