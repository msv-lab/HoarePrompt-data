The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This impacts the following variables:

- `x` is assigned the first integer input.
- `y` is assigned the second integer input.
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Since `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `i` retain their previous states, and `x` and `y` are assigned new values, the updated states are as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is now one more than its previous value (since we are starting the next iteration), `c` is a list containing one additional tuple `(y, x, i)`, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `i` is now set to `k`.**
