Postcondition: ***`answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k`, `c` is a sorted list of `k` tuples based on the first element of each tuple, `f` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)`, `(c[k-1][0], c[k-1][1], c[k-1][2])`, and `c[k]`, `s` is unchanged.***

Explanation:
- Since there is no else part in the code, the overall postcondition is simply the postcondition of the if part.
- According to the if part, the tuple `c[k]` (the (k+1)th tuple in the list `c`) is appended to `f`.
- Therefore, the final state of the program includes `answer` as a list of `k` zeros, `n` as an input integer, `m` as an input integer, `k` as a positive integer, `i` as `k`, `c` as a sorted list of `k` tuples based on the first element of each tuple, `f` as a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)`, `(c[k-1][0], c[k-1][1], c[k-1][2])`, and `c[k]`, and `s` remains unchanged.
