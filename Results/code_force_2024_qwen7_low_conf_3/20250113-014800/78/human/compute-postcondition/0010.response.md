According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\),
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input,
- `m` is an integer obtained from the input,
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is now one more than its previous value,
- `c` is a list containing one additional tuple \((y, x, i)\) where \(y\) is `m`, \(x\) is `n`, and \(i\) is `k`,
- `x` is the first integer input,
- `y` is the second integer input.

Since `k` is one more than its previous value, `k` has incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k+1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` remains the same,
- `n` remains the same,
- `m` remains the same,
- `k` is now one more than its previous value (let's call it `k_prev`), so `k = k_prev + 1`,
- `c` contains one additional tuple \((m, n, k)\),
- `x` is the first integer input,
- `y` is the second integer input.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k+1`, meaning `i` starts from 0 and needs to be less than `k+1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is now one more than its previous value, `c` is a list containing one additional tuple \((m, n, k)\), `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `i` must be less than `k+1`**.
