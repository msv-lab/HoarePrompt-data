Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a list of `k` tuples sorted by the first element, `n` is the last new input integer, `m` is the last new input integer, `k` is the last new input integer, `x` is the last first integer input, `y` is the last second integer input, `s` is the accumulated sum of \((c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) for all `i` where \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), `f` is a list of at least 3 tuples that satisfy the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), and `answer` is a list of `k` zeros with elements at indices `f[-1][2]` and `f[i][2]` set to `1`, and the current value of `f[i][0]` is less than the current value of `f[i + 1][0]`. The element at index `f[i][2]` in `answer` is now set to `1`. If the condition `f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]` is true, no further changes occur.***
