`c.append((y, x, i))` appends a tuple \((y, x, i)\) to the list `c`. The values of `x` and `y` are taken from the inputs, and `i` is checked to be less than `k+1`. Since `k` was previously one more than its previous value, `k` is now `k+1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input
- `m` is an integer obtained from the input
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is now one more than its previous value
- `c` is a list containing one additional tuple \((m, n, k)\) and also contains the new tuple \((y, x, i)\)
- `x` is the integer read as the first input
- `y` is the integer read as the second input
- `i` is an integer that is less than `k+1`

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is now one more than its previous value, `c` is a list containing one additional tuple \((m, n, k)\) and also contains the new tuple \((y, x, i)\), `x` is the integer read as the first input, `y` is the integer read as the second input, `i` is an integer that is less than `k+1`**
