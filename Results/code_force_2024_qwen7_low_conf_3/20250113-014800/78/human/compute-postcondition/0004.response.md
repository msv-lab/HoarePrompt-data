According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know the following:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `c` is an empty list.

The critical point is that the loop will only execute if `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` is an empty list, and `k` must be greater than 0.**
