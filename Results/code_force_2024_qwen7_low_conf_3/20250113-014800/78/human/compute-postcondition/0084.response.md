Postcondition: ***`answer` is a list of `k` zeros except for the elements at indices `f[-1][2]` and `f[len(f)-1][2]` which are both 1; `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is true; `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples; `i` is `len(f) - 1`.***
