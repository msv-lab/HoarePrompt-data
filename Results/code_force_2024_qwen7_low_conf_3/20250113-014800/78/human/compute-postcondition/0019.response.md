Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `x` is the integer read as the first input, `y` is the integer read as the second input, `i` is 0, `f` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, 0)`, `s` is 0, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, and the current value of `c[i][1]` is greater than the last element of `f` in terms of its second element**
