State before the loop starts: `answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an empty list.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The for loop is defined as `for i in range(k):`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 because the loop will not run if `k` is 0 (as `range(0)` generates no numbers).
3. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k-1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states such that `k` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0.

Therefore, the required states to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `i` must be 0

State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an empty list**
