Postcondition: ***`answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is a sorted list of `k` tuples based on the first element of each tuple, `f` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)`, `(c[k-1][0], c[k-1][1], c[k-1][2])`, and `c[k]`, and `f` now includes the tuple `c[k-1]` if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`. Otherwise, `f` remains unchanged.***
