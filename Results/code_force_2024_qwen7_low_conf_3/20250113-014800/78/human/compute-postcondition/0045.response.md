The `print(*answer)` statement prints the elements of the list `answer`. Since the list `answer` contains `k` ones, the print statement will output `1` repeated `k` times. The values of the other variables and the list `answer` itself are not altered by this print statement.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, and the print statement outputs `1` repeated `k` times.**
