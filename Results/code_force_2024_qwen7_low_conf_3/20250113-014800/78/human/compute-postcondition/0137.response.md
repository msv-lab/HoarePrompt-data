The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will receive its inputs through some external means (such as from standard input or a predefined list), given the constraints provided. The function is expected to process a series of test cases, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i`.

Case_1: The function processes a set of test cases where `t` (the number of test cases) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, the function receives `n`, `m`, and `k`, where \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \times 10^5\). It also receives `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where \(1 \leq r_i \leq n\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq m\), representing the coordinates of fountains. The function should handle all these inputs and produce a result for each test case.

Since the specific output for each test case is not detailed, we can only state that the function processes the test cases as described and returns the appropriate results based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, it accepts `n`, `m`, and `k` as integers with specified ranges, and `k` pairs of integers representing fountain coordinates. The function returns the results for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
