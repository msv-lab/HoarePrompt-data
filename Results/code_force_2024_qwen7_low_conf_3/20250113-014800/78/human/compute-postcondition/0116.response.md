Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `c` is a list of `k` tuples sorted by the first element, `n` is the last new input integer, `m` is the last new input integer, `k` is the last new input integer, `x` is the last first integer input, `y` is the last second integer input, `s` is `(c[1][0] - 1) * (c[1][1] - f[-1][1])`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `f` is `[c[1]]`. If `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, then `s` is updated to `(c[1][0] - 1) * (c[1][1] - f[-1][1])`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s`.***
