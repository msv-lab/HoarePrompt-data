Postcondition: ***`answer` is a list of `k` zeros except for the elements at indices `f[-1][2]`, `f[len(f)-1][2]`, and `f[i][2]` which are all 1; `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is true; `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples; `i` is `i + 1` if `f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.***
