`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The input is taken in the form of two space-separated integers. Other variables such as `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is a list containing the tuple (`y`, `x`, 0), `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
