`c` is a list containing the tuple `(y, x, i)`. The code appends a new tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. The values of `y`, `x`, and `i` are already defined, and the list `c` now includes this new tuple. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`len(f)` is at least 2, `len(f) - 1` must be less than `k`, `i` is `len(f) - 1`, `c` is a list containing the tuples `(y, x, i)` and `(y, x, i)` (appended), `n` is a new input integer, `m` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input.**
