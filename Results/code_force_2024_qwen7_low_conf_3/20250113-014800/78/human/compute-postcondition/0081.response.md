Postcondition: ***`answer` is a list of k zeros except for the element at index `f[-1][2]` which is 1. `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is true. `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples. If the current value of `f[i][0]` is less than `f[i + 1][0]`, then `answer[f[i][2]]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
