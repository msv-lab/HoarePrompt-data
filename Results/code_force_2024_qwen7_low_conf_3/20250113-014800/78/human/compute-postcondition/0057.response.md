`c` is a list containing the tuple (`y`, `x`, 0) and the tuple (`y`, `x`, 1). The code appends a new tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. Since `i` is initially 2, the new tuple added to `c` is `(y, x, 2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a list containing the tuple (`y`, `x`, 0), the tuple (`y`, `x`, 1), and the tuple (`y`, `x`, 2).

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a list containing the tuple (`y`, `x`, 0), the tuple (`y`, `x`, 1), and the tuple (`y`, `x`, 2)**.
