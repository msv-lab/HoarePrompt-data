The code initializes an empty list `c`. This means that the lists `answer` and `m` remain unchanged, while `c` is now an empty list. The values of `n`, `k`, and `answer` are preserved from the initial state.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an empty list**
