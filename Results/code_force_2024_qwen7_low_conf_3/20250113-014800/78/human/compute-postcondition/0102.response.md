The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a tuple containing the values of `y`, `x`, and `i` to the list `c`. The initial values of the variables are as follows:
- `len(f) - 1 < k`
- `i` is `len(f)`
- `c` contains the tuple `(previous_y, previous_x, i)` and `(previous_y, previous_x, i)`
- `n` is a new input integer
- `m` is a new input integer
- `k` is a new input integer
- `x` is the first integer input
- `y` is the second integer input

After executing the code, the list `c` will have one additional tuple appended to it. The new tuple will be `(y, x, i)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(f) - 1 < k`, `i` is `len(f)`, `c` contains the tuples `(previous_y, previous_x, i)`, `(previous_y, previous_x, i)`, and `(y, x, i)`, `n` is a new input integer, `m` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input**
