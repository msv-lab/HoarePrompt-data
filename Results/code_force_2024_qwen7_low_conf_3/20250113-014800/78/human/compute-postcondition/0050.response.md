`x` and `y` are assigned the values of `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the user will input two integers, which will be converted to integers and assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. The other variables (`answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, and `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
