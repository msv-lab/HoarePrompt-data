Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `x` is the integer read as the first input, `y` is the integer read as the second input, `i` is \( j + 1 \), `f` is a list containing the tuples \([1, 0, 0]\) and \((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])\), `s` is \((c[i][0] - 1) * c[i][1] + (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\), `answer` is a list of \( k \) zeros. If `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, then `s` is updated to \((c[i][0] - 1) * c[i][1]\). Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
