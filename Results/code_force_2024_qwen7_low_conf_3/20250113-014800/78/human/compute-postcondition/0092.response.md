The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This affects the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, but does not affect the values of `answer`, `f`, `s`, `i`, or `z`.

Given the initial state:
- `answer` is a list of `k` zeros except for the elements at indices `f[0][2]`, `f[1][2]`, ..., `f[len(f) - 2][2]` which are all 1.
- `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is true.
- `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples.
- `i` is `len(f) - 2`.
- `z` is `z + 1`.
- The contents of `answer` are printed.

After the code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` is executed:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new values from the input, but their exact values are unknown.
- The values of `answer`, `f`, `s`, `i`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` zeros except for the elements at indices `f[0][2]`, `f[1][2]`, ..., `f[len(f) - 2][2]` which are all 1; `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is true; `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples; `i` is `len(f) - 2`; `z` is `z + 1` and has been incremented by 1; the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are new input integers.**
