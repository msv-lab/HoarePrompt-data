The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a new tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. Given the initial state:

- `answer` is a list of `k` ones
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `c` is a list containing the tuple `(y, x, 0)`
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer

After executing the code, the list `c` will have the new tuple `(y, x, i)` appended to it. Since `i` is initially 1, the new tuple will be `(y, x, 1)`. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is a list containing the tuple (`y`, `x`, 0) and the tuple (`y`, `x`, 1)**
