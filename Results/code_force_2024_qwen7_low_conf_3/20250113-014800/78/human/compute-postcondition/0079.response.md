Postcondition: ***`answer` is a list of k zeros except for the element at index `f[-1][2]` which is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `c` is a sorted list of k tuples based on the first element of each tuple, `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples, `f` has at least 2 elements, and the current value of `f[i][0]` is less than `f[i + 1][0]`***
