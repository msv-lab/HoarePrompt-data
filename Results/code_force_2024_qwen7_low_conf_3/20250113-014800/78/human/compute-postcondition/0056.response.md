The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means that the variables `x` and `y` will now hold these integers, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a list containing the tuple (`y`, `x`, 0) and the tuple (`y`, `x`, 1), `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
