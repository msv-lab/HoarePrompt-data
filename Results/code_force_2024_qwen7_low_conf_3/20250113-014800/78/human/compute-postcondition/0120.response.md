Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a list of `k` tuples sorted by the first element, `n` is the last new input integer, `m` is the last new input integer, `k` is the last new input integer, `x` is the last first integer input, `y` is the last second integer input, `s` is \((c[2][0] - 1) * (c[2][1] - c[1][1])\) or updated to \((c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) depending on the value of `c[i][1]`, `f` is \([c[1], (c[2][0], c[2][1], c[2][2])]\) or updated to \([c[1], c[2]]\) depending on the value of `c[2][1]`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else cases, ensuring that the state of the program variables is accurately described after the if-else block executes.
