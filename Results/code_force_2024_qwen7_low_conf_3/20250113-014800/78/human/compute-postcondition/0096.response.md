`c` is appended with the tuple `(y, x, i)`. The value of `i` is `len(f) - 2`, `y` is the second integer input, and `x` is the first integer input. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(f)` is at least 2, `len(f) - 2` must be less than `k`, `i` is `len(f) - 2`, `c` is a list containing the tuple `(y, x, i)`, `n` is a new input integer, `m` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer, `x` is the first integer input, and `y` is the second integer input.

Output State: **`len(f)` is at least 2, `len(f) - 2` must be less than `k`, `i` is `len(f) - 2`, `c` is a list containing the tuple `(y, x, i)`, `n` is a new input integer, `m` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer, `x` is the first integer input, and `y` is the second integer input.**
