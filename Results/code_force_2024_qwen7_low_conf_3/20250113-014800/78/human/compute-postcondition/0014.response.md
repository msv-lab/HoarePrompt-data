The code `c.sort()` sorts the list of tuples `c` in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state of `c` is a list of tuples \((y, x, i)\) where each tuple corresponds to the inputs \((y, x)\) and index \(i\) from each iteration of the loop, after sorting, `c` will be sorted based on the values of \(y\).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is the same as its value after the loop completes, `c` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `x` is the integer read as the first input, `y` is the integer read as the second input, `i` is an integer ranging from 0 to \(k-1\).**
