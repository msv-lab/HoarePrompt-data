Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is the same as its value after the loop completes, `c` is a list of tuples \((y, x, i)\) where each tuple corresponds to the inputs \((y, x)\) and index \(i\) from each iteration of the loop, `x` is the integer read as the first input, `y` is the integer read as the second input, `i` is an integer ranging from 0 to \(k-1\).**
