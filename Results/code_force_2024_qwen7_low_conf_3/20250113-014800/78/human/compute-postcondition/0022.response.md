Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `x` is the integer read as the first input, `y` is the integer read as the second input, `i` is 0, `f` is a list containing the tuples `[1, 0, 0]` and `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`, `s` is `(c[i][0] - 1) * c[i][1]`, and `answer` is a list of `k` zeros. If `c[i][1]` is greater than the second element of the last tuple in `f`, then `f` is updated to contain the tuples `[1, 0, 0]` and `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`, and `s` is set to `(c[i][0] - 1) * c[i][1]`. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
