The code appends a tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. Initially, `i` is 0, `y` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer. The values of `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.

- `answer` is a list of `k` ones.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `i` is updated to 0 (it remains 0 as the code does not change its value).
- `c` is an empty list and now contains the tuple `(y, x, 0)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` is a list containing the tuple (`y`, `x`, 0)**
