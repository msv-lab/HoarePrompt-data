Postcondition: **`answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is a sorted list of `k` tuples based on the first element of each tuple, `f` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, 0)`, `s` is `0`. The current value of `c[i][1]` is greater than `f[-1][1]`**
