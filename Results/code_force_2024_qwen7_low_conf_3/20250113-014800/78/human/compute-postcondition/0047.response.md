The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state is that `answer` is a list of `k` ones, and the print statement outputs `1` repeated `k` times. After executing this code, the variables `answer`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated.

- `answer` remains a list of `k` ones.
- `n` and `m` are assigned the values entered by the user, converted to integers.
- `k` is also assigned the value entered by the user, converted to an integer.

Since the initial value of `answer` is not directly used in the code, its state remains unchanged except for being initialized to a list of `k` ones. The other variables are updated according to the input.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
