Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `c` is a list of `k` tuples sorted by the first element, `n` is the last new input integer, `m` is the last new input integer, `k` is the last new input integer, `x` is the last first integer input, `y` is the last second integer input, `s` is the accumulated sum of \((c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) for all `i` where \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), `f` is a list of at least 3 tuples that satisfy the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), and the element at index `f[i][2]` in `answer` is now set to `1`. If `f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the element at index `f[i][2]` in `answer` remains set to `1`.***
