Postcondition: ***`answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is a sorted list of `k` tuples based on the first element of each tuple, `f` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[k-1][0], c[k-1][1], c[k-1][2])`. If `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, no changes are made. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
