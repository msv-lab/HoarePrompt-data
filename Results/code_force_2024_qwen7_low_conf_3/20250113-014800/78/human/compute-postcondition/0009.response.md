The code appends a tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. The values of `y`, `x`, and `i` are taken from the inputs `m`, `n`, and `k`, respectively. The value of `k` is increased by 1 since it is stated that `k` is now one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is now one more than its previous value, `c` is a list containing one additional tuple `(y, x, i)` where `y` is `m`, `x` is `n`, and `i` is `k`, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input.**
