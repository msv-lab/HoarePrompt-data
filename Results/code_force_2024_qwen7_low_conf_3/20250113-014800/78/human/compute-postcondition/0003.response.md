The code initializes an empty list `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them in this snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `c` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `c` is an empty list**
