The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means `x` and `y` will now hold the integer values read from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input
- `m` is an integer obtained from the input
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is now one more than its previous value
- `c` is a list containing one additional tuple \((m, n, k)\)
- `x` is the first integer input (before the code was run)
- `y` is the second integer input (before the code was run)
- `i` must be less than `k+1`

After running the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to the integers read from the input, while the other variables remain in their previous state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `k` is an integer obtained from the input and is now one more than its previous value, `c` is a list containing one additional tuple \((m, n, k)\), `x` is the integer read as the first input, `y` is the integer read as the second input, `i` must be less than `k+1`**
