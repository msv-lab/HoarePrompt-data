Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is a list of `k` tuples sorted by the first element, `n` is the last new input integer, `m` is the last new input integer, `k` is the last new input integer, `x` is the last first integer input, `y` is the last second integer input, `s` is 0, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros. If `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, then `total` is `(c[0][0] - 1) * (c[0][1] - f[-1][1])`, `f` is `[c[0]]` appended with the tuple from `c[i]`. Otherwise, no change to these variables.**
