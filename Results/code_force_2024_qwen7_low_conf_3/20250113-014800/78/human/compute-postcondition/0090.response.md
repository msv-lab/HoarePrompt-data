The code `print(*answer)` simply prints the contents of the `answer` list without changing its contents. Therefore, the only change is in the output, which will print the current state of the `answer` list.

From the initial state, we know that:
- `answer` is a list of `k` zeros except for the elements at indices `f[0][2]`, `f[1][2]`, ..., `f[len(f) - 2][2]` which are all 1.
- `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is true.
- `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples.
- `i` is `len(f) - 2`.

The code does not affect the values of `s`, `i`, or `f`. It also does not change the value of `answer`. The only thing it does is print the current state of `answer`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` zeros except for the elements at indices `f[0][2]`, `f[1][2]`, ..., `f[len(f) - 2][2]` which are all 1; `f` is a list of tuples from `c` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is true; `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all such tuples; `i` is `len(f) - 2`; and the contents of `answer` are printed.**
