`f` is appended with the tuple `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`. Given that `i` is `k - 1`, `c[i]` refers to the last element in the list `c`, which is a tuple based on its structure. The list `f` now contains the original tuple `(1, 0, 0)` and the new tuple `(c[k-1][0], c[k-1][1], c[k-1][2])`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is a sorted list of `k` tuples based on the first element of each tuple, `f` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[k-1][0], c[k-1][1], c[k-1][2])`.**
