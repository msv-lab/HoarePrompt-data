According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` meets this condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4** 

This ensures that the loop will execute as required.
