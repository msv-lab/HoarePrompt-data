According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop runs for each value in the range `range(t)`. At the end of the last iteration, `answer` is a list of `k` ones, and the print statement outputs `1` repeated `k` times. This means that the loop has completed its execution for all values from `0` to `t-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the current value it is at. Since the loop has just completed its execution, `t` must be at least `k` (because `k` is the number of times the loop has already run).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `k+1` to allow the loop to run an additional time.

State: **`answer` is a list of `k` ones, and the print statement outputs `1` repeated `k` times, `t` must be greater than `k`**
