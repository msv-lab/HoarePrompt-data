The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and splits them into two separate variables `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will include the updated values of `x` and `y`, and keep the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.
