The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( r_i \), and \( c_i \). For each test case, it calculates and stores the product of the first \( m \) natural numbers (where \( m \) is the minimum between the number of unique row indices and the number of unique column indices) modulo \( MOD \). After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each test case. If no unique row or column indices are provided, the function still processes the test case correctly by considering the full range of possible indices. Edge cases such as when all rows or columns are identical, leading to zero unique indices, are handled appropriately by ensuring the product calculation considers the remaining indices.
