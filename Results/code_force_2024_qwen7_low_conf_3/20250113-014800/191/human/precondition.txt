t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each move you made are valid, meaning they do not place a rook in the same row or column as any previously placed rook, and the computer's mirrored moves are also valid.
