The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. The value of `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. Other variables such as `k`, `c`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the original value of `index` + 2; `rows` contains the value `r`**
