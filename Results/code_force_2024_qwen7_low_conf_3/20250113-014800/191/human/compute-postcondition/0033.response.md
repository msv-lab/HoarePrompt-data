The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `c` by converting `data[index + 1]` to an integer. Given that `index` is 9, `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[10]`. The initial state does not provide the exact value of `data[10]`, but since it's part of a list of strings, it will be converted to an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 9, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 9, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, `r` is `int(data[9])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
