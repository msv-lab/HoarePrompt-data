The code snippet `r = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `r`. However, the initial values of `data` and `index` are not specified. Therefore, we can only state that `r` is now an integer value from `data[index]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged**
