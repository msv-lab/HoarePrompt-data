`rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. The value of `r` is an integer from `data[index]`, and `rows` is a set that did not contain `r` before this operation. The value of `index` is increased by 2, but the value of `data` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer value from `data[index - 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `data` and `rows` contain `r`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer value from `data[index - 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `rows` contains `r`**
