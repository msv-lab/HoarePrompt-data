`m` is assigned the value of `min(free_rows, free_cols)`. The value of `free_rows` and `free_cols` is not specified in the initial state, but they are derived from the conditions given. The value of `free_cols` is calculated as `n - len(cols)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `2 * k + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)`.
