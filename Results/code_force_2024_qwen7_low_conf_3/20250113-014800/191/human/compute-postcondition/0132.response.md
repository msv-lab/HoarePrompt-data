`cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Initially, `cols` contains the values `r` and `c`. After adding `r` to `cols`, the set `cols` will contain the values `r` and `c`, with `r` being added only once since sets do not allow duplicate values.

The value of `index` is updated to `index + 2`, but the initial value of `index` is not provided, so we can only say that `index` is now `index + 2`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer value from `data[index - 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `cols` contains `r` and `c`**
