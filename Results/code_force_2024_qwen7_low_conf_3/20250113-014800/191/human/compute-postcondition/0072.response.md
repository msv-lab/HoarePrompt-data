The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The initial state shows that `index` was already set to `index + 2`. After executing this line, `index` will be incremented by 2 again. Therefore, the new value of `index` will be `(index + 2) + 2`, which simplifies to `index + 4`.

The other variables (`k`, `r`, `c`, `rows`, and `cols`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 4`; `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`.**
