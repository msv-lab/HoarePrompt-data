The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. Since `rows` is initially a set containing `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`, adding `r` to this set does not change its contents because sets do not allow duplicate values. Therefore, the set `rows` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 9, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 11, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, `r` is `int(data[9])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**.
