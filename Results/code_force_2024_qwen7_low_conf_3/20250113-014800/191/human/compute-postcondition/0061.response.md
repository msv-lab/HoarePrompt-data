The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `data[index + 1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `c`, but we know it is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

The conditions of the initial state remain valid, so `k` is still greater than 0, and `r` is still the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
