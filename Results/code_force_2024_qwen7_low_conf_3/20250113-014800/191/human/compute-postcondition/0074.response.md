The code `cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Since sets do not allow duplicate values, adding `c` to `cols` will not change the set if `c` is already present. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 4`; `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` if `c` is not already in `cols`.**
