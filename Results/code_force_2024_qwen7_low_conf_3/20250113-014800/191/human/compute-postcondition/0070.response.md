The code `r = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `r`. Since `r` was previously the integer value of `data[index]`, it remains unchanged. However, the current line of code does not change `r` but reassigns it, so the new value of `r` will be the integer value of `data[index]`.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is greater than 1
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is now `index + 2`
- `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`
- `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`

After executing the code `r = int(data[index])`, the value of `r` remains the integer value of `data[index]`. All other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 2`; `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`.**
