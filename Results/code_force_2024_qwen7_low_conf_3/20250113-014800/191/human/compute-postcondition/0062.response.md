The value of `index` is incremented by 2, so the new value of `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2. The values of `k` and `r` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the original value of `index` + 2.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the original value of `index` + 2**
