The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i` remain unchanged in their preconditions. Therefore, the only variable affected is `data`, which is now a list of strings obtained from the split input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the values of `r_i` and `c_i` for each of the k lines are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
