Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, m + 1):` will execute as long as `i` is between 1 and `m` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the loop, the variable `i` starts from 1.

3. **Determine the value of `m`**: `m` is defined as the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`. Therefore, `m` is determined by the values of `free_rows` and `free_cols`.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. This means both `free_rows` and `free_cols` should be positive integers.

5. **List the required states**: Based on the above analysis, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `result` is 1, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `t` is 0, `k` is the total number of iterations performed, `index` is `data.index + 2 + 2 * k`, `rows` is a set containing all unique `r` values encountered, `cols` is a set containing all unique `c` values encountered, `r` is the last `r` value added to `rows`, `c` is the last `c` value added to `cols`, and `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1.**

The final answer is:
State: **`m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `result` is 1, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `t` is 0, `k` is the total number of iterations performed, `index` is `data.index + 2 + 2 * k`, `rows` is a set containing all unique `r` values encountered, `cols` is a set containing all unique `c` values encountered, `r` is the last `r` value added to `rows`, `c` is the last `c` value added to `cols`, and `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1.**
