Postcondition: **`m` is at least 1, `free_rows` or `free_cols` (or both) is at least 1, `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `t` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `index` is `(data.index + 2) + 2`, `rows` is a set containing the element `r`, `cols` is a set containing the element `data[(data.index + 2) + 1]`, `r` is `data[data.index + 2]`. The condition `r` is not equal to `c` holds true.**
