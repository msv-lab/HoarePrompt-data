`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. The value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 2`. All other variables (`k`, `r`, `rows`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 2`; `rows` contains the value `r`; `cols` is a set containing `c`.**
