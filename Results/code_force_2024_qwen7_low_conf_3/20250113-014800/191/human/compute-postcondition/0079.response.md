The code snippet `r = int(data[index])` updates the value of `r` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. Given the initial state, `r` was previously the integer value of `data[index]`. Now, it is reassigned to the integer value of `data[index]`, which does not change its value.

The other variables (`k`, `c`, `index`, `rows`, and `cols`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 4`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`); `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`).**
