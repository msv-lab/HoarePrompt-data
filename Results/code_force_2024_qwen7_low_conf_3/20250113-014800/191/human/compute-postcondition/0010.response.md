The code initializes an empty set named `rows`. This does not change the values of the existing variables but creates a new set object. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `data`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is an empty set**.
