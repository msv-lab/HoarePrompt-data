The code initializes the variable `cols` as an empty set. This means that the set `cols` is now empty, and no other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `2 * k + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)` and must be at least 1, `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)` and must be at least 1, `result` is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`**
