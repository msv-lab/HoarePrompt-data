The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `index`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `data` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the values of `r_i` and `c_i` for each of the k lines are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `index` is 0.**
