The code adds `r` to the set `cols`. Since `r` is `int(data[6])`, the set `cols` will now contain `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 8, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, `r` is `int(data[6])`, `c` is `int(data[7])`**
