According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is the next element in the list, and the next element in `results` was printed.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. Since `results` is a non-empty list, it will always have at least one element.
2. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `results`.
3. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is the next element in the list, meaning `results` still has at least one more element to iterate over.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `results` (which will be assigned to `res`) needs to be set, and the action of printing the next element in `results` will occur.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `res` is the next element in the list, the next element in `results` is printed**
