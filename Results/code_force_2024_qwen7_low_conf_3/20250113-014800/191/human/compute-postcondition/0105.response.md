The code `cols = set()` creates a new empty set named `cols`. This does not affect the values of `free_rows`, `free_cols`, `result`, `results`, `n`, `t`, `k`, `index`, or `rows`. 

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, either `free_rows` or `free_cols` (or both) is at least 1, `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `t` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `data.index + 2`, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set.**
