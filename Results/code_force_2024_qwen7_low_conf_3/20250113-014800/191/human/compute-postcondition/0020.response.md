The code adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Given that `r` is the integer value of `data[3]`, the set `cols` will now contain both `c` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, obtained from `int(data[1])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c` and `r`, `r` is the integer value of `data[3]` and is not equal to `c`.**
