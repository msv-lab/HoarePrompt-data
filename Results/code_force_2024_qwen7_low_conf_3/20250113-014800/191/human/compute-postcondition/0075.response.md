The code adds `c` to the set `rows`. Since `rows` was initially a set containing `r` and `c`, adding `c` again does not change the set because `c` is already in the set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 4`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c`; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` if `c` is not already in `cols`.**
