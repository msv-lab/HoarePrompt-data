The value of `index` is incremented by 2. Initially, `index` is 6, so after the increment, `index` becomes 8. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 8, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c` and `r`, `r` is `int(data[6])`, `c` is `int(data[7])`**
