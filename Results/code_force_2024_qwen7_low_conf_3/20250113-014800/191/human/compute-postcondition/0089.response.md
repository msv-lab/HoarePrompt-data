The code updates the value of `free_cols` to be `n - len(cols)`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, `rows`, `cols`, or `free_rows`. The only change is that `free_cols` is now assigned a new value based on the length of `cols`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `2 * k + 1 + 2 * k`, `rows` is a set containing all distinct row indices added during the loop iterations, `cols` is a set containing all distinct column indices added during the loop iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`**
