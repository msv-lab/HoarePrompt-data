The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. The value of `c` is `int(data[7])`, which means `rows` now contains `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 8, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`, `cols` is a set containing `c` and `r`, `r` is `int(data[6])`, `c` is `int(data[7])`**
