The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not perform any operations that change the values of the variables directly. It simply reassigns the `input` function to read the entire input from standard input at once, which is a preparation step for reading multiple test cases or large inputs efficiently. However, this assignment does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, or `c_i`.

Therefore, the only change is in how the input will be read subsequently. But since no specific input values are provided, the initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The values of `r_i` and `c_i` for each of the k lines are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The input method is now set to read the entire input from standard input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.**
