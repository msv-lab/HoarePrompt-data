According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:

- `m` is at least 1.
- Either `free_rows` or `free_cols` (or both) is at least 1.
- `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`.
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` should be decremented by 1.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` must be at least 1 (since it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, decrementing it by 1 will make it 0).

State: **`m` is at least 1, either `free_rows` or `free_cols` (or both) is at least 1, `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, and `t` is 0**.
