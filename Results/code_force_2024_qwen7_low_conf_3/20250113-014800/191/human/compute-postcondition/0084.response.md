The code adds `c` to the set `rows`. Since `c` is already in `cols`, adding it to `rows` does not change the content of `rows`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `k` is greater than 0.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`.
- `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2`.
- `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`), with `r` added.
- `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`), with `c` added if `c` was not in `cols`.

Since `rows.add(c)` does not affect `rows` because `c` is already present in `rows`, the only change is in the value of `index`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2 + 2`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`), `r` added; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`), `c` added if `c` was not in `cols`**.
