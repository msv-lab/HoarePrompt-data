`free_rows` is assigned the value of `n - len(rows)`. The length of `rows` is a count of all distinct row indices added during loop iterations. However, the exact value of `len(rows)` is not specified, and neither is the value of `n`. Therefore, `free_rows` will be calculated as `n` minus the number of distinct row indices in `rows`.

Other variables are not affected, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `2 * k + 1 + 2 * k`, `rows` is a set containing all distinct row indices added during the loop iterations, `cols` is a set containing all distinct column indices added during the loop iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`**
