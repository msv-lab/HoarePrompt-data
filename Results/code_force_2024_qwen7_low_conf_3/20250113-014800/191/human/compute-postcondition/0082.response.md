The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. Since sets cannot contain duplicate values, if `r` is already in `rows`, it will remain unchanged. However, if `r` is not in `rows`, it will be added.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is greater than 0
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`
- `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2`
- `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`)
- `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`)

After executing `rows.add(r)`:
- If `r` is not already in `rows`, `rows` will now contain `r` and `c`.
- If `r` is already in `rows`, `rows` remains unchanged.

The value of `r` and `c` and the expression for `index` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`), `r` added; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`).**
