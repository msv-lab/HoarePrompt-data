`c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 6, `c` will be `int(data[7])`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 6, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c` and `r`, `r` is `int(data[6])`, `c` is `int(data[7])`**
