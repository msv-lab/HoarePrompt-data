Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2 + 2`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`), `r` added; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`), `c` added if `c` was not in `cols`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then `index` is incremented by 2 additional steps.***
