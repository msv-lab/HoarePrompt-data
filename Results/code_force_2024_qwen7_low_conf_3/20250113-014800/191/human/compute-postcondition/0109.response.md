The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was `data.index + 2`, so the new value of `index` is now `(data.index + 2) + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `free_rows` or `free_cols` (or both) is at least 1, `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `t` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `index` is `(data.index + 2) + 2`, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set, `r` is `data[data.index + 2]`, `c` is `data[index + 1]`.**
