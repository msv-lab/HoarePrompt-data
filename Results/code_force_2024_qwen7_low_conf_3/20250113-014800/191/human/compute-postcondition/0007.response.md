The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. Since `index` is initially 1, this means `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. The variable `t` is not affected by this operation, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
