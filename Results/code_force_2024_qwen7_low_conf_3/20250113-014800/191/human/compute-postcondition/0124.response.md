Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1; `free_rows` or `free_cols` (or both) is at least 1; `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`; `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`; `n` is the value of `data[index]`; `t` is 0; `k` is at least 2; `index` is `(data.index + 2) + 4`; `rows` is a set containing the elements `r` and `c` or just `r`; `cols` is a set containing the elements `data[(data.index + 2) + 1]`, `r`, and `c`; `r` is `data[data.index + 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[data.index + 4]`.***

Explanation:
- The initial state includes the set `cols` containing `data[(data.index + 2) + 1]` and `r`, and the variable `c` being the integer value of `data[data.index + 4]`.
- After adding `c` to `cols`, the set `cols` now contains `data[(data.index + 2) + 1]`, `r`, and `c`.
- The if part checks if `r` is not equal to `c`. If true, the set `rows` is updated to contain both `r` and `c`, making it a set with two elements.
- Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition retains the state as described by the if part, meaning `rows` will be a set containing `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`. If `r` equals `c`, `rows` remains a set containing only `r`.
