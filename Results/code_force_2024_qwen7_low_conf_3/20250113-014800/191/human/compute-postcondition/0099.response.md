`results` is a list, and `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`. The code appends `result` to the `results` list. The values of `free_rows`, `free_cols`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `result` remains the same because it was not reassigned.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, either `free_rows` or `free_cols` (or both) is at least 1, `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, and `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`.**
