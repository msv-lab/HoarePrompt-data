The code `cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Since sets only contain unique elements, this operation does not change the set if `c` is already in `cols`. However, if `c` is not already in `cols`, it will be added.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is greater than 0
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`
- `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2`
- `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`), `r` added
- `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`)

After executing `cols.add(c)`:
- `cols` will have `c` added to it, if `c` was not already present in `cols`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`), `r` added; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`), `c` added if `c` was not in `cols`**
