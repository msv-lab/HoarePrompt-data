The code `print(res)` prints the value of `res`. Since `res` is the next element in the list `results`, the print statement will output the next element in the list. However, the value of `res` itself and the list `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `res` is the next element in the list, the next element in `results` is printed.**
