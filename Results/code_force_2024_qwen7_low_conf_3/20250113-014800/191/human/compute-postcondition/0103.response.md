`index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was `data.index`, so after the increment, `index` is now `data.index + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, either `free_rows` or `free_cols` (or both) is at least 1, `result` is the product of numbers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `t` is 0, and `k` is an integer equal to `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `data.index + 2`.**
