Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 1]`.
- `k` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 2]` and must be greater than 0.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `index` is `2 * k + 3`.
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`.
- `rows` is an empty set.
- `cols` is an empty set.
- `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)` and must be at least 1.
- `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)` and must be at least 1.
- `result` is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will execute `k` times. For the loop to execute, `k` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

### Adjusted States:
1. **Ensure `k` is greater than 0**: The initial state already specifies that `k` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 2]` and must be greater than 0. Therefore, no additional adjustment is needed for `k`.

2. **Loop Execution**: Since the loop runs `k` times, `k` must be a positive integer.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the only state that needs to be explicitly stated to ensure the loop executes is `k` being greater than 0, which is already given in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
