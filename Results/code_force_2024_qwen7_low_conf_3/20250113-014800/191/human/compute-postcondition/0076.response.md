The code `cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` initially contains `r` and `c`, adding `r` again does not change the set `cols` because sets do not allow duplicate elements. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 4`, and the values of `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, `rows`, and `cols` are affected accordingly.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 4`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c`; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` if `c` is not already in `cols` and `r` has been added.**
