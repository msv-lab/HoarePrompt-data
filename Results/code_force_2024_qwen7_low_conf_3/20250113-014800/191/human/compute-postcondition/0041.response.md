The code assigns the value `n - len(rows)` to `free_rows`. Given the initial state, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and `len(rows)` is the number of elements in the set `rows`. Since `rows` and `cols` are sets of integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`, their sizes do not directly affect the value of `free_rows`. Therefore, the value of `free_rows` is calculated as `n` minus the size of the `rows` set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `2 * k + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`**
