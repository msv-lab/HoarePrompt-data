The code `cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` is initially a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, adding `c` again does not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 9, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 11, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, `r` is `int(data[9])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
