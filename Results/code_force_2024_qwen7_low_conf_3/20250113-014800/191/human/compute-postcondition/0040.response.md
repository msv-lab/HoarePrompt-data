Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `2 * k + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations.**
