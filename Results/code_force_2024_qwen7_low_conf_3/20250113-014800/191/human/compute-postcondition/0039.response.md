Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 9, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 11, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, `r` is `int(data[9])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, the program continues to execute as specified in the if part; otherwise, no change is made to the sets `rows` and `cols` since the else part is not provided.***
