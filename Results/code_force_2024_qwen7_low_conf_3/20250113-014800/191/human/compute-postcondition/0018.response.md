Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, obtained from `int(data[1])`. `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`. `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0. `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. `index` is 5. `results` is an empty list. `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`. `cols` is a set containing `c`. `r` is the integer value of `data[3]` and is not equal to `c`.***

This postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and adds the condition specified in the if statement, ensuring that `r` is not equal to `c`.
