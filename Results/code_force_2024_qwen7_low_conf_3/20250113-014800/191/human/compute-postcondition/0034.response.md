The value of `index` is incremented by 2. Initially, `index` is 9, so after adding 2, `index` becomes 11. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 9, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 11, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, `r` is `int(data[9])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`.**
