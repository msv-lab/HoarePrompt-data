The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res`. Since `res` is the next element in the list `results`, the next element in `results` is printed. However, the value of `res` does not change, and neither does the list `results`.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `res` is the next element in the list, the next element in `results` is printed**
