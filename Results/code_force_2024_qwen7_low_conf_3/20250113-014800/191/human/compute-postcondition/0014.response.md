The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. Given the initial state, `index` is 3, so `data[index + 1]` corresponds to `data[4]`. The value of `c` will be the integer value of `data[4]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set, `r` is `int(data[3])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
