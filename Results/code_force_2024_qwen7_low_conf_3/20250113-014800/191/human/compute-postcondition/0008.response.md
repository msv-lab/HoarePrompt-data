The code `k = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `k` by converting the element at index `index + 1` of the `data` list into an integer. Given the initial state where `index` is 1, the element at `data[2]` (since `index + 1` is 2) will be converted to an integer and assigned to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
