The code snippet sets `r` to the integer value of `data[index]`. Given that `index` is 6, `r` is set to the integer value of `data[6]`. The value of `data[6]` is not specified in the initial state, so let's denote it as `data_6`. Thus, `r` is now `int(data_6)`. 

Other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 6, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c` and `r`, `r` is `int(data[6])`**
