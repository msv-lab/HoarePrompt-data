`t` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is a string that needs to be converted to an integer, which replaces the original value of `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[index])`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the values of `r_i` and `c_i` for each of the k lines are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `index` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[index])`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the values of `r_i` and `c_i` for each of the k lines are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `index` is 0.**
