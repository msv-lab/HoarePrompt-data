The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`. Given that `index` is `2 * k + 1`, the value of `n` is now the integer value of `data[2 * k + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `2 * k + 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`, `rows` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)` and must be at least 1, `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)` and must be at least 1, `result` is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`**
