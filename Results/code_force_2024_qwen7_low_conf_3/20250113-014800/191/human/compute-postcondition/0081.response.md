The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Since the initial value of `index` is `index + 4`, after executing this line, the new value of `index` will be `(index + 4) + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`); `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`).**
