Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer value from `data[index - 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `rows` contains either `r` or both `r` and `c`, and `cols` contains either `c` or both `r` and `c`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, both `rows` and `cols` contain both `r` and `c`.***
