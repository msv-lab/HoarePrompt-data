`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `k` must be greater than 0, and this condition remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
