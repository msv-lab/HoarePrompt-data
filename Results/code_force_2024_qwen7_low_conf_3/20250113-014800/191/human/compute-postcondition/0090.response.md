`m` is assigned the value of `min(free_rows, free_cols)`. The value of `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)` and the value of `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`. Since the lengths of `rows` and `cols` have not been specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `m`, but we know that `m` will take the minimum value between `free_rows` and `free_cols`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `2 * k + 1 + 2 * k`, `rows` is a set containing all distinct row indices added during the loop iterations, `cols` is a set containing all distinct column indices added during the loop iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)`**
