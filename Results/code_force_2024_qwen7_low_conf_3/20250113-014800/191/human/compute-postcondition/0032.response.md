The code updates the value of `r` to `int(data[index])`, where `index` is 9. Given the initial state, `index` is 9, and `data` is a list of strings. Therefore, `r` is updated to `int(data[9])`.

Since `r` is updated and the other variables are not affected, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 9, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 9, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `c`, and `r`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, `r` is `int(data[9])`, `c` is `int(data[7])`**
