The code `cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` is initially a set containing `c` and `r`, adding `c` again does not change the set because sets only contain unique elements. Therefore, the set `cols` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 8, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])` and `r`, `cols` is a set containing `c` and `r`, `r` is `int(data[6])`, `c` is `int(data[7])`**
