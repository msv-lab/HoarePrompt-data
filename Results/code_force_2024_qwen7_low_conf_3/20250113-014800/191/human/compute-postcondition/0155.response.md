The function `func_1` does not directly accept any parameters from the given constraints. Instead, it implies that the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes the following inputs:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n\). These represent the size of the problem instance and the number of specific lines to consider, respectively.
- For each of the `k` lines, `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\). These represent coordinates in a grid.

Given this information, the function likely processes these inputs for each test case and produces some form of output based on the provided data. However, since the specific output is not detailed in the problem statement, we focus on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a fixed number of test cases, each containing integers `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i` as described.**
