The line of code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Based on the initial state, `index` was `2 * k + 1`. After incrementing by 2, the new value of `index` becomes `(2 * k + 1) + 2`, which simplifies to `2 * k + 3`. 

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 1]`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 2]` and must be greater than 0
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`
- `rows` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`
- `cols` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations
- `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)` and must be at least 1
- `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)` and must be at least 1
- `result` is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `2 * k + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`, `rows` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)` and must be at least 1, `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)` and must be at least 1, `result` is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`**
