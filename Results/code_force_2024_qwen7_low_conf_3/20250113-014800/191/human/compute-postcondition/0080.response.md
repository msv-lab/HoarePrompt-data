The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `c` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Given that `index` was previously updated to `index + 4`, the new value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `index` is now `index + 4`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`); `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`).**
