Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is now `index + 2`, `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then the conditions remain as described. If `r` equals `c`, there is no additional change to the program state.***
