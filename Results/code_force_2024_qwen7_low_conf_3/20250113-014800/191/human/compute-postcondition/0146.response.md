`results.append(result)` appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`. After appending, `results` will now contain two elements: the original `result` and the newly appended `result`.

Output State: **`m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `result` is `m! % MOD`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are both `result`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `t` is 0, `k` is the total number of iterations performed, `index` is `data.index + 2 + 2 * k`, `rows` is a set containing all unique `r` values encountered, `cols` is a set containing all unique `c` values encountered, `r` is the last `r` value added to `rows`, `c` is the last `c` value added to `cols`.**
