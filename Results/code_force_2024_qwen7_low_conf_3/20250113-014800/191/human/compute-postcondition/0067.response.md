`cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Since `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`, and `cols` is a set containing the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, which is `c`, adding `r` to `cols` means `cols` now contains both `r` and `c`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is now `index + 2`, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`, and `r` is not equal to `c`**
