According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is not an empty list, and `res` has its original value.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element from the `results` list needs to be assigned to `res`.

Since the `results` list is not empty, there are more elements to iterate over. The next element in the list will be assigned to `res` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `res` is the next element in the list**
