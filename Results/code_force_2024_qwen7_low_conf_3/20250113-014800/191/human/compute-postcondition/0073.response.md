The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. Since `rows` initially contains the values `r` and `c`, adding `r` again does not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements. Therefore, the set `rows` remains unchanged.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `index` was updated to `index + 4`, but this change is not undone by the code in question.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 4`; `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`.**
