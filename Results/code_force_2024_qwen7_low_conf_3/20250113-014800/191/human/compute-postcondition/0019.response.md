The code adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. The previous value of `rows` was a set containing `int(data[3])`. After adding `c`, `rows` now contains both `int(data[3])` and `c`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, obtained from `int(data[1])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r` is the integer value of `data[3]` and is not equal to `c`.**
