`rows` is a set that adds the value `r` to it. Since `r` is `int(data[3])`, the set `rows` now contains the value `int(data[3])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `cols` is an empty set, `r` is `int(data[3])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `cols` is an empty set, `r` is `int(data[3])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
