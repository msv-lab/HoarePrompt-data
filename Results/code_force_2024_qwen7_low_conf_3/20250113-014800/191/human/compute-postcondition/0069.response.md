According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

- `k` is greater than 0
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is now `index + 2`
- `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`
- `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 1 (since it was already greater than 0 and we just went through one iteration).

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `k` is greater than 1.

State: **`k` is greater than 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is now `index + 2`, `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`.**
