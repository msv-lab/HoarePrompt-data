`rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the list `rows`. Since `c` is an integer value from `data[index - 1]`, adding `c` to `rows` means `rows` now contains `r` and `c`. The other variables (`r`, `c`, `index`, and `cols`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer value from `data[index - 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `cols` contains `c`**
