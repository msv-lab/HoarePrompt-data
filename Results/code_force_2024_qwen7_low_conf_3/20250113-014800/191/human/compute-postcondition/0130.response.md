`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. The value of `c` is an integer from `data[index - 1]`. The value of `r` remains unchanged and is still an integer from `data[index - 2]`. The value of `index` changes to `index + 2`. The value of `rows` is still a set containing `r`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer value from `data[index - 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `rows` contains `r`, `cols` contains `c`**
