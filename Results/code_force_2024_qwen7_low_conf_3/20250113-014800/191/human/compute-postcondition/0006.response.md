According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know that `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[index])`, and `index` is 1. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[index])`
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- `index` is 1
- `results` is an empty list

We need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
