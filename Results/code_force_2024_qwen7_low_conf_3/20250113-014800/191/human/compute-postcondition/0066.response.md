The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Since `rows` initially contains the value `r`, and `c` is added to it, the new state of `rows` will contain both `r` and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is now `index + 2`, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, and `r` is not equal to `c`**
