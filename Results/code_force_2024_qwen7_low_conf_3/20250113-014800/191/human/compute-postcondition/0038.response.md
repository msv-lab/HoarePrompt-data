The code `cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Given that `r` is equal to `int(data[9])`, the set `cols` now contains the elements `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 9, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 11, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r`, and `int(data[6])`, `r` is `int(data[9])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
