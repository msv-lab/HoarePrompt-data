The code `print(res)` prints the value of the variable `res`. However, the variable `res` is not affected by this line of code. It simply outputs the current value of `res`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `res`, it remains unchanged. The other information about the `results` list being not empty is also unaffected.

Output State: **`results` is not an empty list, `res` has its original value**
