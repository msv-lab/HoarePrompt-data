`index` is incremented by 2, which means its value changes, but the specific new value of `index` is not known since the initial value was not provided. However, the initial state also mentions that `data` and `index` are unchanged, implying their state remains the same before and after the code execution.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `data` and `index` are unchanged**
