The code updates the value of `c` to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Based on the initial state, `c` was the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. After executing the line `c = int(data[index + 1])`, the value of `c` remains the same because `int(data[index + 1])` returns the same value as `c` initially.

All other variables remain unchanged: `k` is still greater than 1, `r` is still the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is still `index + 2`, `rows` still contains the value `r` and `c`, and `cols` is still a set containing `r` and `c`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 2`; `rows` contains the value `r` and `c`; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c`.**
