`cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Since `r` is already a member of `rows` and `cols` from the initial state, adding `r` again to `cols` does not change the contents of `cols`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2 + 2`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`), `r` added; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`), `c` added if `c` was not in `cols`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`; `index` is now `(index + 4) + 2 + 2`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not already in `rows`), `r` added; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` (if `c` is not already in `cols`), `c` added if `c` was not in `cols`**
