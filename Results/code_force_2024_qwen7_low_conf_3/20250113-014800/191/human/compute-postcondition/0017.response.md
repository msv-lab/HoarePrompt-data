`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Since `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`, and `data[4]` was initially split from the input, its value hasn't changed. The set `cols` was initially empty, so now it contains the value of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[3])`, `cols` is a set containing `c`, `r` is `int(data[3])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
