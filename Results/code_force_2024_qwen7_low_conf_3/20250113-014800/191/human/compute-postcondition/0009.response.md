`index` is incremented by 2, so its new value is the original value of `index` (which was 1) plus 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list**
