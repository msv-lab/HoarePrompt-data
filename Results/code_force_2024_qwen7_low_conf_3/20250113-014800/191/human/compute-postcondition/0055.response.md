The code snippet `k = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `k`. Given that `index` is defined as `2 * k + 1`, we substitute `index` in the expression:

\[ k = int(data[2 * k + 1 + 1]) = int(data[2 * k + 2]) \]

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 1]`
- `k` is now the integer value of `data[2 * k + 2]` and must be greater than 0
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- `index` remains `2 * k + 1`
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`
- `rows` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`
- `cols` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations
- `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)` and must be at least 1
- `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)` and must be at least 1
- `result` is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 * k + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is `2 * k + 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`, `rows` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations where `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` is a set containing integers `r` and `c` from the loop iterations, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)` and must be at least 1, `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)` and must be at least 1, `result` is `(1 * (m * (m + 1)) // 2) % MOD`**
