`r` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. Given the initial state, `index` is 3, so `r` becomes `int(data[3])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set, `r` is `int(data[3])`**
