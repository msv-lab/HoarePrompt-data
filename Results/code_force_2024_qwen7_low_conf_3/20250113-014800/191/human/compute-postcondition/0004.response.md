The value of `index` is incremented by 1, and no other variables are affected by the given code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[index])`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the values of `r_i` and `c_i` for each of the k lines are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `index` is 1.**
