Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is now `index + 4`; `rows` is a set containing `r` and `c`; `cols` is a set containing `r` and `c` if `c` is not already in `cols`. Regardless of whether `r` equals `c`, `rows` and `cols` are updated accordingly to ensure they contain `r` and `c` as specified.***
