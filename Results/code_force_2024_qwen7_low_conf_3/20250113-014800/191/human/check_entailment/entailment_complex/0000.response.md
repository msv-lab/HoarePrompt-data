Reasoning:

1. The program reads the input data and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it maintains sets of unique row and column indices (`rows` and `cols`) based on the moves made.
3. If a move is not on the diagonal (i.e., `r != c`), it adds the corresponding mirrored positions to the sets.
4. It then calculates the number of free rows and columns (`free_rows` and `free_cols`).
5. The minimum number of free rows and columns (`m`) is determined.
6. The program computes the factorial of `m` modulo `10^9 + 7` and appends the result to the `results` list.
7. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This approach is correct because:
- The sets `rows` and `cols` effectively track all occupied rows and columns.
- The calculation of `free_rows` and `free_cols` accurately determines the available spaces.
- The minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` (`m`) correctly identifies the limiting factor for the number of additional rooks that can be placed.
- The computation of `result` as `m! % MOD` correctly represents the number of ways to place `m` additional rooks in the remaining spaces without violating the constraints.

The program logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly handles all described scenarios, including edge cases like when all rows or columns are identical.

Correctness: **True**
