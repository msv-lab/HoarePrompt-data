### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) initial valid moves (with mirroring).
   - The goal is to ensure no two rooks attack each other (i.e., no two rooks share the same row or column).

2. **Initial Moves Analysis**:
   - After the initial \( k \) moves, certain rows and columns become occupied.
   - The remaining rows and columns form "free" spaces where rooks can be placed without attacking the existing ones.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - Due to the symmetry of the problem, the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining free rows equals the number of ways to place them in the remaining columns.
   - The program correctly identifies the number of free rows and columns and calculates the minimum of these values, \( m \).

4. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The number of ways to place \( m \) rooks in \( m \) free positions is \( m! \).
   - The program correctly computes \( m! \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

5. **Program Verification**:
   - The program reads input correctly.
   - It calculates the number of free rows and columns.
   - It computes the minimum of the free rows and columns.
   - It computes the factorial of this minimum value modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - It outputs the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The indices are correctly managed to extract `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i`.

2. **Tracking Free Rows and Columns**:
   - The sets `rows` and `cols` are used to track the occupied rows and columns.
   - For each move, if \( r \neq c \), both \( r \) and \( c \) are added to the sets to account for the mirrored move.

3. **Calculating Free Spaces**:
   - `free_rows = n - len(rows)` and `free_cols = n - len(cols)` correctly calculate the number of free rows and columns.
   - `m = min(free_rows, free_cols)` finds the limiting factor for placing additional rooks.

4. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The program iteratively multiplies numbers from 1 to `m` to compute the factorial.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to prevent overflow.

5. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are correctly printed.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment accurately describes the solution and the program's behavior aligns with the expected logic.

**Final: True**
