### Reasoning

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) initial valid moves (with mirroring).
   - No two rooks can attack each other, meaning they cannot be in the same row or column.

2. **Initial Moves Analysis**:
   - After the initial \( k \) moves, certain rows and columns become occupied.
   - The remaining rows and columns form "free" spaces where we can place rooks without attacking the existing ones.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - Due to the symmetry of the problem, the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining free rows equals the number of ways to place them in the remaining free columns.
   - Therefore, the number of configurations is determined by the smaller number of free rows or columns.

4. **Calculation Logic**:
   - Let `free_rows` be the number of free rows.
   - Let `free_cols` be the number of free columns.
   - The minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` (`m`) determines the number of positions where we can freely place rooks.
   - The number of ways to place \( m \) rooks in \( m \) free positions is \( m! \).

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be very large, we compute the factorial modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

6. **Program Verification**:
   - The program reads input correctly.
   - It calculates the number of free rows and columns.
   - It computes the minimum of the free rows and columns.
   - It computes the factorial of this minimum value modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - It outputs the result for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Function Summary**:
  - The function correctly processes a series of test cases.
  - It calculates and stores the product of the first \( m \) natural numbers (where \( m \) is the minimum between the number of unique row indices and the number of unique column indices) modulo \( MOD \).
  - If no unique row or column indices are provided, the function still processes the test case correctly by considering the full range of possible indices.
  - Edge cases such as when all rows or columns are identical, leading to zero unique indices, are handled appropriately by ensuring the product calculation considers the remaining indices.

- **Program Code**:
  - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read`.
  - It processes each test case and calculates the number of free rows and columns.
  - It computes the factorial of the minimum of free rows and columns modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
  - It handles edge cases appropriately and outputs the results correctly.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the program code aligns with the described behavior.
