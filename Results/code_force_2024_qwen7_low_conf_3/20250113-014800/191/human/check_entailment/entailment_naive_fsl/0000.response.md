Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic to determine the number of free rows and columns and the calculation of the result are flawed.

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program assumes that the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` gives the number of rooks that can be placed in the final configuration. However, this is incorrect because the placement of rooks in the rows and columns must be independent. For example, if `n=4` and `k=1`, with a move at `(1, 2)`, the remaining rows and columns are `{1, 2, 3, 4}` and `{1, 2, 3, 4}` respectively. The correct way to calculate the number of configurations is to consider the product of combinations of placing rooks in the remaining rows and columns.

2. **Calculation Flaw**: The program calculates the result using a simple multiplication of integers, which does not account for the combinatorial nature of the problem. The correct approach would be to use combinations to calculate the number of ways to place the rooks in the remaining rows and columns.

A corrected version of the program would involve calculating the number of ways to choose positions for the rooks in the remaining rows and columns using combinatorial mathematics, ensuring that the placement does not violate the rules of the game.

Since the provided program does not handle the problem correctly, the correctness is **False**.
