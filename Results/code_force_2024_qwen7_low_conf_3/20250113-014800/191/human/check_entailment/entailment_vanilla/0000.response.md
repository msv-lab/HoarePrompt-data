Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) initial valid moves (with mirroring). We need to ensure no two rooks attack each other.

2. **Initial Moves Analysis**: After the initial \( k \) moves, certain rows and columns become occupied. The remaining rows and columns form "free" spaces where we can place rooks without attacking the existing ones.

3. **Key Insight**: After the initial moves, the game is reduced to choosing positions for rooks in the remaining free rows and columns. Importantly, due to the symmetry of the problem, the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining rows equals the number of ways to place them in the remaining columns. This is because every placement in a free row can correspond to a unique placement in a free column (and vice versa).

4. **Calculation Logic**:
   - Let `free_rows` be the number of free rows.
   - Let `free_cols` be the number of free columns.
   - The minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` (`m`) determines the number of positions where we can freely place rooks (since rooks cannot share rows or columns).
   - The number of ways to place \( m \) rooks in \( m \) free positions is \( m! \).

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we compute the factorial modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

6. **Program Verification**:
   - The program reads input correctly.
   - It calculates the number of free rows and columns.
   - It computes the minimum of the free rows and columns.
   - It computes the factorial of this minimum value modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - It outputs the result for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
