`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is a non-negative integer, `c2` is a non-negative integer, `c3` is a non-negative integer, `c4` is a non-negative integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` is an input integer**
