To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and understand how each variable evolves over time.

### Loop Analysis

**Loop Variables:**
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`: These are updated based on user input within the loop.
- `i`: Incremented by 1 each time the loop iterates, starting from \(2 \cdot 10^6 + 1\).
- `t`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

**Loop Body:**
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(a - b) > 1:
        print(0)
    elif a == b:
        if a == 0:
            print(int(c == 0 or d == 0))
        else:
            result = (f[a - 1 + c] * f[a + d] + f[a - 1 + d] * f[a + c]) * pow(
                f[a - 1] * f[d] * f[a] * f[c], -1, mod) % mod
            print(result)
    else:
        a = max(a, b)
        result = f[a - 1 + c] * f[a - 1 + d] * pow(f[a - 1] ** 2 * f[c] * f[d], -1, mod) % mod
        print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are inputs from the user.
   - If `abs(a - b) > 1`, the program prints `0`.
   - If `a == b`:
     - If `a == 0`, prints `int(c == 0 or d == 0)`.
     - Otherwise, updates `a` to `max(a, b)` and calculates `result`.
   - If `a != b`, updates `a` to `max(a, b)` and calculates `result`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - The process repeats with new inputs for `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`.
   - The variable `i` increments, but it is not directly used in the logic inside the loop.
   - The variable `t` remains constant unless it is redefined outside the loop.

### Final Output State

After the loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, the following should hold true:

- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` will have been updated based on the inputs provided during each iteration.
- The variable `i` will be `2 \cdot 10^6 + 1 + t`.
- The variable `t` will be the final count of iterations.
- The variables `c_1`, `c_2`, `c_3`, `c_4` will retain their initial values since they are not updated within the loop.
- The variable `mod` remains `998244353`.
- The variable `f` remains unchanged as it is precomputed before the loop starts.
- The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` will have been processed according to the conditions inside the loop.

### Output State

The output state after the loop executes all iterations should describe the final values of the relevant variables:

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the last values provided by the user during the iterations, `i` is \(2 \cdot 10^6 + 1 + t\), `t` is the number of iterations, `c_1`, `c_2`, `c_3`, `c_4` are the initial non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq c_i \leq 10^6\) and their sum does not exceed \(4 \cdot 10^6\), `mod` is 998244353, `f` is a list containing the factorials of all integers from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^6\) modulo 998244353.**

This encapsulates the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
