Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing four non-negative integers \(c_1, c_2, c_3,\) and \(c_4\). It calculates and prints a specific value based on these integers. If the absolute difference between two input integers \(a\) and \(b\) is greater than 1, it prints 0. If \(a\) equals \(b\), it checks if \(a\) is zero and prints 1 if both \(c\) and \(d\) are zero, otherwise it computes and prints a result involving factorials modulo 998244353. If \(a\) and \(b\) differ by exactly 1, it adjusts \(a\) to be the larger of the two and computes and prints another result involving factorials modulo 998244353.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(a\) and \(b\) differ by more than 1, the function correctly prints 0.
- If \(a\) equals \(b\) and both \(c\) and \(d\) are zero, the function correctly prints 1.
- If \(a\) equals \(b\) and either \(c\) or \(d\) is non-zero, the function computes and prints the result using factorials modulo 998244353.
- If \(a\) and \(b\) differ by exactly 1, the function computes and prints the result using factorials modulo 998244353.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the input integers \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) are outside the specified bounds (e.g., \(0 \leq c_i \leq 10^6\) and the sum does not exceed \(4 \cdot 10^6\)). However, the code assumes valid inputs within these constraints, and it is assumed that the input validation is performed elsewhere in the program.
