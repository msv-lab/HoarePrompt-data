Postcondition: **`a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input. If `a` equals 0, the function prints `int(c == 0 or d == 0)`. Otherwise, `a` is the larger of the original `a` and `b`, `result` is calculated as \( f[a - 1 + c] \times f[a - 1 + d] \times f[a - 1] \). Note that `abs(a - b) <= 1` holds true.**
