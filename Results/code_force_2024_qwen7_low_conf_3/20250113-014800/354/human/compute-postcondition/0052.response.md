The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on test cases where each test case includes four non-negative integers \(c_1, c_2, c_3,\) and \(c_4\) such that \(0 \leq c_i \leq 10^6\), and the sum of \(c_i\) for all test cases does not exceed \(4 \cdot 10^6\). The function processes these test cases, and based on the given constraints, it returns a specific value or set of values for each test case.

Since the exact output for each test case is not specified in the problem statement, we can only describe the input constraints and the nature of the function's operation without detailing the exact return value. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of test cases, each containing four non-negative integers \(c_1, c_2, c_3,\) and \(c_4\), and return a specific value or set of values based on these integers.
