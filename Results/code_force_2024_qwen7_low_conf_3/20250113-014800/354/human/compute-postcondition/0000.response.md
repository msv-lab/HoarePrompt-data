The code initializes a constant `MOD` with the value `998244353`. This assignment does not affect the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is a non-negative integer, `c2` is a non-negative integer, `c3` is a non-negative integer, `c4` is a non-negative integer, and MOD is 998244353.**
