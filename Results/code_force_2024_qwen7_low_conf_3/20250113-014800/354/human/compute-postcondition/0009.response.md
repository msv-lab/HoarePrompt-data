The function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` is called with `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` as arguments, but the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided. Therefore, the value of `result` depends on what `func_1` does with its inputs. Since the function's behavior is not specified, the only thing we can definitively say is that `result` is the return value of `func_1`.

Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`**
