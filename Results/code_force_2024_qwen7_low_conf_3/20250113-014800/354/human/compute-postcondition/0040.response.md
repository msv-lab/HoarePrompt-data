The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Since the initial values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified in the input, we represent them as the result of the input operation.

The initial conditions state that `a` is not 0 and `abs(a - b) <= 1`. After the code runs, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be the integers input by the user. However, the values of `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged according to the initial state, which means they are the same as the first, second, and third integers input by the user respectively. The value of `a` changes to the first integer input by the user.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input, and abs(`a` - `b`) <= 1.**
