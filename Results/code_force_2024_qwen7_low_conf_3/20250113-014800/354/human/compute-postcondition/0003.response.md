According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` being non-negative integers do not affect the loop's execution.
- `MOD` being set to 998244353 does not affect the loop's execution.
- `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`c1` is a non-negative integer, `c2` is a non-negative integer, `c3` is a non-negative integer, `c4` is a non-negative integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
