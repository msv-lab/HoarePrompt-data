The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. The original values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are replaced by the newly entered values. The `results` list remains unchanged, and `t` is reduced by 1. 

Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `t` is reduced by 1**
