Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step by step.

### Initial State:
- `c1` is an input integer.
- `c2` is an input integer.
- `c3` is an input integer.
- `c4` is an input integer.
- `MOD` is 998244353.
- `t` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` executed `t` times (initially, this list is empty).

### Loop Code:
```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Output States After Some Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration:**
  - `c1` is an input integer.
  - `c2` is an input integer.
  - `c3` is an input integer.
  - `c4` is an input integer.
  - `MOD` is 998244353.
  - `t` is 1.
  - `results` is a list containing at least one element, and the value of `result` is printed.
  
- **After 2 iterations:**
  - `c1` is an input integer.
  - `c2` is an input integer.
  - `c3` is an input integer.
  - `c4` is an input integer.
  - `MOD` is 998244353.
  - `t` is 1.
  - `results` is a list containing at least two elements, and the value of `result` is printed.
  
- **After 3 iterations:**
  - `c1` is an input integer.
  - `c2` is an input integer.
  - `c3` is an input integer.
  - `c4` is an input integer.
  - `MOD` is 998244353.
  - `t` is 1.
  - `results` is a list containing at least three elements, and the value of `result` is the second element in the list.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `MOD`:** These variables do not change during the loop execution. They remain the same as their initial values.
2. **Variable `t`:** This variable remains unchanged as well, and its value is always 1 because the loop does not increment or modify `t`.
3. **Variable `results`:** This is the only variable that changes. It starts as an empty list and gets populated with the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. Each time the loop iterates, it prints one of the elements in the list.

### Final Output State After All Iterations:
Since the loop does not modify any of the variables except `results`, and it only prints the elements of `results`, the final state will be the same as after the last iteration provided in the example states.

- `c1` is an input integer.
- `c2` is an input integer.
- `c3` is an input integer.
- `c4` is an input integer.
- `MOD` is 998244353.
- `t` is 1.
- `results` is a list containing all the elements printed during the loop executions.

Thus, the output state after the loop has finished executing is:

**Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` executed `t` times.**
