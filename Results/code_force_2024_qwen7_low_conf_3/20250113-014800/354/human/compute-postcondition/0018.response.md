According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop can continue executing as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `c1` is an input integer
- `c2` is an input integer
- `c3` is an input integer
- `c4` is an input integer
- `MOD` is 998244353
- `t` is 1
- `results` is a list containing at least one element, and the value of `result` was printed

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must contain at least two elements, and the loop will take the first unprocessed element from the list.

State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least two elements**
