The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. The `MOD` variable remains unchanged, `t` must still be greater than 0, and `results` is still an empty list. Since the input values for `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are not specified in the initial state, we represent them as input integers.

Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
