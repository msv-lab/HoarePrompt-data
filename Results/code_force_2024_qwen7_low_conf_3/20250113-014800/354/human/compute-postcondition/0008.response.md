The code `c1, c2, c3, c4 = map(int, input().split())` reads four space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. The initial state only mentions the assignment of these variables, but does not specify their initial values. After executing this line of code, the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` will be the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers input by the user.**
