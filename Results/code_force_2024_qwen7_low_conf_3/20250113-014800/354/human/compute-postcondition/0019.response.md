The code snippet `print(result)` simply prints the value of the `result` variable without changing its value. Since the initial state does not specify what `result` is initially, the only thing that happens here is the printing of the current value of `result`. However, the value of `result` itself is not updated by this line of code.

Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is printed**
