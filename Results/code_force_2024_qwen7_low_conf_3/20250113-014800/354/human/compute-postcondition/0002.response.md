The given code initializes an empty list `results`. The variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `MOD`, and `t` remain unchanged and retain their initial values. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`c1` is a non-negative integer, `c2` is a non-negative integer, `c3` is a non-negative integer, `c4` is a non-negative integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list**
