According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. The loop iterates over each element in `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `c1` is an input integer
- `c2` is an input integer
- `c3` is an input integer
- `c4` is an input integer
- `MOD` is 998244353
- `t` is 1
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements
- `result` is printed

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must contain at least three elements, and `result` will be the next element in the list.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `c1` remains the same (an input integer)
- `c2` remains the same (an input integer)
- `c3` remains the same (an input integer)
- `c4` remains the same (an input integer)
- `MOD` remains the same (998244353)
- `t` remains the same (1)
- `results` must now contain at least three elements
- `result` will be the second element in the `results` list (since the first one was just processed)

State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least three elements, `result` is the second element in the list**
