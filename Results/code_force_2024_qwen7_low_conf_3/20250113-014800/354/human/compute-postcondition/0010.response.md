`result` is assigned the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. The value of `result` is now stored in `results.append(result)`, which adds the value of `result` to the list `results`. The other variables (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`**
