Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements in the `results` list.
   - The variable `result` takes on each element of the `results` list one by one.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Loop**:
   - For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element.
   - If `results` is empty, the loop body will not be executed.

3. **Current States of the Variables**:
   - `c1` is an input integer.
   - `c2` is an input integer.
   - `c3` is an input integer.
   - `c4` is an input integer.
   - `MOD` is set to 998244353.
   - `t` is 0 (initial value).
   - `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` executed `t` times, which is currently empty since `t` is 0.

### Adjusting the States:

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element. Since `t` is initially 0, we need to increment `t` to ensure that `func_1` is called at least once, thus populating the `results` list.

### Final State Adjustment:

- `results` must contain at least one element.
- To achieve this, `t` must be incremented to 1, ensuring `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` is called at least once.

### Final State:

State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element**.
