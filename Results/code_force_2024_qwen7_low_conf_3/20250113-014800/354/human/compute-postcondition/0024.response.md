Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of four non-negative integers (c1, c2, c3, c4) from standard input, calls another function `func_1` with these integers, collects the results in a list, and prints each result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. The final state of the program includes the list of results after processing all inputs, the modulus constant `MOD` set to 998244353, and the variable `t` set to the number of input sets processed. Potential edge cases include when `t` is 0, in which case no results are collected or printed. Additionally, the function assumes valid integer inputs within the specified range; handling of invalid inputs such as non-integer or out-of-range values is not addressed in the provided code.**
