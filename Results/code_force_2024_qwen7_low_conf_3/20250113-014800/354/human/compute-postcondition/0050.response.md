Postcondition: **`a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input, and abs(`a` - `b`) <= 1. If abs(`a` - `b`) > 1, the function prints 0. Otherwise, if `a` equals 0, the function prints `int(c == 0 or d == 0)`. Otherwise, `a` is the larger of the original `a` and `b`, and `result` is calculated as \( f[a - 1 + c] \times f[a - 1 + d] \times f[a - 1] \).**
