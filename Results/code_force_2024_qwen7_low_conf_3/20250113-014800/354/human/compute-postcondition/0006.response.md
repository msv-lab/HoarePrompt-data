`results` is an empty list before the code execution. The code appends the `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`) to `results`. The `result` value is not specified in the code snippet, so it remains as the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. The other variables (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `MOD`, `t`, and `results` before appending) are not affected.

Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`**
