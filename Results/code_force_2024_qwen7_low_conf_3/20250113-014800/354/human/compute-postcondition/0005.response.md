The code assigns the result of the function call `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so its exact behavior cannot be determined. However, we know that `result` now holds whatever value `func_1` returns. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`**
