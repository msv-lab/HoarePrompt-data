Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` executed `t` times.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are non-negative integers.
   - `MOD` is set to 998244353.
   - `t` is a non-negative integer (input integer).
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - In each iteration, it takes four integers as input (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`), processes them using the function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - After `t` iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0.
   - Each iteration modifies `results` by appending the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`.
   - Therefore, `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the respective inputs.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables will be as described above.
