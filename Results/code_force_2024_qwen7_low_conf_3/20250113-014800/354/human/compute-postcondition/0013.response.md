The function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` is called with the arguments `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `result`. The variable `t` is reduced by 1, but its initial value is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined here, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, and `t` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`**
