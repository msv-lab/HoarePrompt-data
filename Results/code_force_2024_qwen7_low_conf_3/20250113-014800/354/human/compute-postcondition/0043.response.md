The given code snippet does not directly involve the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Instead, it references a function `f` and a modulus value `mod`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the function `f` or the value of `mod`. Additionally, the code does not modify the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`; it only uses them in a computation.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are already defined as the integers input by the user, and no direct assignment or modification occurs within the provided code snippet, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The computation performed involves the function `f` and the modulus `mod`, but their specific values are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact value of `result`.

Given the initial conditions and the fact that the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, the output state is:

**`a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input, and abs(`a` - `b`) <= 1.**
