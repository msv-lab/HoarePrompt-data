Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `c1` is an input integer
  - `c2` is an input integer
  - `c3` is an input integer
  - `c4` is an input integer
  - `MOD` is 998244353
  - `t` must be greater than 0
  - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`

- Loop statement:
  ```python
  for _ in range(t):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `t` times. At the end of each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
2. **Variables Involved**: 
   - `t`: This variable determines the number of iterations left.
   - `results`: This list accumulates the results of calling `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: At the start of the first iteration, `t` is greater than 0.
2. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` remain unchanged.
   - `MOD` remains unchanged (998244353).
   - `results` contains the result of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` from the previous iteration.

3. **For the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs for `t` times, after the previous iteration, `t` is reduced by 1.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` remain the same.
- `MOD` remains the same (998244353).
- `results` now contains the results from the previous iteration, plus potentially new results if `func_1` is called again.
- `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
- `c1` is an input integer
- `c2` is an input integer
- `c3` is an input integer
- `c4` is an input integer
- `MOD` is 998244353
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` from the previous iteration and potentially new results

**State:**
**`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` from the previous iteration and potentially new results**
