Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` to compute the number of ways to achieve a certain state based on the given constraints. The table `dp` is initialized such that `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating one way to achieve a state with zero items using zero counts. The function then iterates through possible values up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` and updates the table according to specific conditions. After the loop, the function calculates the sum of the last row of the `dp` table (`dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)]`) and returns this sum modulo `998244353`. The function handles edge cases where some `ci` values are zero, ensuring that the corresponding entries in the `dp` table are correctly updated based on the remaining `ci` values.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If any of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4` is zero, the function still correctly updates the `dp` table by only considering the non-zero `ci` values.
- The function ensures that all values in the `dp` table are computed modulo `998244353`, preventing overflow issues.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs for `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. While the annotations mention that these values are non-negative integers, the code itself does not include checks for these conditions. Therefore, the function should include input validation to ensure that the parameters are valid non-negative integers.
