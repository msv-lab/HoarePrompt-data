The code `a = max(a, b)` updates the value of `a` to be the maximum of the current values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state where `a` is not 0 and `abs(a - b) <= 1`, we know that the values of `a` and `b` are such that `a` is at least as large as `b`.

Since the initial value of `a` is not specified but it is updated to be the maximum of `a` and `b`, and given that `a` is not 0 and `abs(a - b) <= 1`, the value of `a` after execution will be `a` (since `a` is already the larger value or equal to `b`). The values of `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Thus, the Output State is:

**`a` is the larger of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input, and abs(`a` - `b`) <= 1.**
