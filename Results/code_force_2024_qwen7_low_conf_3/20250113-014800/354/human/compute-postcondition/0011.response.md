To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given information and the structure of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `c1` is an input integer.
- `c2` is an input integer.
- `c3` is an input integer.
- `c4` is an input integer.
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`.

### For Loop Structure:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `t` iterations. The loop variable `_` is used here, which is common when the loop index is not needed. This means the loop simply iterates `t` times.

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - No specific variables are mentioned as being modified within the loop body (since the body is omitted).
   - The only state that changes is the number of remaining iterations, which is controlled by the `range(t)` construct.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop simply iterates `t` times, there are no specific variables that need to be modified for the loop to execute again.
- The only thing that needs to be adjusted is the count of remaining iterations, which decreases by 1 each time the loop runs.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the number of remaining iterations (`t`) must be reduced by 1.

### Updated State:
State: **`c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `t` must be reduced by 1**.

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time before reaching its limit.
