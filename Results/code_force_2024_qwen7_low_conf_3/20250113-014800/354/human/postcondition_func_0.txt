The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` to compute the number of ways to achieve a certain state based on the given constraints. The table `dp` is initialized such that `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating one way to achieve a state with zero items using zero counts. The function then iterates through possible values up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` and updates the table according to specific conditions. After the loop, the function calculates the sum of the last row of the `dp` table (`dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)]`) and returns this sum modulo `998244353`. The function handles edge cases where some `ci` values are zero, ensuring that the corresponding entries in the `dp` table are correctly updated based on the remaining `ci` values.
