### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires constructing a one-dimensional chain using elements of four different types, ensuring that each element connects properly to its neighbors based on their connection types.
   - The goal is to find the number of ways to form a single continuous chain using all available elements. Each element can be of one of four types, and connections between elements must be valid.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The solution uses a DP table (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a chain of length `i` ending with element type `j`.
   - This approach correctly models the constraints and rules for connections between elements.

3. **Initialization and State Transitions**:
   - The initial state `dp[0][0] = 1` indicates that there's one way to have a chain of length 0 (an empty chain), which is trivially true.
   - The transitions update the count of ways to form chains ending with each type, considering the valid connections from previous states.
   - The transitions are handled correctly for each element type, ensuring that connections are valid according to the problem's rules.

4. **Boundary Conditions and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly checks if the current index `i` is within the bounds of the available elements (`i <= c1`, `i <= c2`, etc.). This ensures that the DP table is updated only for valid positions.
   - The result is computed modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` for each and collecting the results. It then prints the results for each test case.
   - The handling of input and output is correct and follows the problem's specifications.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various stages.
- The `dp` table is initialized correctly, and the transitions are handled appropriately.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach, boundary conditions, and input handling are all implemented correctly.
