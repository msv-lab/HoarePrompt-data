Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves constructing a one-dimensional chain using elements of four different types, where each type can appear multiple times. Each element can connect to another only if their adjacent connections are opposites. The goal is to calculate the number of ways to form a single continuous chain using all available elements.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to construct a chain of length `i` using elements of the four types. This approach correctly models the constraints and the rules for connections between elements.
3. **Initialization and State Transitions**:
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to construct a chain of length `i` ending with element type `j`.
   - The initial state `dp[0][0] = 1` means there's one way to have a chain of length 0 (an empty chain).
   - For each element type, the transition updates the count of ways to form chains ending with that type, considering the valid connections from previous states.
4. **Boundary Conditions and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the boundary conditions and constraints by checking if the current index is within the bounds of the available elements (`i <= c1`, `i <= c2`, etc.).
   - The result is calculated modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers.
5. **Input Handling**: Function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case, calling `func_1` for each and collecting the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
