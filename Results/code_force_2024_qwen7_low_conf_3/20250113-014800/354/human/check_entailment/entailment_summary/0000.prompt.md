You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a one-dimensional puzzle, all the elements of which need to be put in
one row, connecting with each other. All the puzzle elements are completely
white and distinguishable from each other only if they have different shapes.

Each element has straight borders at the top and bottom, and on the left and
right it has connections, each of which can be a protrusion or a recess. You
cannot rotate the elements.

You can see that there are exactly 4 types of elements. Two elements can be
connected if the right connection of the left element is opposite to the left
connection of the right element.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/3a4ca20f32b3885d01c9dc80911de1cfb06870fe.png)
All possible types of elements.

The puzzle contains c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 elements of each type. The puzzle is
considered complete if you have managed to combine all elements into one long
chain. You want to know how many ways this can be done.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The description of each test case contains 4 integers c_i (0 \le c_i \le 10^6
) — the number of elements of each type, respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of c_i for all test cases does not exceed 4
\cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of possible ways to solve
the puzzle.

Two methods are considered different if there is i , such that the types of
elements at the i position in these methods differ.

Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 998244353 .

If it is impossible to solve the puzzle, print 0 .

Function number 1 :

 '''
def func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4):
    MOD = 998244353
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1)]

        if i <= c2:
            dp[i][1] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][2] + dp[i - 1][3]) % MOD
        if i <= c3:
            dp[i][2] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][3]) % MOD
        if i <= c4:

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` to compute the number of ways to achieve a certain state based on the given constraints. The table `dp` is initialized such that `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating one way to achieve a state with zero items using zero counts. The function then iterates through possible values up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` and updates the table according to specific conditions. After the loop, the function calculates the sum of the last row of the `dp` table (`dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)]`) and returns this sum modulo `998244353`. The function handles edge cases where some `ci` values are zero, ensuring that the corresponding entries in the `dp` table are correctly updated based on the remaining `ci` values.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    MOD = 998244353
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (c1, c2, c3, c4) = map(int, input().split())
        result = func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of four non-negative integers (c1, c2, c3, c4) from standard input, calls another function `func_1` with these integers, collects the results in a list, and prints each result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. The final state of the program includes the list of results after processing all inputs, the modulus constant `MOD` set to 998244353, and the variable `t` set to the number of input sets processed. Potential edge cases include when `t` is 0, in which case no results are collected or printed. Additionally, the function assumes valid integer inputs within the specified range; handling of invalid inputs such as non-integer or out-of-range values is not addressed in the provided code.
