### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange elements in a chain. It correctly initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a chain using `i` elements, with the `j`th type of element being the last one added.
   - The base case `dp[0][0] = 1` ensures there's one way to have an empty chain.
   - For each element count `i`, it updates the DP table based on the rules of connection between the four types of elements.
   - Finally, it sums the last row of the DP table to get the total number of ways to form a chain with the given counts of each element type, taking care to return the result modulo \(998244353\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases, storing the results in a list and printing them.
   - The input reading and processing logic seems appropriate for the problem statement, assuming valid inputs are provided.

3. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The main function `if __name__ == '__main__': func_2()` correctly orchestrates the flow of the program.
   - The problem description matches the expected functionality of the functions: calculating the number of ways to arrange the elements based on their counts and connection rules.

Given that both functions correctly implement the required logic and handle the input as specified, the overall program should meet the requirements of the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
