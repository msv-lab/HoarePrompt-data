### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the number of ways to arrange the elements using dynamic programming.
   - It uses a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the number of elements placed so far and `j` represents the type of the last element placed.
   - The transitions in the DP table correctly account for the connections between elements, ensuring that each element can connect only to the appropriate neighboring type.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases and processes them one by one.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the input values and collects the results.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

3. **Function Summaries:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` correctly describes its behavior, including reading inputs, calling `func_1`, collecting results, and printing them.
   - The summary also mentions potential edge cases like `t` being zero, which is handled correctly by not processing any inputs in this scenario.

Given the above points, let's validate the original assessment.

- **Original Assessment:**
  - Correctness: **True**

- **Validation:**
  - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints and connections between elements.
  - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and ensures that the results are printed modulo 998244353.
  - There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the provided code fails to handle.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all test cases as expected, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries provided.
