### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves constructing a one-dimensional chain using elements of four different types, ensuring that each element connects properly with its neighbors. The goal is to calculate the number of ways to form a single continuous chain using all available elements. The key constraint is that elements can only connect if their adjacent connections are opposites.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to construct a chain of length `i` using elements of the four types. This approach correctly models the constraints and the rules for connections between elements.

3. **Initialization and State Transitions**:
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to construct a chain of length `i` ending with element type `j`.
   - The initial state `dp[0][0] = 1` means there's one way to have a chain of length 0 (an empty chain).
   - For each element type, the transition updates the count of ways to form chains ending with that type, considering the valid connections from previous states.

4. **Boundary Conditions and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the boundary conditions and constraints by checking if the current index is within the bounds of the available elements (`i <= c1`, `i <= c2`, etc.).
   - The result is calculated modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers.

5. **Input Handling**: Function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case, calling `func_1` for each and collecting the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

Given the function summaries and the provided example, the code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all valid configurations are considered, and the transitions correctly account for the constraints of the puzzle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries provided. The dynamic programming approach is appropriately implemented, and the logic for handling the connections and constraints is sound.
