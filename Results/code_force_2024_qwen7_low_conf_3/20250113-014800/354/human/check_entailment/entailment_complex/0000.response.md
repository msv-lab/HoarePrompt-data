### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to form a chain of puzzle elements.
   - It uses a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a chain ending with the `j-th` type of element using `i` elements in total.
   - The initialization and transitions are correct, ensuring that the constraints of the problem (i.e., elements can only connect if their adjacent connections match) are properly handled.
   - The function correctly sums the number of ways to form a valid chain using all available elements, returning the result modulo \(998244353\).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading four integers (representing the number of elements of each type).
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results in a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the inputs and outputs, ensuring that the dynamic programming solution is applied to each test case independently.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The main function `if __name__ == '__main__':` calls `func_2()`, which ensures that the entire input-output process is correctly managed.
   - Given the correct implementation of both `func_1` and `func_2`, and the problem statement being fully addressed by these functions, the overall program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Since both functions are implemented correctly and handle the problem as described, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
