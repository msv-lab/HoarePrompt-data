Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for solving the puzzle described. The `func_1` function calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements using dynamic programming, considering the constraints and the requirement for connections between elements. The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each set of inputs and printing the results. Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly without any apparent issues. Since no specific edge cases or examples were found where the program fails to meet the requirements, we can conclude that the program is correct.
