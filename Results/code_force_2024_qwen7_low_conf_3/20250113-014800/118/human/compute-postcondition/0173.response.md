`m` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 1, `o` is now an empty list, `f` is 0, `l` is 0, `y` is `b - 1`, `s` is `b`, `b` is greater than 0, and the current value of `y` satisfies `y % c == 0; `s` is `b`.
