Output State: **`i` is `k`, `j` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is an even integer, `l` is `1 + (n // 2)`, `r` is `n - (n // 2)`, and `ans[j]` is either `l` (if `i % 2 == 0`) or `r` (if `i % 2 != 0`) for each `j` in the sequence `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., n-1`**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Loop Structure**:
   - The outer loop runs from `0` to `k-1`.
   - The inner loop starts from `i` and increments by `k` up to `n-1`.

2. **Effect of the Outer Loop**:
   - For each `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`, the inner loop will run until it reaches `n-1`.
   - Since `k` is even, the loop will alternate between setting `ans[j]` to `l` and `r`.

3. **Effect of the Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop increments `j` by `k` each time, so it will cover every `k`-th index from `i` to `n-1`.
   - For even `i`, `ans[j]` is set to `l`, and `l` is incremented.
   - For odd `i`, `ans[j]` is set to `r`, and `r` is decremented.

4. **Final Values of Variables**:
   - After the outer loop completes, `i` will be `k` because the loop will have completed `k` iterations.
   - `j` will be `n` because the inner loop will have reached the last index `n-1`.
   - `l` and `r` will have adjusted based on the number of iterations:
     - `l` starts at `1` and is incremented by `1` for each even `i`.
     - `r` starts at `n` and is decremented by `1` for each odd `i`.
   - Since there are `k/2` even indices and `k/2` odd indices within the range `[0, n-1]` when `k` is even, `l` will be `1 + (n // 2)` and `r` will be `n - (n // 2)`.

5. **Values of `ans[j]`**:
   - For each `j` in the sequence `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., n-1`, `ans[j]` will be set to either `l` (if `i % 2 == 0`) or `r` (if `i % 2 != 0`).

Given this reasoning, the final output state is as stated above.
