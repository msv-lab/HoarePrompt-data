`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is 0 and is not divisible by 2, which remains unchanged. The value of `j` is 0 and is still valid. The value of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `n` is an integer, and `k` is an even integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `i` is not divisible by 2; `ans[j]` is `r-1`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 0; `n` is an integer, and `k` is an even integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `i` is not divisible by 2; `ans[j]` is `r-1`.**
