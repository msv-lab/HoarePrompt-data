The code subtracts 1 from `r`. The value of `i` is 0, `j` is `k`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is equal to `r`, and `l` is increased by 1. After the code runs, `r` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is equal to `r - 1`, `l` is increased by 1**
