`l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `l` was not specified, but it was increased by 1. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, and `ans[j]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is assigned `l + 1`, `l` is `l + 1`.**
