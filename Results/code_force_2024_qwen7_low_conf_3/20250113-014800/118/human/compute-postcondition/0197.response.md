Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 0, `o` is a list containing `[b - l]`, `f` is 0, `y` is `b - 1`, `s` is `b - l`, `b` is greater than 0, and `y % c` is not equal to 0. If `l % 2 == 0` and `f >= 0` and `l > 2`, then `l` is an odd number greater than 1 and less than or equal to the original value of `l`; otherwise, `l` remains 0. If `f < 0`, then `l` remains 0. If `l % 2 != 0` and `f >= 1`, then `l` is either `l - 1` (an odd number greater than 2) or remains unchanged (odd and greater than 1), `y` is `b - 1`, `s` is `b - l`, and `(l - 1) % 2` is not equal to 0 if `l` was greater than 2. Otherwise, `f` is 1 and `l` is 0.***
