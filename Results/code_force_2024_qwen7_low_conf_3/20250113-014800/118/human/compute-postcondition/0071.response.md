The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly but seems to operate on a set of test cases internally. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` with `k` being even.

Based on the given constraints and output cases, the function processes each test case and returns a specific value or message for each one. However, since the exact return values or messages for each test case are not specified in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameter constraints and the nature of the test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a set of test cases where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (where t is the number of test cases), and for each test case, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 with `k` being even. The function processes each test case and returns a specific value or message for each one.**
