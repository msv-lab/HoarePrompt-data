`ans[j]` is assigned the value of `r`. The value of `j` is still `k`, and `l` is increased by 1. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is equal to `r`, `l` is increased by 1**
