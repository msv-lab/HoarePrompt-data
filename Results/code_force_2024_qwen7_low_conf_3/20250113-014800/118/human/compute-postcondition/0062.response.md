Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is a value less than `k`.
   - `j` is `n + k`.
   - `ans[j]` is either `l` (if `i` is even) or `r - 1` (if `i` is odd).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs using the `range(i, n, k)` function, meaning it starts from `i` and increments by `k` until it reaches `n`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - Since `j` is already set to `n + k` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the current value of `j` is beyond the range specified by `range(i, n, k)`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute another iteration as `j` is already past the upper limit `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `j` is `n + k`, it indicates that the loop condition `j < n` is no longer true, and thus the loop will not execute another iteration.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop does not execute another iteration, the values of `i`, `j`, and `ans[j]` do not change from their previous values.

Therefore, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, and `ans[j]` is either `l` (if `i` is even) or `r - 1` (if `i` is odd)**
