`l` is decremented by 1. Given the precondition, `l` is currently an even number greater than 2. After decrementing, `l` will still be even and greater than 2 (since subtracting 1 from an even number results in an odd number, and the next even number is 2 more than the current odd number, ensuring it remains greater than 2).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 0, `o` is a list containing `[b - l]`, `f` is 0, `l` is now an odd number greater than 1 and less than or equal to the original value of `l`, `y` is `b - 1`, `s` is `b - l`, `b` is greater than 0, and `y % c` is not equal to 0.**
