Postcondition: **`total` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 0, `b` is the first integer input and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the second integer input and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is either `b - 1` or `b - l + 1` depending on the condition `f >= 0` and has been updated to `s - l`, `m` is 1 if `y` is divisible by `c` and 0 otherwise, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]`, `f` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition `f >= 0`, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, and `y` must be 0. If `l > 2`, then the values of `l` and other variables remain as per the if part.**
