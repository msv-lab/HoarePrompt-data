Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `k` is an even integer.
   - `l` is `1 + (n // 2)`.
   - `r` is `n - (n // 2)`.
   - `ans[j]` is either `l` (if `i % 2 == 0`) or `r` (if `i % 2 != 0`) for each `j` in the sequence `i, i+k, i+2k, ... , n-1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `0` to `k-1`.

3. **Effect of the Loop:**
   - Each iteration of the loop modifies `i` by incrementing it by `1`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, making `i` equal to `n + 1`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will become `n + 1`.
   - `j` remains `n` because the loop updates `i` but does not update `j` directly.

7. **Validation:**
   - The loop condition `i < k` must hold true for the next iteration. Since `i` was `n` and `n` is less than `k` (as per the constraints \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `i + 1` (which is `n + 1`) will still be less than `k` as long as `k > n + 1`.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is `n`.

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`**.
