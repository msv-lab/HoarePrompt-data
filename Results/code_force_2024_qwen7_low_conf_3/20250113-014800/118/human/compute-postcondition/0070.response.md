The code `print(*ans)` simply prints the contents of the list `ans`. Since no changes are made to the variables or the list `ans` within this line of code, the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `n`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `j` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is an even integer, `l` is `1 + (n // 2)`, `r` is `n - (n // 2)`, and `ans[j]` is either `l` (if `i % 2 == 0`) or `r` (if `i % 2 != 0`) for each `j` in the sequence `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., n-1`**
