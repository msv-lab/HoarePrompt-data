To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`
  - `j` is equal to `n`
  - `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters

- The for loop statement:
  ```python
  for j in range(i, n, k):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range defined by `range(i, n, k)`.
   - For the loop to execute, the initial condition should be `i <= n`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration:
     - `j` is `n`
     - `i` is less than or equal to `n`
     - `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters

3. **Loop Iteration Logic**:
   - The loop starts with `j = i` and increments `j` by `k` until `j < n`.

4. **Final Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - To continue the loop, `j` needs to be incremented from its current value (`n`) to a value that is still within the range defined by `range(i, n, k)`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be `n + k`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n + k` must still be within the range defined by `i` and `n`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments are needed:
- `j` should be set to `n + k`.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is less than or equal to `n`.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are valid loop parameters.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n + k`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters**.
