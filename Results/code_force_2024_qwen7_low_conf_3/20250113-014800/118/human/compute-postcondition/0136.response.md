Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `y` modulo `c` is 0 or not, `o` is a list containing `b` followed by `b - 2l`, `f` is either 1 or 0, `l` is updated to be 1 less than its original value and is either 0 or odd, `y` is 0, `s` is equal to `b - 2l`, and `l` is not divisible by 2.***

Explanation:
- If `f >= 1`, then `f` remains 0, as mentioned in the if part.
- If `f < 1`, then `f` is incremented by 1, as mentioned in the else part.
- Both parts agree that `l` is updated to be 1 less than its original value and is either 0 or odd.
- Both parts maintain the same conditions for `y`, `s`, and `l`.
- The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `h`, `m`, `o`) are consistent across both parts, ensuring they retain their respective conditions from the precondition.
