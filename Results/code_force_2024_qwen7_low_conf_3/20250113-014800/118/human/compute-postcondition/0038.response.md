`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `ans[j]` is unchanged, and `n` and `k` remain valid loop parameters.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `ans[j]` is assigned the value of `r-1`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters.**
