Postcondition: ***`total` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 0, `b` is the first integer input and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the second integer input and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is either `b - 1` or `b - l + 1` depending on the condition `f >= 0` and has been updated to `s - l`, `m` is 1 if `y` is divisible by `c` and 0 otherwise, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]`, and `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`. If `l % 2 == 0`, then if `y % c == 0`, `m` is 2 and `o` is `[b, b-1]`. Otherwise, `f` is set to 1 or 2 and `l` and other variables remain as they are after the update. If `l % 2 != 0`, then if `y % c != 0`, `f` is incremented by 1 and `l` and other variables remain as they are after the update.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts and their respective conditions.
