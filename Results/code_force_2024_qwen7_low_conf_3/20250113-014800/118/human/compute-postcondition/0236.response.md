Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer and `a > 1`; `b` is the newly input integer and `b > 0`; `c` is the newly input integer and `c > 0`; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `m` is 2 if `0 % c == 0` and 1 otherwise; `o` is either `[b, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 2]` depending on whether `0 % c == 0` and the relationship between `b` and `c`, plus an additional element `s` which is calculated based on the divisibility of `b - 2` by `c` and the value of `l`; `f` is 1 if `l` is odd and greater than 2 or `l` is 0, otherwise `f` is 0; `l` retains its original value; `y` is `0`; `s` is `b - 1 - l` if `b - 2` is divisible by `c` and `b - 2 - l` otherwise; `b` is greater than 0. If `f >= 1` at the beginning of the if-else block, `f` remains unchanged; otherwise, `f` is incremented by 1.***
