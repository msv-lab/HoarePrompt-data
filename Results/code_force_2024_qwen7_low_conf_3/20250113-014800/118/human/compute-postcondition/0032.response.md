`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` being `n` or less, `j` being `n`, `n` and `k` being valid loop parameters, and `i` being odd remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n` or less, `j` is `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `i` is odd, `ans[j]` is `r - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n` or less, `j` is `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `i` is odd, `ans[j]` is `r - 1`**
