Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have completed.

### Initial State
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is even.
- `l` is 1.
- `r` is `n`.
- `ans` is an array of length `n` filled with zeros.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(i, n, k):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        ans[j] = l
        l += 1
    else:
        ans[j] = r
        r -= 1
```

### Observations from the First Few Iterations

1. **First Iteration (`i` = 0):**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `l` which is 1.
   - `l` is incremented to 2.
   - `i` becomes 1.

2. **Second Iteration (`i` = 1):**
   - `j` is `k` (since `j` starts from `i` and increments by `k`).
   - `ans[k]` is set to `r` which is `n`.
   - `r` is decremented to `n - 1`.
   - `i` becomes 2.

3. **Third Iteration (`i` = 2):**
   - `j` is `2k`.
   - `ans[2k]` is set to `l` which is 2.
   - `l` is incremented to 3.
   - `i` becomes 3.

4. **Fourth Iteration (`i` = 3):**
   - `j` is `3k`.
   - `ans[3k]` is set to `r - 1` which is `n - 1`.
   - `r` is decremented to `n - 2`.
   - `i` becomes 4.

### General Pattern
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`.
- For each iteration, `j` increases by `k`.
- If `i` is even, `ans[j]` is set to the current value of `l`, and `l` is incremented.
- If `i` is odd, `ans[j]` is set to the current value of `r`, and `r` is decremented.

### Final Values After All Iterations

- `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` equals `n`.
- `l` will be incremented for each even `i`, so it will be `1 + (n // 2)`.
- `r` will be decremented for each odd `i`, so it will be `n - (n // 2)`.

Since `n` is the last value of `j`, and considering the loop increments `i` by 1 until `i` equals `n`, we can conclude that:

- The final state of `ans` will be partially filled according to the rule described.
- `l` will be `1 + (n // 2)`.
- `r` will be `n - (n // 2)`.

### Output State

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `l` is `1 + (n // 2)`, `r` is `n - (n // 2)`, and `ans[j]` is either `l` (if `i % 2 == 0`) or `r` (if `i % 2 != 0`) for each `j` in the sequence `i, i+k, i+2k, ... , n-1`**.
