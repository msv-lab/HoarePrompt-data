The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value remains unchanged because no operation on `t` is performed.

Thus, the updated states are:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer assigned from the first part of the input
- `k` is an integer assigned from the second part of the input, and it must satisfy \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer assigned from the first part of the input; `k` is an integer assigned from the second part of the input, and it must satisfy \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.**
