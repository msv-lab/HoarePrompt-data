The code `ans[j] = r` assigns the value `r` to the index `j` in the list `ans`. Given the initial state, the values of `i`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `j` is `n + k`. Therefore, `ans[j]` is set to `r`.

Output State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and the step `k` must result in the loop executing at least once; `ans[j]` is `r`**
