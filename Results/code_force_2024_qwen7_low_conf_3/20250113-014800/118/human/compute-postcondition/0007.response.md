`l` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `l` is not specified. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `n` is an integer, and `k` is an even integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); The current value of `i` is even; `ans[0]` is assigned a value (but the specific value is unknown); `l` is increased by 1.
