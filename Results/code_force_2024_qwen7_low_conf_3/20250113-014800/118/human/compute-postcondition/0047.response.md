According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the loop parameter `k`. The loop condition is `i < k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and `k` is a valid loop parameter. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, it is already equal to or greater than `k` (since `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, but `i` started from `n + 1`). Therefore, the loop cannot execute again based on the current values.

However, if we assume the problem is asking to adjust the states such that the loop could potentially execute again, we would need to set `i` to be less than `k`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be set to a value less than `k`.
- `j` remains as `n`.
- `n` and `k` remain as valid loop parameters.

State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters**
