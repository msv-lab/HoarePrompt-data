Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 1 if `y % c == 0` and 0 otherwise, `o` is `[b, b - 2l]` if `y % c == 0` and `[b - l, b - 2l]` otherwise, `f` is 1, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` if `y % c == 0` and either `l - 1` (an odd number greater than 2) or remains 0 otherwise, `y` is `b - 2`, `s` is `b - 2l`, and `b` is greater than 0.***

Explanation: The if part does not change the values of the variables since `f` is initially 0. The else part sets `f` to 1, which is the only change made to the variables. All other variables remain unchanged as per the else part's description.
