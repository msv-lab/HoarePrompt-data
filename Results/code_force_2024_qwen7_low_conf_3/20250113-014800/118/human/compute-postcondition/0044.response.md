`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i`, `j`, `n`, `k`, and `ans[j]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n + k`, `ans[j]` is assigned the value `r-1`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n + k`, `ans[j]` is assigned the value `r-1`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters**
