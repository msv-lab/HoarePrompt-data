`r` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is not specified in the initial state. The values of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `l`, `k`, `n`, and `ans[j]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the only variable that has been updated is `r`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2k, `l` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is 3, `r` is `r - 1`**
