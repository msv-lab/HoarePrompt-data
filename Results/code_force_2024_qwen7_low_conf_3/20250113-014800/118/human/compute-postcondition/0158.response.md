Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `y` modulo `c` is 0 or not (with `y` being `b-1`), `o` is a list updated as follows: if `y % c == 0`, then `o` is a list containing `b` and possibly `b - m` appended to it; otherwise, `o` is a list containing `b`, `b - 2l`, and `b - 3l` if `l` is even and greater than 2, otherwise it remains `[b, b - 2l]`, `f` is 0 or 1, `l` is updated to be 1 less than its original value and is either 0 or odd, `y` is `b-1`, and `s` is `b - m` or `b - 3l` depending on the value of `m` and `l`.***
