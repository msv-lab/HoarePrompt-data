`ans[j]` is assigned the value `l`. Since `j` is defined as `n + k`, the value of `ans[n + k]` is set to `l`. The values of `i` and `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n + k`, `ans[n + k]` is `l`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters**
