Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is the count of multiples of `c` within the range of `b`, `o` is a list containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `f` is the count of times `l` was even and greater than 2, `l` is `0` if no multiple of `c` was found or is the last decrement value of `l` if a multiple of `c` was found, `y` is `0`, `s` is the last calculated value of `s` which depends on the conditions inside the loop, and `b` is greater than 0.**
