`ans[j]` is assigned the value of `l`. The value of `j` is `n + k`, and since `i` is a value less than `k`, and `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, the precondition about `j` being greater than or equal to `i` is still valid. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and `ans[j]` is assigned the value `l`.**
