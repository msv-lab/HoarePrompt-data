`ans[j]` is assigned the value of `l`. Before this assignment, `j` is equal to `k` and `l` is increased by 1 from its previous value. Since `l` was not previously defined in the initial state, we assume it was increased by 1 before this line of code. Therefore, the updated value of `l` is whatever it was before plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is assigned `l + 1`, `l` is increased by 1**
