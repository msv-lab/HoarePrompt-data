The line `ans[j] = r` assigns the value of `r` to `ans[j]`. However, the initial state does not specify what `ans`, `j`, or `r` are, only the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `k`. Since the initial state does not provide the definition of `ans`, `j`, or `r`, and these variables are not initialized in the given code snippet, we can only state that `ans[j]` is now equal to `r`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer, and `k` is an even integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `i` is not divisible by 2; `ans[j]` is `r`**
