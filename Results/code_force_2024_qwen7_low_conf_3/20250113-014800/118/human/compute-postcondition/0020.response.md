`l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `l` was such that it was increased by 1. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `l` is `1 + 1` which is 2.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2k, `l` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is `l`**
