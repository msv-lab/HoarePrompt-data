Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is even.
- `l` is 1.
- `r` is `n`.
- `ans` is an array of length `n` filled with zeros.
- `i` is 0.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(i, n, k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over `j` from `i` to `n` in steps of `k`. Since `i` is initially 0, the loop will start at `j = 0`.
2. **Step Size**: `k` is an even integer and satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

### Necessary Adjustments:
To ensure the loop can execute:
- The loop should start at `j = 0`.
- The loop should continue as long as `j < n`.

Given that `i` is already set to 0, we need to ensure that the loop will continue to execute without encountering an issue due to the loop's condition.

Since the loop condition is based on `j` being less than `n`, and `j` increments by `k` (which is an even number), the loop will continue as long as `0 + mk < n` for some integer `m`.

### Final State Adjustment:
The key variables to consider for ensuring the loop can execute are `j` and the loop's termination condition (`j < n`). Given `i = 0`, the loop will start correctly, but we need to ensure `j` will increment within the bounds defined by `n`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` is 0.
- `j` must start at 0 and should not exceed `n - 1` to ensure the loop terminates properly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer, and `k` is an even integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)**.
