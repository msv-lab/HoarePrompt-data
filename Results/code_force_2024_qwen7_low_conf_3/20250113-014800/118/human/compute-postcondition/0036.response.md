`l` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `k`, and `ans[n]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters; `ans[n]` is equal to `l + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters; `ans[n]` is equal to `l + 1`.**
