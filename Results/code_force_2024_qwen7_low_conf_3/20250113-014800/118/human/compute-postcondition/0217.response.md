Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 1 if `y % c == 0` and 0 otherwise, `o` is `[b, b - 2l]` if `y % c == 0` and `[b - l, b - 2l]` otherwise, `f` is 1 if `l` is odd and greater than 2 or `l` is 0, otherwise `f` is 0, `l` is `l - 1` if `l` is even and greater than 2, otherwise `l` retains its original value, `y` is `b - 2`, `s` is `b - 2l`, and `b` is greater than 0.***
