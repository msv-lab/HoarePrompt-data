`l` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains less than `k`, `j` remains `n + k`, and `ans[j]` is assigned the value `l`. The output state is: `i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, `l` is increased by 1, and `ans[j]` is assigned the value `l`.

Output State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, `l` is increased by 1, and `ans[j]` is assigned the value `l`**
