`l` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and the step `k` must result in the loop executing at least once; `ans[n]` is `l`; `l` is now `l + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and the step `k` must result in the loop executing at least once; `ans[n]` is `l + 1`**
