The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will handle multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, where `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and `k` is even. The function will process each test case and return a result based on the given conditions.

For each test case, the function will return a specific value or message based on the relationships between `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases, each containing integers `n` and `k`, and returns a result based on the given conditions.**
