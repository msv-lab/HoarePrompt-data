Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `y` modulo `c` is 0 or not (with `y` being `b-1`), `o` is `[b, b - 2l, b - 3l]` if `y` modulo `c` is 0, otherwise it is `[b, b - 2l, b - 3l]`, `f` is 0 or 1, `l` is either 0 or even, `y` is `b-1`, `s` is now equal to `b - 3l`, and `l` is not divisible by 2.***

Explanation:
- In the if part, the condition `l > 2` is checked. If true, `l` is updated to be 1 less than its original value and becomes either 0 or even.
- Since there is no else part, regardless of the outcome of the if condition, the final state of the variables remains as follows:
  - `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - `a`, `b`, `c`, `h`, `m`, `o`, `f`, `y`, and `s` retain their respective properties as specified in the precondition and the if part.
  - `l` is updated to be 1 less than its original value and becomes either 0 or even.
- Therefore, the overall postcondition encompasses both the scenarios where the if condition is true and false, leading to the same final state as described above.
