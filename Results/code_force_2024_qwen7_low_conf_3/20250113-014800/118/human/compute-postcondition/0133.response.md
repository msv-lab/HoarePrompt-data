Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `y` modulo `c` is 0 or not, `o` is a list containing `b` followed by `b - 2l`, `f` is incremented by 1 if the initial value of `l` is odd and `f` remains unchanged if `l` is even, `y` is 0, `s` is equal to `b - 2l`, and `l` is either -1 or even.***
