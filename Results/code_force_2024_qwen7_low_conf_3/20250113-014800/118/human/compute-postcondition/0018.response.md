Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is `k`
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `k` is an even integer
   - `ans[j]` is either `l + 1` or `r - 1` depending on whether `i % 2 == 0`
   - `l` is increased by 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i` to `n` with a step of `k`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is `k`, and `i % 2 == 0`.
   - Since `i` is 0, `ans[j]` is set to `l + 1` because `0 % 2 == 0`.
   - `l` is increased by 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `k`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `k + k = 2k`.
   - `i` remains 0 as it does not change within the loop.
   - `l` is increased by 1 again since `i` is still 0, making `ans[j]` now `l + 1` (since `0 % 2 == 0`).

5. **Final States:**
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` becomes `2k`.
   - `l` is increased by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2k, `l` is increased by 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is `l + 1` depending on whether `i % 2 == 0**.
