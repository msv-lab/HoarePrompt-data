The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was previously equal to the value of `ans[j]` (where `j` is `n + k`), after this operation, `l` will be `ans[j] + 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, `j`, and `ans[j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, and `ans[j]` is `l - 1`**
