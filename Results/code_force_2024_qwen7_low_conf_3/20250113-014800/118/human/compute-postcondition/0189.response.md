Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 0, `o` is a list containing `[b - l]`, `f` is 1, `l` is 0, `y` is `b - 1`, `s` is `b - l`, `b` is greater than 0, and `l % 2` is not equal to 0.***

Explanation: The postcondition includes all the variables and their constraints from the precondition, and it updates the value of `f` to 1 based on the given if condition `if (f >= 1):`.
