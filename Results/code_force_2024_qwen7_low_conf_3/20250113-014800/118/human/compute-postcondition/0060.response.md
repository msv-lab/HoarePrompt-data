`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, and `ans[j]` is `r`. The operation `r -= 1` updates the value of `r` but does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and the step `k` must result in the loop executing at least once; `ans[j]` is `r - 1`**
