Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer and `a > 1`; `b` is the newly input integer and `b > 0`; `c` is the newly input integer and `c > 0`; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `m` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition `0 % c == 0`; `o` is either `[b, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 2]` depending on whether `0 % c == 0` and the relationship between `b` and `c`; `f` is incremented by 1 if `l` is even and greater than 2, otherwise `f` retains its original value; `l` is decremented by 1 if `l` is even and greater than 2, otherwise `l` retains its original value; `y` is `0`; `s` is calculated as follows: if `y % c == 0`, then `s` is `b - 1` if `m` is 2 and `b - 2` if `m` is 3; otherwise, `s` is `b - 1 - l` if `b - 2` is divisible by `c` and `b - 2 - l` otherwise; `b` is greater than 0.***
