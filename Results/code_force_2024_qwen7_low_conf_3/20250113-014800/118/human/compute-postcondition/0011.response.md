Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer, and `k` is an even integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `ans[j]` is either assigned a value (specific value unknown) when `i` is even, or is set to `r-1` when `i` is odd. Additionally, `l` is increased by 1 regardless of the value of `i`.***
