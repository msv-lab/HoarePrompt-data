The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `l` is `ans[j]`, which is `ans[n + k]`. Since `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `j` is `n + k`, and the value of `l` is updated to its previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n + k`, `ans[n + k]` is the new value of `l`, which is `l + 1`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n + k`, `ans[n + k]` is `l + 1`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters**
