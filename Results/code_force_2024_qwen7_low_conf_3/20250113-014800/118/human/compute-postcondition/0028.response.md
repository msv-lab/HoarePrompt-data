`ans[j]` is assigned the value of `l`. The value of `j` is equal to `n`, and the value of `i` is an even integer less than or equal to `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the precondition that the current value of `i` is even remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is an even integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `ans[j]` is equal to `l`**
