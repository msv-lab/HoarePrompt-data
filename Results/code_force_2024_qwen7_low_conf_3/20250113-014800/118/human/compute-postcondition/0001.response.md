The code initializes two variables `l` and `r` to 1 and `n` respectively. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`. After executing the code, `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer assigned from the first part of the input; `k` is an integer assigned from the second part of the input, and it must satisfy \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is even; `l` is 1; `r` is `n`.**
