Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `y` modulo `c` is 0 or not (with `y` being `b-1`), `o` is `[b, b - 2l, b - 3l]` if `y` modulo `c` is 0, otherwise it is `[b, b - 2l, b - 3l]`, `f` is 0 or 1, `l` is updated to be 1 less than its original value and is either 0 or odd, `y` is `b-1`, `s` is now equal to `b - 3l`, and `l` is not divisible by 2.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the if-else block, summarizing the state of all relevant variables after the execution of the block.
