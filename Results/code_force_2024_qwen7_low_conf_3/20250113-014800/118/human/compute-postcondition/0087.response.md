`f` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `f` was previously determined by a loop condition, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 0, `o` is an empty list, `f` is 0, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, and `y` is `b - 1`; `s` is equal to `b`.**
