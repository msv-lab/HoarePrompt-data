Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 1, `b` is the newly input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the newly input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 0, `o` is the list `[b]`, `f` is at least 1, `l` is 1 less than its original value and is not divisible by 2, `y` is `b - 1`, `s` is equal to `b - l`, `l` is not divisible by 2. If `l > 2`, then `l` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.***
