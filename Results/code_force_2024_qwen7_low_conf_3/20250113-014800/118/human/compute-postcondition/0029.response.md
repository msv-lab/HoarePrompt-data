`l` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains an even integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `k` remains a valid loop parameter. The state of `ans[j]` is not mentioned to be updated, so it remains `l`. Therefore, the value of `l` becomes `l + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is an even integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters, `ans[j]` is equal to `l + 1`**
