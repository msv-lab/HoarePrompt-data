`ans[j]` is assigned the value `l`. The value of `i` is less than `k`, and the value of `j` is `n + k`. The value of `ans[j]` is now `l`, regardless of whether `i` is even or odd because the assignment overrides the previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, and `ans[j]` is `l`**
