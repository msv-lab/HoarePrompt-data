`ans[j]` is assigned the value `r`. The value of `j` is `n + k`. If `i` is even, `ans[j]` was previously `l`, and now it is `r`. If `i` is odd, `ans[j]` was previously `r - 1`, and now it is `r`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, and `ans[j]` is `r`.

Output State: **`i` is a value less than `k`, `j` is `n + k`, and `ans[j]` is `r`**
