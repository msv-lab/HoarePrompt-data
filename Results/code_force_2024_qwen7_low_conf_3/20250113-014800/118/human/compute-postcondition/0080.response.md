The given code snippet is a print statement that prints the elements of the list `o`. The list `o` contains the sequence of values of `s` after each iteration. However, the code does not modify the values of any variables or perform any operations on them. Therefore, the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 0, `b` is the first integer input and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the second integer input and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is 1 if `y` is divisible by `c` for any iteration and 0 otherwise, `o` is a list containing the sequence of values of `s` after each iteration, `f` is 0 or 1 based on the loop conditions, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, and `y` is `b - 1` (the last index of the loop).**
