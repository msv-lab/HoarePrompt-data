Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`.
   - `j` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters.

2. **Understand the for loop condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j` (which is `n`) to `n` with a step of `k`.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `j` is initially set to `n`, and the loop starts with `j` equal to `n`, it means that `j` cannot be incremented to be less than `n` because `j` is already equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - Since `j` is already equal to `n`, and the loop increments `j` by `k`, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`. However, since `j` is currently equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition cannot be satisfied based on the given states.

**State: **`i` is an integer less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` and `k` are valid loop parameters.**
