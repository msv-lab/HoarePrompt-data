`ans[j]` is assigned the value `r`. From the initial state, we know that `j` is `2k`, and `ans[j]` is `l + 1` depending on whether `i % 2 == 0`. Given `i` is 0, `i % 2 == 0` is true, so `ans[j]` should be `l + 1`. Since `l` is increased by 1 in the initial state, `l` is now `1 + 1 = 2`. Therefore, `ans[j]` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2k, `l` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an even integer, `ans[j]` is 3**
