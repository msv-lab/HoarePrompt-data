Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer and `a` must be greater than 0, `b` is the final input integer and `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the final input integer and `c` must be greater than 0, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `m` is the count of multiples of `c` within the range of `b`, `o` is a list containing the sequence of values of `s` after each iteration, `f` is the count of times `l` was even and greater than 2, `l` is `0` if no multiple of `c` was found or is the last decrement value of `l` if a multiple of `c` was found, and `y` is `b - 1`.**
