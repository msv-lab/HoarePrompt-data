You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

# Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    (l, r) = (1, n)
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i, n, k):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                ans[j] = l
                l += 1
            else:
                ans[j] = r
                r -= 1
    print(*ans)





# Execution Summary:
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, the function initializes two pointers \(l\) and \(r\) to 1 and \(n\), respectively. It then iterates over a range defined by \(k\) and updates an array `ans` such that for every index \(j\) in the sequence \(i, i+k, i+2k, \ldots, n-1\), if the iteration index \(i\) is even, `ans[j]` is set to \(l\) and \(l\) is incremented, otherwise `ans[j]` is set to \(r\) and \(r\) is decremented. After processing all test cases, the function prints the contents of the `ans` array. This process ensures that the values in `ans` are alternately assigned based on the parity of the iteration index, starting from the left and right ends of the array. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, and for each test case, it processes integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
