Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a \(k\)-level permutation of length \(n\).
2. A \(k\)-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length \(k\) is at most 1.
3. The provided solution uses a strategy where the values are alternately assigned from the left and right ends of the array based on the parity of the iteration index.
4. Specifically, the inner loop fills the array `ans` such that for each segment of length \(k\), the elements are filled in a way that maintains a balanced distribution of values between the left (`l`) and right (`r`) ends.
5. Since \(k\) is even, this approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \(k\) will be balanced, as the values are alternately taken from the smallest and largest available values in the current segment.
6. The approach guarantees that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length \(k\) will be at most 1, meeting the requirement of a \(k\)-level permutation.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly constructs a \(k\)-level permutation for each test case according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
