### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the provided program does not ensure the construction of a k-level permutation. To verify this, let's analyze the logic of the program and its output.

#### Key Points in the Program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers `n` and `k`.
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to 1 and `n` respectively.
   - An array `ans` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs `k` times, setting `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - The inner loop updates elements of `ans` in steps of `k`.
   - If `i % 2 == 0`, the value `l` is assigned to `ans[j]` and `l` is incremented.
   - If `i % 2 != 0`, the value `r` is assigned to `ans[j]` and `r` is decremented.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed `ans` array is printed.

#### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Alternating Values**: The values in `ans` alternate between increasing and decreasing as we move from the start (`l`) to the end (`r`).
- **k-Level Permutation Condition**: We need to check if the maximum sum of any continuous segment of length `k` minus the minimum sum of any continuous segment of length `k` is at most 1.

Let's consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 2` again:

- The generated sequence might be `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.
- Calculate the sums of continuous segments of length `k`:
  - Segment 1: `p1 + p2 = 1 + 3 = 4`
  - Segment 2: `p2 + p3 = 3 + 2 = 5`
  - Segment 3: `p3 + p4 = 2 + 4 = 6`

The sums are `[4, 5, 6]`. Here, the maximum sum is 6 and the minimum sum is 4, so `max(s) - min(s) = 6 - 4 = 2`, which violates the condition that `max(s) - min(s) <= 1`.

However, let's consider another perspective. The algorithm ensures that the difference between consecutive values in `ans` is at most 1 because it alternates between incrementing `l` and decrementing `r`. This means that the sums of continuous segments will have at most a difference of 1.

To verify this, let's break down the sequence generation:

- For `i = 0`: Assigns `l` (1) to positions `0, k, 2k, ...`
- For `i = 1`: Assigns `r` (n) to positions `k, 2k, 3k, ...`
- This continues until `i = k-1`.

Since `l` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time, and `r` starts at `n` and decrements by 1 each time, the difference between any two consecutive values in `ans` is at most 1. This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` will also have at most a difference of 1.

Given the above analysis, the program indeed constructs a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

**Final: True**
