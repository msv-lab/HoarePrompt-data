You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    (l, r) = (1, n)
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i, n, k):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                ans[j] = l
                l += 1
            else:
                ans[j] = r
                r -= 1
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, the function initializes two pointers \(l\) and \(r\) to 1 and \(n\), respectively. It then iterates over a range defined by \(k\) and updates an array `ans` such that for every index \(j\) in the sequence \(i, i+k, i+2k, \ldots, n-1\), if the iteration index \(i\) is even, `ans[j]` is set to \(l\) and \(l\) is incremented, otherwise `ans[j]` is set to \(r\) and \(r\) is decremented. After processing all test cases, the function prints the contents of the `ans` array. This process ensures that the values in `ans` are alternately assigned based on the parity of the iteration index, starting from the left and right ends of the array. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, and for each test case, it processes integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program aims to generate a k-level permutation of length n for each test case. Here’s how the program works:

1. The outer loop iterates over each test case.
2. Inside the loop, `func_1()` is called, which takes two integers `n` and `k`.
3. The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to 1 and `n`, respectively.
4. An array `ans` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
5. A nested loop structure is used to fill the `ans` array. For each segment of length `k`, the values from `l` to `r` are placed alternately:
   - If `i` (current segment index) is even, the value `l` is assigned to the current position in `ans`, and `l` is incremented.
   - If `i` is odd, the value `r` is assigned to the current position in `ans`, and `r` is decremented.

To verify correctness, we need to check if this approach meets the requirements of a k-level permutation:
- The constructed permutation must have a maximum difference of at most 1 between any two sums of continuous segments of length `k`.

Let's analyze if this implementation satisfies the k-level permutation requirement:
- The segments of length `k` will alternate between high and low values due to the way `l` and `r` are used.
- Given `k` is even, the pattern ensures that the difference between consecutive sums of segments of length `k` will be minimized.
- The distribution of `l` and `r` ensures that the values are spread out but still maintain the required property.

Considering the logic and the constraints, the given implementation should correctly generate a k-level permutation for any valid inputs within the specified constraints.
