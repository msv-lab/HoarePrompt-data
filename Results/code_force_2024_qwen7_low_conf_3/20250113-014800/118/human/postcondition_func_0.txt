The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, the function initializes two pointers \(l\) and \(r\) to 1 and \(n\), respectively. It then iterates over a range defined by \(k\) and updates an array `ans` such that for every index \(j\) in the sequence \(i, i+k, i+2k, \ldots, n-1\), if the iteration index \(i\) is even, `ans[j]` is set to \(l\) and \(l\) is incremented, otherwise `ans[j]` is set to \(r\) and \(r\) is decremented. After processing all test cases, the function prints the contents of the `ans` array. This process ensures that the values in `ans` are alternately assigned based on the parity of the iteration index, starting from the left and right ends of the array. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, and for each test case, it processes integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
