`tc` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `m` remain their original values, the array `a` remains the same, and the constants `MOD`, `inv_2`, and `inv_3` also remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\), the array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(5 \cdot 10^8 + 4\), `inv_3` is \(3^{10^9 + 6} \pmod{10^9 + 7}\); `tc` is an input integer.**
