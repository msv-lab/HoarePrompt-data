The code updates the value of `expected_time` to \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\). The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \mod n] - a[i]) \mod m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, and `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `expected_time` is updated to \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\).
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` remains unchanged as the new `dist` is only used in the calculation of `expected_time`; `_` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `m` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `inv_m` remains unchanged; `dist` is now \((a[(i + 1) \mod n] - a[i]) \mod m\); `prob_last` is now `dist * inv_m % MOD`; `expected_getting_moved` is now `n * inv_2 % MOD`; `expected_time` is now \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD**.
