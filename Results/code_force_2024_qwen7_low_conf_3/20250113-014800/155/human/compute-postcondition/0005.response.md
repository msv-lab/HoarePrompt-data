The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on user input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\)
- The array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\)
- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `inv_2` is \(5 \cdot 10^8 + 4\)
- `inv_3` is \(3^{10^9 + 6} \pmod{10^9 + 7}\)
- `tc` must be at least 1

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `m` is an input integer satisfying \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\), the array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(5 \cdot 10^8 + 4\), `inv_3` is \(3^{10^9 + 6} \pmod{10^9 + 7}\), `tc` must be at least 1**
