The code calculates `prob_last` as `dist * inv_m % MOD`. The values of `dist` and `inv_m` are known from the initial state, while `prob_last` is newly calculated. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given:
- `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`
- `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`

Therefore, `prob_last` is calculated as:
\[ \text{prob_last} = (\text{dist} * \text{inv\_m}) \% \text{MOD} \]

Since the initial values of `ans`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `inv_m` remain unchanged, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is \((\text{dist} * \text{inv\_m}) \% \text{MOD}\)**
