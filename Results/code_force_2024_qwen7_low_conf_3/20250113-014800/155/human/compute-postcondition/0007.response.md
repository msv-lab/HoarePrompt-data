The code calculates the modular inverse of `m` using the formula \( m^{MOD-2} \mod MOD \). The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `MOD`, `inv_2`, and `inv_3` are not affected by this line of code.

The modular inverse of `m` is calculated as `inv_m`. Since `m` is an input integer and `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), the value of `inv_m` will be the modular inverse of `m` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `m` is an input integer satisfying \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\), the array `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(5 \cdot 10^8 + 4\), `inv_3` is \(3^{10^9 + 6} \pmod{10^9 + 7}\), `tc` must be at least 1, `inv_m` is \(m^{MOD-2} \mod MOD\)**
