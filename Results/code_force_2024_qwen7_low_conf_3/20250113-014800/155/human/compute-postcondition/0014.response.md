The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`. Let's break it down:

1. `prob_last` is defined as `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
2. `expected_getting_moved` is defined as `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
3. `expected_time` is defined as `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.

So, `ans += prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` translates to:

\[ \text{ans} += (\text{dist} * \text{inv\_m} \% \text{MOD}) * (\text{n} * \text{inv\_2} \% \text{MOD}) * ((\text{m} * \text{m} - \text{dist} * \text{dist}) * \text{inv\_3} \% \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} \]

Since the exact value of `ans` before this operation is not given, we can only express the updated value of `ans` in terms of the given variables.

Output State: **`dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD)`**
