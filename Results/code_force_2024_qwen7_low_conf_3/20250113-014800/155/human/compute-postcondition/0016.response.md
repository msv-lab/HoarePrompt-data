Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\)
   - `prob_last` is \(dist \times inv_m \% MOD\)
   - `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \% MOD\)
   - `expected_time` is \((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \% MOD\)
   - `ans` is \((ans + (prob_last \times expected_getting_moved \% MOD \times expected_time \% MOD)) \% MOD\)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` is `i`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

5. **Update the state:**
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - Since the formula for `dist` involves \((i + 1) \% n\), the term \(a[(i + 1) \% n]\) will change based on the new value of `i`.
   - All other variables (`prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`, and `ans`) remain unchanged until the next iteration of the loop.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - `dist` will be \((a[(i + 2) \% n] - a[(i + 1) \% n]) \% m\)
   - `prob_last` will be \(dist \times inv_m \% MOD\)
   - `expected_getting_moved` remains \(n \times inv_2 \% MOD\)
   - `expected_time` remains \((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \% MOD\)
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new values of `dist`, `prob_last`, and `expected_getting_moved`, but its exact value before the update is not needed for stating the conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`dist` is \((a[(i + 2) \% n] - a[(i + 1) \% n]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m \% MOD)\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is \((ans + (prob_last \times expected_getting_moved \% MOD \times expected_time \% MOD)) \% MOD\)**
