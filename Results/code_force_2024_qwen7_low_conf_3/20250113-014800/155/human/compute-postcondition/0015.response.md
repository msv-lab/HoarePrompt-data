The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` to `ans`. After this addition, the code then performs the modulo operation `% MOD` on `ans`. This means the new value of `ans` is the result of the modulo operation.

Given the initial state:
- `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`
- `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD)`

After the operations in the code snippet, `ans` is updated to the value of itself plus the result of the expression `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD`, and then `ans` is taken modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + (prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD)) % MOD`**
