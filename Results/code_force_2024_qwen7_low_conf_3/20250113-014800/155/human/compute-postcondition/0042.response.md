The code `ans += prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, all taken modulo `MOD`. Since the exact value of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` is known from the initial state, we can substitute those values.

From the initial state:
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`
- `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`

Substituting these into the code:
\[ ans += (dist * inv_m % MOD) * (n * inv_2 % MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD) % MOD \]

This simplifies the calculation but does not change the fact that `ans` is updated. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is 0 + (dist * inv_m % MOD) * (n * inv_2 % MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD) % MOD, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`, `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`**
