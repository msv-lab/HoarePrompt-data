`prob_last` is assigned the value of `dist * inv_m % MOD`. Here, `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`, and `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`. The values of `ans`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `inv_m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`, `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, and `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`, `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`**
