The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be `ans` modulo `MOD`. This means that `ans` is now the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. Since the initial state of `ans` is given as a specific formula, we need to apply this modulo operation.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + ((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * inv_m % MOD) * (n * inv_2 % MOD) * (((m * m - (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i])) * inv_3) % MOD) % MOD`

After applying the modulo operation:
- `ans` becomes `(ans + ((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * inv_m % MOD) * (n * inv_2 % MOD) * (((m * m - (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i])) * inv_3) % MOD) % MOD) % MOD`

This simplifies to:
- `ans` is now the remainder when the entire expression is divided by `MOD`.

The other variables remain unchanged in their initial states.

Output State: **`ans` is the remainder when (ans + ((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * inv_m % MOD) * (n * inv_2 % MOD) * (((m * m - (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i])) * inv_3) % MOD) % MOD) is divided by `MOD`; `dist` is (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m, `prob_last` is (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * inv_m % MOD, `expected_getting_moved` is n * inv_2 % MOD, `expected_time` is ((m * m - (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i])) * inv_3) % MOD, `_` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `inv_m` remains unchanged.**
