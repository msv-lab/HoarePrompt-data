The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to process a series of test cases where each test case includes three integers `t`, `n`, and `m`, and an array `a` of `n` distinct integers. However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, we need to infer the functionality based on the given constraints and output cases.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\).
- The array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

And considering the output cases provided, the function likely processes these inputs and returns a result based on the conditions specified.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `t`, `n`, and `m`, and an array `a` of `n` distinct integers. It then returns a result based on the specified conditions.**
