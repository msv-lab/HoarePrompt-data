`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `ans` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**
