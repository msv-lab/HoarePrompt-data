According to the code, the loop iterates `tc` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `ans` holds the sum of the contributions from each pair of consecutive elements in the array \( a \), considering the probabilities, expected values, and the modulo operation, with the final result being \( \text{ans} \mod \text{MOD} \). The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `ans` is the computed value after processing all pairs in the array \( a \) for the current test case.
- The loop has just completed one full iteration out of `tc` iterations.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to reset or adjust the state such that it starts the next iteration. This means:
- The loop counter `_` should be set to 0 for the next iteration.
- The value of `ans` will be recalculated in the next iteration based on the new values of the array \( a \).

Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ans` is 0, `_` is 0**
