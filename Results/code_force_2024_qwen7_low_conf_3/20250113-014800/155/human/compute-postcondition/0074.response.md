The code updates the value of `prob_last` by calculating `dist * inv_m % MOD`. The previous value of `prob_last` was `(dist * inv_m % MOD)`, which means the new value of `prob_last` is the same as its previous value because the line of code simply reassigns the same expression to `prob_last`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is \((\text{prob\_last} * \text{expected\_getting\_moved} * \text{expected\_time}) \% \text{MOD}\), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo \(\text{MOD}\), `dist` is \(((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) \% m)\), `prob_last` is \((\text{dist} * \text{inv\_m}) \% \text{MOD}\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n / 2 \% \text{MOD}\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - \text{dist} * \text{dist}) * \text{inv\_3} \% \text{MOD}\)**
