The code `expected_getting_moved = n * inv_2 % MOD` calculates the value of `expected_getting_moved` by multiplying `n` by `inv_2` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Here, `inv_2` is the modular inverse of 2 modulo `MOD`, which means \(inv_2 \cdot 2 \equiv 1 \mod MOD\). Therefore, `n * inv_2 % MOD` simplifies to `n / 2 % MOD` because multiplying by the modular inverse of 2 is equivalent to dividing by 2 in modular arithmetic.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `n / 2 % MOD` will be the integer division of `n` by 2, taken modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is \((\text{dist} * \text{inv\_m}) \% \text{MOD}\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n / 2 \% MOD\)**
