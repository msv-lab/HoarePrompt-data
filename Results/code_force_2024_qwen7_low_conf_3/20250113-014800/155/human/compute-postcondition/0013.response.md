The code updates the variable `expected_time` based on the given formula. Let's break it down:

- Initial State:
  - `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`
  - `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`
  - `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`

The new value of `expected_time` is calculated as:
\[ expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD \]

Since no other variables are affected, the output state will only include the updated value of `expected_time` and the unchanged values of `dist`, `prob_last`, and `expected_getting_moved`.

Output State: **`dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`**
