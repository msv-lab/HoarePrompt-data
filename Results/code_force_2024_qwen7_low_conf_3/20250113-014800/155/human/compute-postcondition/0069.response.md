The code updates the variable `expected_time` with the formula \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\). The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is the value of the second input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`
- `dist` is \((a[1] - a[0]) \% m\)
- `prob_last` is \((\text{dist} * \text{inv\_m}) \% \text{MOD}\)
- `expected_getting_moved` is \(n / 2 \% MOD\)

After executing the line `expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`, the new value of `expected_time` is calculated using the given formula, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`, `dist` is \((a[1] - a[0]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((\text{dist} * \text{inv\_m}) \% \text{MOD}\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n / 2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)**
