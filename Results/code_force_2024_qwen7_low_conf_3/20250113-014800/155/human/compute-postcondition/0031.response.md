The code snippet `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans`. Since the print statement does not modify the value of `ans` or any other variable, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the contributions from each pair of consecutive elements in the array \( a \), considering the probabilities, expected values, and the modulo operation, with the final result being \( \text{ans} \mod \text{MOD} \)**
