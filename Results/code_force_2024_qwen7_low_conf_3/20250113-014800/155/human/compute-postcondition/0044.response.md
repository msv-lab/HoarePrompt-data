Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is \(0 + (dist \times inv_m \% MOD) \times (n \times inv_2 \% MOD) \times ((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \% MOD) \% MOD\)
   - `_` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input
   - `inv_m` is \(pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)\)
   - `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\)
   - `prob_last` is \(dist \times inv_m \% MOD\)
   - `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \% MOD\)
   - `expected_time` is \((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \% MOD\)

2. **Loop Iteration Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for each `i` in `range(n)`.
   - Inside the loop, the following steps occur:
     - Calculate `dist` as \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\)
     - Update `prob_last` as \(dist \times inv_m \% MOD\)
     - Update `expected_getting_moved` as \(n \times inv_2 \% MOD\)
     - Update `expected_time` as \((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \% MOD\)
     - The value of `dist` changes with each iteration.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will become `0`.
   - Since `i` wraps around using modulo operation (`i = (i + 1) \% n`), the new `i` will be 0.
   - The value of `dist` will change based on the new `i`.

4. **Updated States:**
   - `ans` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `_` remains 0 as it is not used or updated inside the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `m` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `a` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `inv_m` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `dist` will now be \((a[1] - a[0]) \% m\) if `n > 1`.
   - `prob_last` will be updated to the new `dist \times inv_m \% MOD`.
   - `expected_getting_moved` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `expected_time` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`ans` is 0 + (dist \* inv_m \% MOD) \* (n \* inv_2 \% MOD) \* ((m \* m - dist \* dist) \* inv_3 \% MOD) \% MOD, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `inv_m` is pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD), `dist` is (a[1] - a[0]) \% m, `prob_last` is dist \* inv_m \% MOD, `expected_getting_moved` is n \* inv_2 \% MOD, `expected_time` is (m \* m - dist \* dist) \* inv_3 \% MOD**
