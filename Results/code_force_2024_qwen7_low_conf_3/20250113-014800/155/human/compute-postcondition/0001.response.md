The code assigns the value of `(MOD + 1) // 2` to the variable `inv_2`. Since `MOD` is `10^9 + 7`, the value of `inv_2` is calculated as `(10^9 + 7 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `5 * 10^8 + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, the array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ `m` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ `n`, and `MOD` is 10^9 + 7; `inv_2` is 5 * 10^8 + 4**
