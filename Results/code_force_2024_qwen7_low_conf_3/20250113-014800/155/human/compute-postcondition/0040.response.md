The code sets `expected_getting_moved` to `n * inv_2 % MOD`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. The output state includes the updated value of `expected_getting_moved` and retains the values of the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`, `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`**
