`prob_last` is assigned the value of `dist * inv_m % MOD`. The value of `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, and `inv_m` and `MOD` are unchanged. Therefore, `prob_last` is calculated using these values.

Output State: **`dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`**
