The code `ans = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`**
