Output State: **`ans` is the remainder when the summation of (prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time) % MOD over all iterations is divided by MOD, `i` is n, `_` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `inv_m` remains unchanged, where prob_last is (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * inv_m % MOD, expected_getting_moved is n * inv_2 % MOD, expected_time is (m * m - (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) * (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i])) * inv_3 % MOD.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, updating the value of `ans` in each iteration.
- Each iteration calculates `dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` based on the current index `i`.
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` to the current value of `ans` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments by 1 each time.
- The variables `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `inv_m` do not change during the loop execution and retain their original values.
