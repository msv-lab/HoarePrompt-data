The code `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the value of `ans` modulo `MOD`. Therefore, the value of `ans` after this operation is the same as its value before the operation.

The values of the other variables (`dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `inv_m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the remainder when \((\text{ans} + (\text{prob\_last} \times \text{expected\_getting\_moved} \times \text{expected\_time}) \% \text{MOD})\) is divided by `\text{MOD}`, `dist` is \((\text{a}[(i + 1) \% n] - \text{a}[i]) \% \text{m}\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is \((\text{m} \times \text{m} - \text{dist} \times \text{dist}) \times \text{inv\_3} \% \text{MOD}`, `_` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `inv_m` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to be the remainder when itself is divided by `MOD`.**
