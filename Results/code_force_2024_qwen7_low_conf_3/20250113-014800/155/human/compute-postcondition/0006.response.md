The code `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and sorts the resulting list. 

- `t`, `n`, `m`, `MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`, and `tc` are not affected by this operation.
- The input `input().split()` expects a sequence of space-separated integers which are then converted to integers and sorted.

Since the exact input values are not specified, we represent the sorted list `a` as a sorted version of the input integers. The output state will include the fact that `a` is now a sorted list of integers, and the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `m` is an input integer satisfying \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\), the array `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(5 \cdot 10^8 + 4\), `inv_3` is \(3^{10^9 + 6} \pmod{10^9 + 7}\), `tc` must be at least 1**.
