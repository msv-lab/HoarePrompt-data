The code calculates `expected_time` using the formula `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`. Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. `expected_time` is assigned the value `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.
2. `m` and `inv_m` are known, but `dist` and `inv_3` are used in the calculation.

Given:
- `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`.
- `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`.
- `inv_3` is `pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD)` since `inv_3` is the modular inverse of 3.

The calculation for `expected_time` is specific and does not affect other variables directly. Therefore, the only updated variable is `expected_time`.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `inv_m` is `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`, `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`**
