The code `expected_getting_moved = n * inv_2 % MOD` updates the value of `expected_getting_moved`. The original value of `expected_getting_moved` was \(n \times \text{inv\_2} \% \text{MOD}\), and now it is being re-assigned to \(n \times \text{inv\_2} \% \text{MOD}\). Since this is just a re-assignment, the value remains the same.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((\text{dist} \times \text{inv\_m} \% \text{MOD})^2\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times \text{inv\_2} \% \text{MOD}\); `expected_time` is \((\text{m} \times \text{m} - \text{dist} \times \text{dist}) \times \text{inv\_3} \% \text{MOD}\); `ans` is \(\text{ans} \% \text{MOD}\); `i` is \(\text{current value of } i + 1\)**
