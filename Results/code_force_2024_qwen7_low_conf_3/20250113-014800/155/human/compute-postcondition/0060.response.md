Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State
- `ans` is the remainder when the summation of \((\text{prob\_last} \times \text{expected\_getting\_moved} \times \text{expected\_time}) \% \text{MOD}\) over all iterations is divided by \(\text{MOD}\).
- `i` is `n`.
- `_` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `inv_m` remains unchanged.
- \(\text{prob\_last} = (\text{a}[(i + 1) \% \text{n}] - \text{a}[i]) \times \text{inv\_m} \% \text{MOD}\)
- \(\text{expected\_getting\_moved} = \text{n} \times \text{inv\_2} \% \text{MOD}\)
- \(\text{expected\_time} = (\text{m} \times \text{m} - (\text{a}[(i + 1) \% \text{n}] - \text{a}[i]) \times (\text{a}[(i + 1) \% \text{n}] - \text{a}[i])) \times \text{inv\_3} \% \text{MOD}\)

### Loop Condition
The loop condition for the given `for` loop is `for _ in range(tc)`. This means the loop will run `tc` times.

### End of Previous Iteration
- The loop has just completed one iteration, meaning `i` was incremented by 1 from its initial value of `n`.
- Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now `n + 1`.

### New State
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `tc`. Since `i` is now `n + 1`, we need to check if `n + 1 < tc`.

If `n + 1 < tc`, then the loop can continue. The other variables remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

### Final State
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now `n + 1`.
- `_` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `inv_m` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ans` is the remainder when the summation of \((\text{prob\_last} \times \text{expected\_getting\_moved} \times \text{expected\_time}) \% \text{MOD}\) over all iterations is divided by \(\text{MOD}\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `_` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `inv_m` remains unchanged, where \(\text{prob\_last} = (\text{a}[(i + 1) \% \text{n}] - \text{a}[i]) \times \text{inv\_m} \% \text{MOD}\), \(\text{expected\_getting\_moved} = \text{n} \times \text{inv\_2} \% \text{MOD}\), \(\text{expected\_time} = (\text{m} \times \text{m} - (\text{a}[(i + 1) \% \text{n}] - \text{a}[i]) \times (\text{a}[(i + 1) \% \text{n}] - \text{a}[i])) \times \text{inv\_3} \% \text{MOD}\).**
