The given code snippet calculates the modular inverse of `m` using the `pow` function with the formula `inv_m = pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`. This means that `inv_m` is now the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Calculate `inv_m`: `inv_m` is assigned the value of `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`.
2. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `i`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or any other variables.

Therefore, the only change is in the value of `inv_m`, which is now the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`ans` is the remainder when the summation of \((\text{prob\_last} \times \text{expected\_getting\_moved} \times \text{expected\_time}) \% \text{MOD}\) over all iterations is divided by \text{MOD}\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `_` remains unchanged, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `m` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`.**
