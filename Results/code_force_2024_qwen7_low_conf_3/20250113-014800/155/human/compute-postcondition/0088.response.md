Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` for each iteration, all taken modulo `MOD`; `i` is `n`; `n` is the value of the first input integer; `m` is the value of the second input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`; the loop will execute at least `tc` times if `tc` is a positive integer, otherwise `ans` remains `0`.**
