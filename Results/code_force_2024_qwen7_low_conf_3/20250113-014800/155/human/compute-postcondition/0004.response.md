Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Requirements:**
   - `tc`: This is the number of times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `tc` must be at least 1.
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`: These variables do not directly affect whether the loop executes, but they must be as specified to ensure the correctness of the loop body.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `for _ in range(tc)`, which means the loop will run `tc` times. Therefore, `tc` must be a positive integer and at least 1.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `tc` is the only variable that directly controls the loop execution, we need to ensure that `tc` is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state before the first execution of the loop should be adjusted to ensure `tc` is at least 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\), the array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(5 \cdot 10^8 + 4\), `inv_3` is \(3^{10^9 + 6} \pmod{10^9 + 7}\); `tc` must be at least 1**.
