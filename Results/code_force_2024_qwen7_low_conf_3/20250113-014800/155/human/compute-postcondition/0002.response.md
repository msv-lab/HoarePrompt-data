The code snippet calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of 3 under modulo `MOD`. The expression used is `pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD)`, which computes the inverse. Given that `MOD` is defined as `10^9 + 7`, the value of `inv_3` will be the result of this computation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\)
- The array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\)
- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `inv_2` is \(5 \cdot 10^8 + 4\)

After executing the line:
```python
inv_3 = pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD)
```

The value of `inv_3` will be the modular multiplicative inverse of 3 under modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This means:
\[ 3 \cdot inv_3 \equiv 1 \pmod{10^9 + 7} \]

Therefore, the value of `inv_3` can be computed as:
\[ inv_3 = 3^{10^9 + 6} \pmod{10^9 + 7} \]

Since the exact value of `inv_3` is not trivial to compute manually, it's best to leave it in this form unless specified otherwise.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\), the array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(5 \cdot 10^8 + 4\), `inv_3` is \(3^{10^9 + 6} \pmod{10^9 + 7}\)**
