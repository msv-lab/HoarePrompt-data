The code snippet defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or the array `a`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the constant `MOD`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, the array `a` contains `n` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ `m` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ `n`, and `MOD` is 10^9 + 7.**
