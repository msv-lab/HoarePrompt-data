The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `mod`, where `x` and `mod` are coprime and satisfy the condition `1 < x < mod`. It returns the modular multiplicative inverse of `x` modulo `mod`, which is calculated as \( \text{pow}(x, (mod - 2), mod) \). This inverse exists because `x` and `mod` are coprime, ensuring that `x` has an inverse modulo `mod`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that the inputs meet the specified conditions. If these conditions are not met, the behavior is undefined.
