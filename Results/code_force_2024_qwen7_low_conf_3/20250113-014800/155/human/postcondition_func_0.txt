The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer `tc` representing the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m`, and an array `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on specific mathematical operations involving the given integers and their properties. The operations include calculating distances, probabilities, and expected values, all taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. The final `ans` for each test case is printed. If no test cases are provided (`tc` is zero), `ans` remains `0`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases `tc`.
2. For each test case, reads `n` and `m`.
3. Reads the array `a` of `n` distinct integers.
4. Calculates the modular inverse of `m` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
5. Iterates over the elements of `a` to compute `dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`.
6. Updates `ans` with the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, all taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.
7. Prints the final `ans` for each test case.

Potential edge cases:
- If `tc` is `0`, no test cases are processed, and `ans` remains `0`.
- If `n` is `0`, the array `a` will be empty, and the loop will not execute, leaving `ans` unchanged.
- If `m` is `1`, the distance calculations will result in `0`, and `prob_last` will also be `0`, making the contributions to `ans` negligible.
- If `a` contains duplicate integers, the function will treat them as distinct due to the requirement that `a` contains `n` distinct integers.
