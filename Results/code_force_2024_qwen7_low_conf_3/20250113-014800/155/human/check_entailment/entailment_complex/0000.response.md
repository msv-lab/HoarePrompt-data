Reasoning:
1. The annotated program accurately describes the logic of the given code. The code processes each test case correctly according to the problem statement.
2. The variables and their roles are clearly defined:
   - `MOD`: The modulus used for all arithmetic operations, \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `inv_2` and `inv_3`: Modular inverses used in calculations.
   - `tc`: Number of test cases.
   - `n` and `m`: Number of balls and baskets respectively.
   - `a`: Sorted list of initial positions of balls.
   - `inv_m`: Modulo inverse of `m`.
   - `ans`: Accumulates the expected time for each test case.
3. The loop iterates over each ball, calculating the distance, probability, and expected time correctly based on the given formulas.
4. The final `ans` is calculated correctly by summing up the products of the relevant terms and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
5. The code handles edge cases appropriately, such as when `tc` is zero or `n` is zero.

Given that the annotated program matches the functionality of the given code and accurately describes its behavior, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and example.

Correctness: **True**
