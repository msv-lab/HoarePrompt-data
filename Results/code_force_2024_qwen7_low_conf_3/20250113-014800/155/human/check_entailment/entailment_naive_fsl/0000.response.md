Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial positions of the balls form a cycle. In such cases, the expected time calculation might be incorrect. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 6
1 2 3
```

In this case, the balls are initially in a cycle (1 -> 2 -> 3), and the program might not correctly calculate the expected time to reduce the number of balls to one. The current implementation assumes a random selection and movement strategy but does not account for the cyclic nature of the basket arrangement, leading to potential incorrect results.
