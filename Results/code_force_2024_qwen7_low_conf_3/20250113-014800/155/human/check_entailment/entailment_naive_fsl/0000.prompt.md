You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: [Rammstein - Ausländer](https://youtu.be/3eEA6H_y1VI)

ඞ

There are m baskets placed along a circle, numbered from 1 to m in clockwise
order (basket m is next to basket 1 ). Furthermore, there are n balls, where
ball i is initially placed in basket a_i , and no basket contains more than
one ball.

Alice is allowed to perform the following operation, which always takes
exactly one second whether you move/throw a ball or not:

  * Alice chooses an integer i between 1 and n uniformly at random. 
  * If ball i was thrown away before, do nothing. 
  * Otherwise, ball i is moved from the basket currently containing it to the next basket (in clockwise order). If the target basket currently contains another ball j , throw ball j away. 

She repeats this operation until there is exactly one ball left. Calculate the
expected time needed (in seconds) for Alice to end the process.

It can be proven that the answer can be represented as a rational number
\frac{p}{q} with coprime p and q . You need to output p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod
10^9 + 7 . It can be proven that 10^9 + 7 \nmid q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5, n \le m \le 10^9 ) — the number of balls and the number of
baskets.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le m , a_i 's are pairwise distinct) — the initial position of each
ball.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the expected amount of time (in
seconds) Alice needs to end the process, modulo 10^9 + 7 .

    3 10
    
    5 1 4
    
    2 15

    6 9
    
    6 5 4 3 2 1

Output

    600000042
    14
    35
    333333409
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice could have proceeded as follows (we define a_i =
-1 if ball i has been thrown out):

  * Initially, a = [5, 1, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 2 . After this, a = [5, 2, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 3 . After this, a = [5, 3, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 4 . As basket 4 previously contains ball 3 , this ball is thrown out. After this, a = [5, 4, -1] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 3 with probability \frac{1}{3} . Ball 3 has already been thrown out, so nothing happens. After this, a = [5, 4, -1] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 5 , which throws out ball 1 . After this, a = [-1, 5, -1] , and the process ends. 

The answer for this test case is \frac{189}{5} .

The answer for the second test case is 14 (note that these two balls are next
to each other).

The answer for the third test case is 35 .

The answer for the fourth test case is \frac{220}{3} .

In the fifth test case, as there is only one ball initially, the answer is 0 .
Program:
```
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    inv_2 = (MOD + 1) // 2
    inv_3 = pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD)
    tc = int(input())
    for _ in range(tc):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        inv_m = pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            dist = (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m
            prob_last = dist * inv_m % MOD
            expected_getting_moved = n * inv_2 % MOD
            expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD
            ans += prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD
            ans %= MOD
        print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
