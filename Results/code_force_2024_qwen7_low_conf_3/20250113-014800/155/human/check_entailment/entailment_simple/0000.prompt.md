You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: [Rammstein - Ausländer](https://youtu.be/3eEA6H_y1VI)

ඞ

There are m baskets placed along a circle, numbered from 1 to m in clockwise
order (basket m is next to basket 1 ). Furthermore, there are n balls, where
ball i is initially placed in basket a_i , and no basket contains more than
one ball.

Alice is allowed to perform the following operation, which always takes
exactly one second whether you move/throw a ball or not:

  * Alice chooses an integer i between 1 and n uniformly at random. 
  * If ball i was thrown away before, do nothing. 
  * Otherwise, ball i is moved from the basket currently containing it to the next basket (in clockwise order). If the target basket currently contains another ball j , throw ball j away. 

She repeats this operation until there is exactly one ball left. Calculate the
expected time needed (in seconds) for Alice to end the process.

It can be proven that the answer can be represented as a rational number
\frac{p}{q} with coprime p and q . You need to output p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod
10^9 + 7 . It can be proven that 10^9 + 7 \nmid q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5, n \le m \le 10^9 ) — the number of balls and the number of
baskets.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le m , a_i 's are pairwise distinct) — the initial position of each
ball.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the expected amount of time (in
seconds) Alice needs to end the process, modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, Alice could have proceeded as follows (we define a_i =
-1 if ball i has been thrown out):

  * Initially, a = [5, 1, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 2 . After this, a = [5, 2, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 3 . After this, a = [5, 3, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 4 . As basket 4 previously contains ball 3 , this ball is thrown out. After this, a = [5, 4, -1] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 3 with probability \frac{1}{3} . Ball 3 has already been thrown out, so nothing happens. After this, a = [5, 4, -1] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 5 , which throws out ball 1 . After this, a = [-1, 5, -1] , and the process ends. 

The answer for this test case is \frac{189}{5} .

The answer for the second test case is 14 (note that these two balls are next
to each other).

The answer for the third test case is 35 .

The answer for the fourth test case is \frac{220}{3} .

In the fifth test case, as there is only one ball initially, the answer is 0 .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9. The array a contains n distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    inv_2 = (MOD + 1) // 2
    inv_3 = pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD)
    tc = int(input())
    for _ in range(tc):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        inv_m = pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            dist = (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m
            prob_last = dist * inv_m % MOD
            expected_getting_moved = n * inv_2 % MOD
            expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD
            ans += prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD
            ans %= MOD
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the sum of the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` for each iteration, all taken modulo `MOD`; `i` is `n`; `n` is the value of the first input integer; `m` is the value of the second input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`; the loop will execute at least `tc` times if `tc` is a positive integer, otherwise `ans` remains `0`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
