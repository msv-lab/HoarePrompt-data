### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We have \( n \) balls and \( m \) baskets arranged in a circle.
- Balls are initially placed in distinct baskets.
- Alice performs an operation repeatedly:
  - Chooses a ball at random.
  - Moves the ball to the next basket.
  - Throws the ball away if the next basket contains another ball.
- The goal is to calculate the expected time until only one ball remains, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    inv_2 = (MOD + 1) // 2
    inv_3 = pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD)
    tc = int(input())
    for _ in range(tc):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        inv_m = pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            dist = (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m
            prob_last = dist * inv_m % MOD
            expected_getting_moved = n * inv_2 % MOD
            expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD
            ans += prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD
            ans %= MOD
        print(ans)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), then reads the positions of the balls.
- It calculates the expected time using modular inverses and the given formulas.
- The result is printed for each test case.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( n \), \( m \), and the positions of the balls.
   - The positions are sorted, but sorting is unnecessary since the algorithm only depends on the relative positions.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - `dist = (a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m` correctly calculates the distance between consecutive balls.
   - This calculation ensures that the distance wraps around the circle correctly.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - `prob_last = dist * inv_m % MOD` calculates the probability that a ball is the last one in its position.
   - This is a critical part of the expected time calculation.

4. **Expected Time Calculation**:
   - `expected_getting_moved = n * inv_2 % MOD`: This represents the expected number of moves until a ball gets moved.
   - `expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`: This calculates the expected time for a ball to move to the next position.

5. **Accumulation and Modulo Operations**:
   - The overall expected time is accumulated and printed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Edge Cases:
- **Zero Test Cases**: If `tc` is `0`, the program correctly prints `0`.
- **Zero Balls**: If `n` is `0`, the program will not enter the loop, leaving `ans` unchanged as `0`.
- **Single Basket**: If `m` is `1`, the distance calculation will result in `0`, and `prob_last` will also be `0`, making the contributions to `ans` negligible.
- **Duplicate Integers**: Since the problem specifies distinct integers in `a`, the program will handle this correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately calculates the expected time using the given formulas and handles all necessary edge cases.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
