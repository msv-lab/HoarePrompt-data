The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000 for each i, and the sum of all elements in `a` does not exceed 5000. It iterates over all possible subsets of the list `a` using bit masking. For each subset, it finds the maximum value among the elements whose corresponding bit in the subset's bitmask is set to 1. It then sums these maximum values and returns the result modulo 998244353. The function handles all possible subsets of the list `a`, including the empty subset, which contributes a value of 0 to the sum. There are no missing functionalities in the given code, and the postcondition accurately reflects the state of the program after the function executes.
