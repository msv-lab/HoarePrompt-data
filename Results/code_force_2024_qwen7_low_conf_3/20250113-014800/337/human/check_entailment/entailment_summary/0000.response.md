Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to accept two parameters: `n` (number of colors) and `a` (list of integers representing the number of balls of each color).
2. **Modulo Operation**: The variable `MOD` is set to 998244353, ensuring that the final result is taken modulo this value.
3. **Bitmask Iteration**: The outer loop iterates over all possible subsets of the list `a` using bit masking (`range(1 << n)`). This ensures that every possible combination of colors is considered.
4. **Maximum Calculation**: For each subset represented by the bitmask `mask`, the inner loop checks which colors are included in the subset and calculates the maximum number of balls among those colors.
5. **Summation**: The total value is updated by adding the maximum value for each subset, and the result is taken modulo 998244353 to handle large numbers.
6. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed total value.

Given the execution summary and the logical structure of the code, the program correctly computes the required sum of values over all 2^n possible sets of colors. Therefore, the provided implementation matches the problem requirements and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
