You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
There are balls of n different colors; the number of balls of the i -th color
is a_i .

The balls can be combined into groups. Each group should contain at most 2
balls, and no more than 1 ball of each color.

Consider all 2^n sets of colors. For a set of colors, let's denote its value
as the minimum number of groups the balls of those colors can be distributed
into. For example, if there are three colors with 3 , 1 and 7 balls
respectively, they can be combined into 7 groups (and not less than 7 ), so
the value of that set of colors is 7 .

Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all 2^n possible sets of
colors. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) — the number of
colors.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 5000 )
— the number of balls of the i -th color.

Additional constraint on input: the total number of balls doesn't exceed 5000
.

Output

Print a single integer — the sum of values of all 2^n sets of colors, taken
modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

Consider the first example. There are 8 sets of colors:

  * for the empty set, its value is 0 ; 
  * for the set \\{1\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{2,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2,3\\} , its value is 2 . 

So, the sum of values over all 2^n sets of colors is 11 .

# Program:
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = func_1(n, a)
print(result)

def func_1(n, a):
    MOD = 998244353
    total_value = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        max_balls = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & 1 << i != 0:
                max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])
        total_value = (total_value + max_balls) % MOD
    return total_value





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000 for each i, and the sum of all elements in `a` does not exceed 5000. It iterates over all possible subsets of the list `a` using bit masking. For each subset, it finds the maximum value among the elements whose corresponding bit in the subset's bitmask is set to 1. It then sums these maximum values and returns the result modulo 998244353. The function handles all possible subsets of the list `a`, including the empty subset, which contributes a value of 0 to the sum. There are no missing functionalities in the given code, and the postcondition accurately reflects the state of the program after the function executes.
