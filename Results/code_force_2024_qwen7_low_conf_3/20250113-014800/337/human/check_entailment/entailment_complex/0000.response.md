Reasoning: 
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of values over all \(2^n\) possible sets of colors, modulo \(998,244,353\). Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input and initializes variables correctly.
2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` uses bit masking to iterate through all possible subsets of the list `a`. This is done efficiently using the expression `range(1 << n)`, which generates all numbers from 0 to \(2^n - 1\).
   - For each subset represented by `mask`, it checks which elements of `a` belong to that subset using the condition `if mask & 1 << i != 0`. If the i-th bit of `mask` is set, it means the i-th element of `a` is included in the subset.
   - It calculates the maximum number of balls for the current subset and adds this value to `total_value`.
   - Finally, it returns the computed `total_value` modulo \(998,244,353\).

Given the problem constraints and the implementation, the function correctly computes the required sum. The provided example outputs also match the expected results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
