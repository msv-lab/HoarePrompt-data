Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of colors `n` and the number of balls for each color from the input. This part matches the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function calculates the sum of the values of all possible subsets of the set of colors. The function uses bitwise operations to iterate over all possible subsets (using `range(1 << n)`).

3. **Subset Calculation**: For each subset represented by `mask`, the function determines the maximum number of balls among the selected colors. This is done using a nested loop that checks the bits of `mask`.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The function ensures that the result is taken modulo `998244353` as required by the problem description.

5. **Output**: The function returns the calculated sum, which is printed out.

The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem statement, including:
- Considering all \(2^n\) possible sets of colors.
- Calculating the value for each set as the minimum number of groups needed.
- Summing these values and taking the result modulo \(998244353\).

Thus, the program accurately follows the problem description for every potential case within the given constraints.
