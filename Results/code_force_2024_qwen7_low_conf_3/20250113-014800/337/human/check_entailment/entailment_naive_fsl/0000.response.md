Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It calculates the sum of values for all \(2^n\) possible sets of colors by iterating through all possible subsets (using bitmasking) and determining the maximum number of balls of any single color in each subset. This maximum number of balls in a subset represents the minimum number of groups needed to distribute the balls of those colors. The program then sums these values and returns the result modulo \(998\,244\,353\).

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Each subset is evaluated correctly, and the maximum number of balls of any single color in each subset is used to compute the required value. The final summation and modulo operation ensure that the result fits within the specified constraints.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for all possible inputs within the given constraints, it is deemed correct.
