Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total_value` is 0.
   - `max_balls` is `max(0, a_0)`.
   - `i` is 0.
   
2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `mask & (1 << i) != 0`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `total_value` remains 0.
   - `max_balls` remains `max(0, a_0)`.
   - `i` is now some value that satisfies the loop condition.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is such that `mask & (1 << i) != 0`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and checked again against the loop condition.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - We need to check if the new `i` still satisfies the condition `mask & (1 << i) != 0`. If it does, the loop will continue; otherwise, it will terminate.

Given the information, let's adjust the states:

- `total_value` remains 0 because the loop body is omitted, and no operations affecting `total_value` are specified.
- `max_balls` remains `max(0, a_0)` because the loop body is omitted, and no operations affecting `max_balls` are specified.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

We need to ensure that the new `i` still satisfies the loop condition. Therefore, we will assume that `i + 1` still satisfies the condition (since we don't have the exact value of `i`, but we know the loop continued).

State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is `max(0, a_0)`, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

To provide a concrete answer, let's assume `i` was 0 before the increment. Then `i` becomes 1.

State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is `max(0, a_0)`, and `i` is 1**.

If the condition `mask & (1 << 1) != 0` holds true, the loop will continue. If it does not, the loop will terminate.
