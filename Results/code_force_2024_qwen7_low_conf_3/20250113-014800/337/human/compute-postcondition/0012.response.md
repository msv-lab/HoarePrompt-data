The code updates the value of `max_balls` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, the new value of `max_balls` will be the maximum of the current `max_balls` and `a[3]`. The initial state is that `total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `i` is 3, and `n` must be at least 1. After executing the code, `max_balls` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[3]`.

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is the maximum of `max_balls` and `a[3]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 1**
