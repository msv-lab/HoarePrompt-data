The code updates the value of `max_balls` to be the maximum value between the current `max_balls` and `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `max_balls` is set to be the maximum value between `max_balls` and `a[i]` if `a[i] > 0`. Since `i` is `i + 2`, this means that `i` has been updated to its new value.

Output State: **`total_value` is `total_value % MOD`, `max_balls` is the maximum value between `max_balls` and `a[i]`, and `i` is `i + 2`**
