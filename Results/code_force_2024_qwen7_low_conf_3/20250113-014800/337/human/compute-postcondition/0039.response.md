According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `total_value` is `total_value % MOD`
- `max_balls` is the maximum value between `max_balls` and `a[i]` if `a[i] > 0`
- `i` is `i + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next value. Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `i + 2` (since it was already incremented once).

State: **`total_value` is `total_value % MOD`, `max_balls` is the maximum value between `max_balls` and `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 0`), and `i` is `i + 2`**
