Postcondition: ***`total_value` is total_value % MOD, `max_balls` is the maximum value between `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 0`) and 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. This condition holds because if `mask & 1 << i` is not 0, `max_balls` is updated to `a[i]` if `a[i] > 0`, otherwise it remains 0; if `mask & 1 << i` is 0, `max_balls` does not change.***
