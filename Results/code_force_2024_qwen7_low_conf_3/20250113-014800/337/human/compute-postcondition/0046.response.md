The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000 for each i, and the sum of all elements in `a` does not exceed 5000. After executing the function body, the function returns `total_value`, which is the sum of the maximum values for each possible subset of the list `a`, modulo 998244353.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers, and return the sum of the maximum values for each possible subset of `a`, modulo 998244353.
