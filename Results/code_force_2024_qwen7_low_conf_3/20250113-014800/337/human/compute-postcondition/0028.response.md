Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is the maximum of `max(0, a_0)`, `a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` if the loop executes, otherwise `max_balls` is 0, and `i` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of iterations specified by the range function (`range(n)`).
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
3. **Variable `max_balls`**:
   - Initially, `max_balls` is set to 0.
   - During each iteration, if the condition `mask & 1 << i != 0` is true, `max_balls` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`.
   - If the condition is false, `max_balls` remains unchanged.
4. **Final State**:
   - If the loop executes (i.e., `mask` has at least one bit set in the range of `n`), `max_balls` will be the maximum value among `a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]` that satisfy the condition `mask & 1 << i != 0`.
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `mask` has no bits set in the range of `n`), `max_balls` remains 0.

Given this analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is as described above.
