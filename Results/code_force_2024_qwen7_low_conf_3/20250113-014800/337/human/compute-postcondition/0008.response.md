According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `total_value` is 0
- `max_balls` is `a[0]`
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be at least 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Additionally, `n` must still be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

Since the condition in the if part (checking if `mask & (1 << i)` is not equal to 0) does not affect the continuation of the loop itself, we only need to focus on the values of `i` and `n`.

State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
