The code updates `max_balls` to be the maximum between `max_balls` and `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `max_balls` is currently 0, and `i` is 0. The value of `a[0]` is not explicitly given, but we know that the condition `mask << i != 0` holds true, which implies that `a[0]` is non-zero.

Let's denote the value of `a[0]` as `a_0`. Since `a_0` is non-zero and `max_balls` is initially 0, `max_balls` will be updated to `a_0`.

The states of the other variables (`total_value`, `i`, `n`, and `mask`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, and the mask and 1 shifted left by `i` bits is not equal to 0**
