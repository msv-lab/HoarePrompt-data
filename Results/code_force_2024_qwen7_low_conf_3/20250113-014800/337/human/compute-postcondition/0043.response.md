The code updates `total_value` by adding `max_balls` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The values of `max_balls` and `MOD` are unchanged, and `i` is updated to `n`.

Let's denote the updated `total_value` as `new_total_value`.

- The original `total_value` is given as `total_value % MOD`.
- After updating, `total_value` becomes `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`.

Therefore, the new value of `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`.

Output State: **`total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`, `max_balls` is the maximum value found in the array `a` for indices where the corresponding bit in `mask` is set to 1, and `i` is `n`.**
