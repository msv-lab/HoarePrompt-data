The code assigns `0` to `max_balls`. This means that the value of `max_balls` is now `0`. The initial value of `total_value` is `max_balls % MOD`, which implies that `total_value` was initially `0 % MOD` (since `max_balls` was set to `0`). The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is 0, `i` is 0**
