The code snippet updates the value of `max_balls` by comparing it with `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is only considered if it is greater than 0, and the current value of `max_balls` is the maximum value between `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 0`) and 0, the new value of `max_balls` will be the maximum of the current `max_balls` and `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 0`). The `total_value` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_value` is `total_value % MOD`, `max_balls` is the maximum value between `max_balls` and `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 0`), and `i` is `i + 1`**
