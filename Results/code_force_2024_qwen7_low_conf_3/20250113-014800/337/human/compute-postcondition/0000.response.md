The code assigns the value `998244353` to the variable `MOD`. This is a constant value and does not depend on the initial values of `n` or the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 5000 for each i, and the sum of all elements in `a` does not exceed 5000; `MOD` is 998244353**
