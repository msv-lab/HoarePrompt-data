Output State: **`total_value` is `total_value % MOD`, `max_balls` is the maximum value found in the array `a` for indices where the corresponding bit in `mask` is set to 1, and `i` is `n`**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each index `i`, if the corresponding bit in `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << i` is not 0), `max_balls` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, since the loop increments `i` each time and runs `n` times.
- The value of `total_value` remains unchanged and is always taken modulo `MOD` due to the initial state and the fact that no operations modify it within the loop.
- `max_balls` will contain the maximum value among all `a[i]` where the corresponding bit in `mask` is set to 1. If no such bits are set, `max_balls` will remain 0.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is that `total_value` is `total_value % MOD`, `max_balls` is the maximum value found in the array `a` for indices where the corresponding bit in `mask` is set to 1, and `i` is `n`.
