`max_balls` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`. The initial value of `max_balls` is `max(0, a_0)` and `a[1]`. The updated value of `max_balls` will be the maximum of these two values and `a[2]`.

Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of `a_0`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, we can only express `max_balls` in terms of these values. The output state is:

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is the maximum of `max(0, a_0)`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, `i` is 3**
