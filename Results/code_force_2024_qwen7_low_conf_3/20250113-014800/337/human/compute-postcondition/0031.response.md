The code sets `max_balls` to 0, which means the value of `max_balls` is now 0. The values of `total_value` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.

- `total_value` is \((0 + \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\), and since `max_balls` is now 0, this simplifies to \(\text{total\_value} \% \text{MOD}\).
- `max_balls` is set to 0.
- `i` remains \(n\).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total_value` is \(\text{total\_value} \% \text{MOD}\), `max_balls` is 0, `i` is \(n\)**
