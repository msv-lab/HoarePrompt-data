The variable `max_balls` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment initializes `max_balls` without changing the values of `n`, `a`, `MOD`, or `total_value`. The conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a_i <= 5000` for each `i`, the sum of all elements in `a` does not exceed 5000, `MOD` is 998244353, `total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is 0**
