`max_balls` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value (`max(0, a_0)`) and `a[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. The state of `total_value` and `i` remains unchanged. 

Since the initial value of `max_balls` is `max(0, a_0)`, after executing the line `max_balls = max(max_balls, a[1])`, `max_balls` will be the maximum of `max(0, a_0)` and `a[1]`.

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is the maximum of `max(0, a_0)` and `a[1]`, `i` is 1**
