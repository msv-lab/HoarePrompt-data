The code `max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])` updates the value of `max_balls` to be the maximum between its current value and `a[i]`. Given that the condition `(`mask & 1 << i`)` is not 0, it means that the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `mask` is set (i.e., it is 1). However, the value of `a[i]` is not provided, and neither is the value of `max_balls` before the operation. The only information we have is that `max_balls` was initially 0.

Let's denote the value of `a[i]` as `a_i`. After the line of code is executed, `max_balls` will be updated to be the maximum of 0 and `a_i`. Therefore, `max_balls` will become `a_i` if `a_i > 0`, otherwise it will remain 0.

Output State: **`total_value` is total_value % MOD, `max_balls` is `a[i]` if `a[i] > 0` else 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of (`mask & 1 << i`) is not 0**
