To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider what variables and their values are required to enter the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over all possible subsets of the list `a` using a bitmask (`mask`).
   - The range `range(1 << n)` generates all integers from `1` to `2^n - 1`, where `2^n` is the total number of subsets (including the empty set).

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 5000`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a_i <= 5000` for each `i`.
   - The sum of all elements in `a` does not exceed 5000.
   - `MOD` is `998244353`.
   - `total_value` is `0`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `mask` should start from `1` and go up to `2^n - 1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `mask` is a valid bitmask within this range.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The value of `n` must be such that `1 <= n <= 5000`.
   - Since `mask` starts from `1` (the smallest non-empty subset), `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.
   - The list `a` and its length `n` must be valid as described.
   - The initial value of `total_value` is `0`, which is fine for starting the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:

- `n` must be at least `1`.
- `a` must be a valid list of `n` integers where each element is between `1` and `5000`.
- `total_value` remains `0`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a_i <= 5000` for each `i`, the sum of all elements in `a` does not exceed 5000, `MOD` is 998244353, and `total_value` is 0**.
