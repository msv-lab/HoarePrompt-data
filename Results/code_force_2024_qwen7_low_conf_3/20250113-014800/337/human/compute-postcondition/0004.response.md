Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\) for each `i`.
   - The sum of all elements in `a` does not exceed 5000.
   - `MOD` is 998244353.
   - `total_value` is 0.
   - `max_balls` is 0.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1` inclusive.
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must take on values starting from `0` up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to `0` since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by `1` in each iteration.
   - The value of `n` must be at least `1` as given, but we need to ensure it's an integer because the loop range expects an integer.

5. **Resulting States:**
   - `total_value` remains `0`.
   - `max_balls` remains `0`.
   - `i` must be `0`.
   - `n` must be at least `1`.

Therefore, the required states to be adjusted are:

**State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
