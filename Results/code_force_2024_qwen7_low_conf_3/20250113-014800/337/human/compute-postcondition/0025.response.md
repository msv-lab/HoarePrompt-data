Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total_value` is 0.
   - `max_balls` is the maximum of `max(0, a_0)` and `a[1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The condition `if mask & 1 << i` is not considered in the previous iteration since `i` was 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - For each `i` in this range, the loop body is executed.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - We need to check if `i == 2` satisfies the loop condition `i < n`.

5. **Assumptions:**
   - We assume that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (since `i` starts from 1).

6. **State Adjustments:**
   - `total_value` remains unchanged as no operations affecting it are mentioned.
   - `max_balls` remains unchanged as no operations affecting it are mentioned.
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `if mask & 1 << i` will be checked with `i = 2`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is the maximum of `max(0, a_0)` and `a[1]`, `i` is 2**
