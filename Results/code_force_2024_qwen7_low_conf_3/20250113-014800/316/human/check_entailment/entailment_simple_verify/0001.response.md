### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem statement and the examples provided.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cost in two different scenarios:
     - Buying all yogurts at the regular price: `c = a * n`
     - Buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and any remaining single yogurts at the regular price:
       - If `n` is even, the cost would be `d = b * (n // 2)`
       - If `n` is odd, the cost would be `d = b * (n // 2) + a` (since the last yogurt will still be bought at the regular price)

3. **Minimum Cost Determination:**
   - The program correctly determines the minimum cost between the two scenarios using `e = min(c, d)` and prints it.

However, there are a couple of issues with the logic in the program:

1. **Handling Odd Numbers of Yogurts:**
   - The annotated code mentions handling the case when `n` is odd, but the actual implementation does not handle it correctly. Specifically, the expression for `d` should be `d = b * (n // 2) + a` if `n` is odd. Instead, the current implementation always adds `a` regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.

2. **Promotional Cost Calculation:**
   - The promotional cost calculation should be adjusted to handle both even and odd values of `n` properly. The current implementation uses `(n - 2) * a` which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the correct number of promotional pairs and the remaining single yogurt(s).

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            # Calculate the cost for the best promotional deal
            num_pairs = n // 2
            remaining_yogurts = n % 2
            d = b * num_pairs + a * remaining_yogurts
            c = a * n
            e = min(c, d)
        print(e)
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues with the current implementation, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program does not correctly calculate the promotional cost for odd numbers of yogurts and does not handle the scenario where the last yogurt is bought at the regular price.

**Final: False**
