Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying \( n \) yogurts with the given prices. Let's break down the logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. It handles the special case where \( n = 1 \) directly by setting the cost to \( a \).
4. For \( n > 1 \), it calculates two potential costs:
   - The cost without using the promotion (`c = a * n`).
   - The cost using the promotion as much as possible (`d = b + (n - 2) * a` if \( n \geq 2 \)).
5. It then determines the minimum of these two costs and prints it.
6. The logic handles all given examples correctly and covers the necessary edge cases (such as \( n = 1 \)).

Given this detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
