You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        print(e)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. If `n` is 1, it sets `e` to `a`. Otherwise, it calculates `c` as the product of `a` and `n`, and `d` as the sum of `b` and `(n - 2) * a`. Then, it sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`. Finally, it prints `e` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything explicitly; however, it outputs the value of `e` for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 or when `t` is 0 (though the latter would result in no output). There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than or equal to half the regular price for a single yogurt (a). In such cases, it would be more advantageous to always use the promotion price to minimize the total cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 30 15
```
The output should be `30` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt, and he must pay the regular price since the promotion price for two yogurts is not beneficial in this case. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly compute the cost.

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that using the promotion price is beneficial before applying it. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            if b <= a * 2:
                e = b * (n // 2) + (a * (n % 2))
            else:
                e = a * n
        print(e)
```

This corrected version ensures that the promotion price is only used when it is indeed cheaper than buying individual yogurts.
