Reasoning: 

Let's re-evaluate the program's logic step-by-step based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - The program calculates the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`c = a * n`).
   - However, the calculation for the promotional price (`d`) is incorrect. According to the problem description, the promotional price for two yogurts is `b`. If `n` is even, you can buy `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price. If `n` is odd, you can buy `(n - 1) // 2` pairs of yogurts and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

   Specifically, the correct calculation for `d` should be:
   - If `n` is even: `d = b * (n // 2)`
   - If `n` is odd: `d = b * ((n - 1) // 2) + a`

   The current implementation of `d` is incorrect because it always adds `a` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd, which leads to incorrect results for odd `n`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the minimum of `c` and `d` for each test case.

Given these observations, let's correct the implementation and re-run the examples:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            if n % 2 == 0:
                d = b * (n // 2)
            else:
                d = b * ((n - 1) // 2) + a
            e = min(c, d)
        print(e)
```

Re-evaluating the examples with the corrected logic:

- For \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 9 \) (for two yogurts)
  - Minimum cost: \( 9 \)

- For \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 9 + 5 = 14 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 14 \)

- For \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 11 + 5 = 16 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 15 \)

- For \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 20 \)

All these calculations now match the expected outputs, and the logic in the program is consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment was incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the promotional price calculation. The corrected implementation matches the problem description.

Final: **False**
