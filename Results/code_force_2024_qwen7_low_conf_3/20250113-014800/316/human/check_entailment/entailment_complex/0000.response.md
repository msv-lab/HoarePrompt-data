Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts under the given pricing conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. The program initializes \( t \), the number of test cases, by reading an integer input.
2. It then iterates through each test case using a for loop.
3. Inside the loop, it reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) for each test case.
4. It checks if \( n \) is 1. If true, it directly sets \( e \) to \( a \) because the cost of buying one yogurt is just its individual price.
5. If \( n \) is greater than 1, it calculates:
   - \( c \) as the total cost without the promotion (\( n \times a \)).
   - \( d \) as the total cost with the promotion. To derive \( d \), we consider the cost of \( n/2 \) pairs of yogurts (at \( b \) burles per pair) plus any remaining single yogurts (if \( n \) is odd).
6. It then determines \( e \) as the minimum of \( c \) and \( d \).
7. Finally, it prints \( e \) for each test case.

The logic accurately reflects the problem statement and accounts for all possible scenarios, including the edge case where \( n \) is 1 or \( t \) is 0.

Given this analysis, the provided code correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
