Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than or equal to half the regular price for a single yogurt (a). In such cases, it would be more advantageous to always use the promotion price to minimize the total cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 30 15
```
The output should be `30` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt, and he must pay the regular price since the promotion price for two yogurts is not beneficial in this case. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly compute the cost.

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that using the promotion price is beneficial before applying it. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            if b <= a * 2:
                e = b * (n // 2) + (a * (n % 2))
            else:
                e = a * n
        print(e)
```

This corrected version ensures that the promotion price is only used when it is indeed cheaper than buying individual yogurts.
