You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        print(e)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        
        print(e)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input split when `t` was greater than 0, `c` is the product of `a` and `n`, `d` is the sum of `b` and `(n - 2) * a`, and `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`, `e` is printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. If `n` is 1, it sets `e` to `a`. Otherwise, it calculates `c` as the product of `a` and `n`, and `d` as the sum of `b` and `(n - 2) * a`. Then, it sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`. Finally, it prints `e` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything explicitly; however, it outputs the value of `e` for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 or when `t` is 0 (though the latter would result in no output). There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy \( n \) yogurts under the given conditions.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. It then calculates the cost in two different scenarios:
   - Buying all yogurts at the regular price: `c = a * n`
   - Buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and any remaining single yogurts at the regular price: 
     - If \( n \) is even, the cost would be `d = b * (n // 2)`
     - If \( n \) is odd, the cost would be `d = b * (n // 2) + a` (since the last yogurt will still be bought at the regular price)

4. It then prints the minimum of these two costs, `min(c, d)`.

Let's check this logic against the provided examples:

- For \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 9 \) (for two yogurts)
  - Minimum cost: \( 9 \)
  
- For \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 9 + 5 = 14 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 14 \)
  
- For \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 11 + 5 = 16 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 15 \)
  
- For \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 20 \)

All these calculations match the expected outputs, and the logic in the program is consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.
