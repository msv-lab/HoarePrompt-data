### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the logic of the given program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - Maxim needs to buy \( n \) yogurts.
   - The price for one yogurt is \( a \) burles.
   - The price for two yogurts is \( b \) burles.
   - We need to find the minimum cost to buy \( n \) yogurts.

2. **Given Code:**
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
           
           if n == 1:
               e = a
           else:
               c = a * n
               d = b + (n - 2) * a
               e = min(c, d)
           
           print(e)
   ```

3. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The code processes \( t \) test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - If \( n = 1 \), it directly sets \( e \) to \( a \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates two costs:
     - \( c = a * n \): cost if all yogurts are bought individually.
     - \( d = b + (n - 2) * a \): cost if the first two yogurts are bought at the promotional price and the rest at the regular price.
   - It then prints the minimum of \( c \) and \( d \).

4. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The calculation for \( d \) is incorrect. For \( n \) yogurts:
     - If \( n \) is even, the cost would be \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \).
     - If \( n \) is odd, the cost would be \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \times b + a \).

   Let's correct the logic:
   - If \( n \) is even, the cost is \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \).
   - If \( n \) is odd, the cost is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \times b + a \).

   Corrected code:
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
           
           if n == 1:
               e = a
           else:
               if n % 2 == 0:
                   d = (n // 2) * b
               else:
                   d = (n // 2) * b + a
               c = a * n
               e = min(c, d)
           
           print(e)
   ```

5. **Verification:**
   - For \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \):
     - Regular price cost: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
     - Promotional price cost: \( 9 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( 9 \)
   
   - For \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \):
     - Regular price cost: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
     - Promotional price cost: \( 9 + 5 = 14 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( 14 \)
   
   - For \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \):
     - Regular price cost: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
     - Promotional price cost: \( 11 + 5 = 16 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( 15 \)
   
   - For \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \):
     - Regular price cost: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
     - Promotional price cost: \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \)
     - Minimum cost: \( 20 \)

   All these calculations match the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly calculated the promotional price cost, leading to an inaccurate result. The corrected code provides the right logic and matches the expected outputs.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the promotional price cost.
