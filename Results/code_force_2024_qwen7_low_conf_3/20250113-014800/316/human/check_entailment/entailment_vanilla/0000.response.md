Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy \( n \) yogurts under the given conditions.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. It then calculates the cost in two different scenarios:
   - Buying all yogurts at the regular price: `c = a * n`
   - Buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and any remaining single yogurts at the regular price: 
     - If \( n \) is even, the cost would be `d = b * (n // 2)`
     - If \( n \) is odd, the cost would be `d = b * (n // 2) + a` (since the last yogurt will still be bought at the regular price)

4. It then prints the minimum of these two costs, `min(c, d)`.

Let's check this logic against the provided examples:

- For \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 9 \) (for two yogurts)
  - Minimum cost: \( 9 \)
  
- For \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 9 + 5 = 14 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 14 \)
  
- For \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 11 + 5 = 16 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 15 \)
  
- For \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \):
  - Regular price cost: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
  - Promotional price cost: \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \)
  - Minimum cost: \( 20 \)

All these calculations match the expected outputs, and the logic in the program is consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
