The code updates the value of `c` to `a * n`. According to the initial state, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, and `a` is an integer obtained from the input split. Therefore, `c` is updated to the value of `a * n`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split, and `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`**
