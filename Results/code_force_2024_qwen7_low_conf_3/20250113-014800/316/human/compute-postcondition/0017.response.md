Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(10^4\) and is now one less than its previous value; `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split. If `n == 1`, then `e` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`.***
