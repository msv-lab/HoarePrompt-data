`e` is assigned the minimum value between `c` and `d`. Given that `c = a * n` and `d = b + (n - 2) * a`, the values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged, but `e` now holds the minimum of these two values. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) are preserved.

Output State: **`t` is now `t-1`, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split.**
