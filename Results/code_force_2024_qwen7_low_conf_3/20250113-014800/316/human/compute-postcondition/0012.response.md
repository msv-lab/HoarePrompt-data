`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values obtained from the input split and converted to integers. The value of `t` is one less than its previous value, but the specific value of `t` is not provided. The output state is: `t` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(10^4\) and is now one less than its previous value; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input split.

Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(10^4\) and is now one less than its previous value; `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split.**
