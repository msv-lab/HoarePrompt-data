`c` is assigned the value `a * n`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input split, and `n` is not equal to 1; `c` is equal to `a * n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input split, and `n` is not equal to 1; `c` is equal to `a * n`.**
