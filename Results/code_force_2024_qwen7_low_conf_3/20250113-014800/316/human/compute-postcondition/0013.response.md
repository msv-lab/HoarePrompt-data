The code `e = a` assigns the value of `a` to the variable `e`. The value of `a` is obtained from the input split, so the exact value is not specified, but it is known that `a` is an integer obtained from the input split. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `b`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(10^4\) and is now one less than its previous value; `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split; `e` is equal to `a`**
