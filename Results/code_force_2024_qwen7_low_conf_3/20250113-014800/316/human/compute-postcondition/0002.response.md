`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the input is split into three integers, `n`, `a`, and `b` will each take one of these values. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). 

Output State: **`t` is an integer and its value is the input given by the user, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input split**
