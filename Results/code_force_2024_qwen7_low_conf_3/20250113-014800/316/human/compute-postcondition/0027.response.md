Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input split when `t` was greater than 0, `c` is the product of `a` and `n`, `d` is the sum of `b` and `(n - 2) * a`, and `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`, `e` is printed for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration, the following operations are performed:
     - `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from input.
     - If `n == 1`, `e` is set to `a`.
     - Otherwise, `c` is calculated as `a * n` and `d` is calculated as `b + (n - 2) * a`.
     - `e` is then set to the minimum of `c` and `d`.
     - `e` is printed.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `t` iterations, `t` becomes 0 because the loop decrements `t` in each iteration until it reaches 0.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` retain the values they had during the last iteration of the loop.
   - `c` and `d` are calculated based on the values of `a` and `n` from the last iteration.
   - `e` retains the value printed in the last iteration.

Thus, after the loop completes, the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` reflect the values from the last iteration, and `t` is 0.
