`c` is assigned the value `a * n`. The value of `t` is one less than its previous value, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are obtained from the input split. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated, and `c` is set to the product of `a` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is now `t-1`, `c` is `a * n`, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split.**
