`d` is assigned the value of `b + (n - 2) * a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged. The expression for `c` remains `a * n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input split, and `n` is not equal to 1; `c` is equal to `a * n`; `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`**
