The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).

Based on the given output cases, there are two possible return values:

- Case_1: The function returns an integer.
- Case_2: The function returns a tuple containing two integers.

Since the problem statement does not specify which case applies to what condition, we will consider the general form without specifying conditions for now.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) and return either an integer or a tuple of two integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. It returns either an integer or a tuple of two integers.**
