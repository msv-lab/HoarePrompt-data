`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but since the code only takes one input and assigns it to `t`, the value of `t` after the input is taken will be the value entered by the user, which is guaranteed to be within the specified range. The other conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b` are not yet applicable as they haven't been input yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and its value is the input given by the user, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
