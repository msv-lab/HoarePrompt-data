State: **`t` is an integer and its value is the input given by the user, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at all, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer and its value is the input given by the user, but we need to ensure that this integer is valid for the loop to run.
4. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to include the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

This ensures that the loop will run as intended based on the given range.
