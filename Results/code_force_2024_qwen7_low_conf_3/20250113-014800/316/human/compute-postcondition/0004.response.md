`e` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(10^4\), and it must be greater than 0; `n` is 1; `a` is equal to `e`; `b` is an integer obtained from the input split.

Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(10^4\), and it must be greater than 0; `n` is 1; `a` is equal to `e`; `b` is an integer obtained from the input split.**
