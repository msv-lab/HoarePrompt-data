`d` is assigned the value `b + (n - 2) * a`. The value of `n` is obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, and `b` is an integer obtained from the input split. The previous values of `t` and `c` are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is now `t-1`, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split.**
