Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`. If `n` equals 1, then `e` is set to `a * n`. Otherwise, `e` is the minimum of `a * n` and `b + (n - 2) * a`***
