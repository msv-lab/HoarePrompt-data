`e` is reassigned to the value of `a`. Since `a` was previously defined as `a * n`, `e` now holds the value of `a * n`. The value of `e` being reassigned does not depend on the previous value of `e` because it is explicitly set to `a`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is `a * n`**
