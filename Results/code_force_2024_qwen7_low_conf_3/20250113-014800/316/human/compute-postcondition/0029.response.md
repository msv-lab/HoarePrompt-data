Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. If `n` is 1, it sets `e` to `a`. Otherwise, it calculates `c` as the product of `a` and `n`, and `d` as the sum of `b` and `(n - 2) * a`. Then, it sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`. Finally, it prints `e` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything explicitly; however, it outputs the value of `e` for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 or when `t` is 0 (though the latter would result in no output). There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.**
