The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. This affects the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The other variables (`t`, `c`, and `d`) remain unchanged.

Since the initial state of `t` is 1, and the inputs for `n`, `a`, and `b` are obtained from the split input, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `a` is an integer obtained from the input split, `b` is an integer obtained from the input split, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`**
