Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer with a value between 1 and \(10^4\) and must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input split. If `n` is 1, then `a` is equal to `e`, where `e` is `a`. Otherwise, `c` is equal to `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, and `e` is the minimum value between `c` and `d`.***
