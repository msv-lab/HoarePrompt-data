Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program with the given function summary and the problem description. The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect due to issues with the logic used to compute \( f(t) \). However, upon closer inspection and detailed reasoning, we can see that the program is indeed implementing a correct approach to solve the problem.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is correctly computing the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each index in the string `s`. This is crucial for understanding the structure of the string and identifying potential non-palindromic substrings.

2. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The program uses the `p1` and `p2` arrays to determine the first and second positions where a non-palindromic substring starts within the queried range `[l, r]`.
   - The logic for calculating \( f(t) \) for a substring `s_l \ldots s_r` is as follows:
     - If the substring is completely non-palindromic (i.e., `p1[l] >= r`), then \( f(s_l \ldots s_r) = 0 \).
     - If the substring has a palindromic substring ending just before the end (i.e., `p2[l] >= r - 1`), the calculation is simpler.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the total number of substrings and subtracts the number of palindromic substrings of at least the same length.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when the substring is entirely non-palindromic or partially non-palindromic correctly.
   - The function `func_1` is used to precompute the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings, ensuring efficient computation for multiple queries.

Given the function summary and the detailed analysis of the main logic, the program correctly implements the logic to compute \( f(t) \) for the given string and its substrings. The original assessment overlooked the correct implementation details and the proper use of the precomputed `p1` and `p2` arrays.

Final: **True**
