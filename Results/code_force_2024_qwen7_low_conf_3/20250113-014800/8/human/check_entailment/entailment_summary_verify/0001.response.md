### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description and Function Summary Review:
- The problem requires calculating \( f(t) \) for a substring \( s_l \ldots s_r \), which means finding the sum of all values of \( k \) such that the substring is \( k \)-good.
- The function `func_1` computes the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in the string, which helps in determining non-palindromic substrings.

#### Key Components:
1. **Preprocessing with `p1` and `p2`:**
   - `p1[i]` is the rightmost index `j` such that the substring `s[i:j+1]` is not a palindrome.
   - `p2[i]` is similar but considers up to the third character.
   
2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses `p1` and `p2` to determine if there is a non-palindromic substring within the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `p1[l] < r`, there is a non-palindromic substring.
   - If `p2[l] < r-1`, it further checks for a specific pattern.
   - The program then calculates the value of `f(s[l:r])` using these conditions.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Preprocessing (`p1` and `p2`):**
  - These arrays help identify non-palindromic substrings efficiently.
  - However, the logic in the preprocessing phase might miss some non-palindromic substrings, especially when dealing with longer strings.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program correctly uses `p1` and `p2` to check for non-palindromic substrings.
  - The calculation of `f(s[l:r])` seems correct based on the logic described.

However, there is a potential issue in the handling of non-palindromic substrings:
- The program assumes that if `p1[l] < r` or `p2[l] < r-1`, the substring is non-palindromic, but this may not cover all cases.
- Specifically, the logic might miss certain edge cases where non-palindromic substrings exist but are not captured by `p1` or `p2`.

#### Example Validation:
Let's consider the following example to validate the logic:
- Input: `s = "aaab"`, `l = 1`, `r = 4`
- Preprocessing:
  - `p1 = [4, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
  - `p2 = [4, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- Query Handling:
  - For `l = 1`, `r = 4`, `p1[1] = 4 < 4` is true, so the program prints `9`.

Now consider another example:
- Input: `s = "abc"`, `l = 1`, `r = 3`
- Preprocessing:
  - `p1 = [3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - `p2 = [3, 2, 1, 0]`
- Query Handling:
  - For `l = 1`, `r = 3`, `p1[1] = 3 < 3` is true, so the program prints `5`.

Both examples seem correct, but let's consider a more complex case:
- Input: `s = "abca"`, `l = 1`, `r = 4`
- Preprocessing:
  - `p1 = [4, 4, 2, 2, 1]`
  - `p2 = [4, 4, 2, 2, 1]`
- Query Handling:
  - For `l = 1`, `r = 4`, `p1[1] = 4 < 4` is true, so the program prints `10`.

Here, the program might miss the non-palindromic substring `"bca"`.

#### Conclusion:
While the overall logic seems sound, the preprocessing phase might miss certain non-palindromic substrings, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
