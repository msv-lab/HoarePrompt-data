Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the function \( f(t) \) for the given string \( s \). Specifically, the implementation of `func_1` and the main logic for calculating \( f(t) \) for a substring are flawed.

1. **Main Logic Issue**: The main logic for calculating \( f(t) \) for a substring \( s_l \ldots s_r \) is incorrect. The program attempts to use the `p1` and `p2` arrays to find the first and second positions where the substring is not a palindrome, but this approach does not accurately capture all non-palindromic substrings of different lengths.

2. **Function `func_1` Issue**: The function `func_1` calculates the longest palindromic prefix suffix (LPS) for a modified string, which is not directly relevant to the problem of finding non-palindromic substrings. This function is not utilized correctly in the main logic to compute \( f(t) \).

3. **Example Counter-Case**: Consider the string `aaab` and the query for the entire string from index 1 to 4. The expected output is 9, as explained in the problem description. However, the current implementation would fail to correctly compute this value because it does not properly account for all non-palindromic substrings of different lengths within the given substring.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
