### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem statement and example provided.

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then preprocesses the string using two arrays `p1` and `p2`. `p1[i]` stores the rightmost index `j` such that `s[i:j+1]` is not a palindrome, and `p2[i]` does the same but checks up to the third character (`s[i:i+2]`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs an array `res` which stores the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in the string.
   - This preprocessing helps in quickly determining if a substring can be non-palindromic within a given range.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it calculates the length of the substring `s[l:r]`.
   - It uses the precomputed values from `p1` and `p2` to determine if there exists a non-palindromic substring within the range.
   - Depending on the results from `p1` and `p2`, it computes the value of `f(s[l:r])`.

### Analysis:
- **Preprocessing Phase**: The preprocessing ensures that for any substring, we can efficiently check if it is a palindrome.
- **Query Handling**: The logic in the query handling part seems correct in terms of leveraging the precomputed values to determine the presence of non-palindromic substrings and calculating the sum of all possible `k` values.

Given the detailed analysis and the structure of the code, it aligns well with the problem requirements. The program correctly preprocesses the string and uses this information to accurately compute the required values for each query.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above reasoning, the provided program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
