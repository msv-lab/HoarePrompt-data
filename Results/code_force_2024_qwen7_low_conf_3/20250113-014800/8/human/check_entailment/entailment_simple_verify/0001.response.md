### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the program and its annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Initialization and Preprocessing:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading the string `s` and the number of queries `q`.
- The preprocessing phase involves two arrays `p1` and `p2`:
  - `p1[i]` is set to the rightmost index `j` such that `s[i:j+1]` is not a palindrome.
  - `p2[i]` is similarly set to the rightmost index `j` such that `s[i:i+2]` is not a palindrome.

This preprocessing is crucial for efficiently checking non-palindromic substrings.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` constructs an array `res` where `res[z]` represents the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at index `z`.
- This step is correct and essential for the subsequent query handling.

#### Query Handling:
- For each query, the program calculates the length of the substring `s[l:r]`.
- It uses `p1` and `p2` to determine if there exists a non-palindromic substring within the range `[l, r]`:
  - If `p1[l] >= r`, it means there are no non-palindromic substrings in the entire range, so the result is `0`.
  - If `p2[l] >= r - 1`, it means the middle segment is non-palindromic, and the program computes the sum of all `k` values up to `r-l+1 // 2`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of substrings minus the number of palindromic substrings.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Preprocessing Phase**:
   - The preprocessing step is efficient and correct. It ensures that for any substring, we can quickly determine if it is a palindrome or not.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The logic for handling queries is correct:
     - If `p1[l] >= r`, there are no non-palindromic substrings, so the result is `0`.
     - If `p2[l] >= r - 1`, the middle segment is non-palindromic, and the program correctly computes the sum of all `k` values up to `r-l+1 // 2`.
     - Otherwise, the program correctly calculates the total number of substrings minus the number of palindromic substrings.

Given the detailed analysis and the structure of the code, the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem statement and example provided.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
