### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's functionality:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`n`) and the number of queries (`q`), followed by the string itself.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Two arrays `p1` and `p2` are used to store the positions of the first and second mismatches from the current character in the string.
   - These arrays help in quickly determining the nearest mismatched characters to check for non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Palindrome Function** (`func_1`):
   - This function calculates the lengths of the longest palindromes centered at each index in the string.
   - It uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute these lengths.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program extracts the sub-string defined by the given indices `l` and `r`.
   - It then uses the precomputed information in `p1` and `p2` to determine the smallest `k` such that the substring is `k-good`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to get the necessary palindrome information for the sub-string.
   - Based on the calculated values, it determines the sum of all `k` values where the substring is `k-good`.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the preprocessing steps and ensures that the arrays `p1` and `p2` are filled as required.
- The function `func_1` accurately computes the lengths of palindromes centered at each index.
- During query processing, the program checks for non-palindromic substrings and correctly calculates the sum of `k` values where the substring is `k-good`.

Given the provided code and the annotated states, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
