### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem statement and example provided.

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then preprocesses the string using two arrays `p1` and `p2`. `p1[i]` stores the rightmost index `j` such that `s[i:j+1]` is not a palindrome, and `p2[i]` does the same but checks up to the third character (`s[i:i+2]`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs an array `res` which stores the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in the string.
   - This preprocessing helps in quickly determining if a substring can be non-palindromic within a given range.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it calculates the length of the substring `s[l:r]`.
   - It uses the precomputed values from `p1` and `p2` to determine if there exists a non-palindromic substring within the range.
   - Depending on the results from `p1` and `p2`, it computes the value of `f(s[l:r])`.

### Analysis:
- **Preprocessing Phase**: The preprocessing ensures that for any substring, we can efficiently check if it is a palindrome. Specifically, `p1[i]` indicates the rightmost index where the substring starting at `i` is non-palindromic, and `p2[i]` does the same but for a length of 2 or 3 characters.
- **Query Handling**:
  - If `p1[l] >= r`, it means the entire substring `s[l:r]` is a palindrome, hence `f(s[l:r]) = 0`.
  - If `p2[l] >= r - 1`, it means the longest non-palindromic substring starting at `l` and ending before `r` has length at least half the total length of the substring. In this case, the sum of all possible `k` values is calculated as \( \frac{(length - 1) \times length}{2} \).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all possible `k` values by subtracting the number of palindromic substrings from the total number of substrings.

### Detailed Verification:
- The logic in `p1` and `p2` correctly identifies the rightmost non-palindromic substring starting from each position.
- The use of `p1` and `p2` in the query handling part ensures that the program correctly determines if there exists a non-palindromic substring within the range.
- The formula used to calculate the sum of all possible `k` values is correct, as it accounts for all possible substrings and subtracts the number of palindromic substrings.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly preprocesses the string and uses this information to accurately compute the required values for each query. The logic in the query handling part leverages the precomputed values to determine the presence of non-palindromic substrings and calculate the sum of all possible `k` values.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
