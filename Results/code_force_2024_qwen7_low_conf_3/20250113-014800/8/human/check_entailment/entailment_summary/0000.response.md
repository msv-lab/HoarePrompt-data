### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function computes the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each index for a given string `s`.
   - It correctly uses a center expansion technique to find the longest palindrome centered at each index.
   - The logic and implementation of `func_1` are sound and align with the requirements for finding palindromic substrings.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main part of the program preprocesses the string `s` to compute two arrays `p1` and `p2`:
     - `p1[i]` gives the rightmost boundary of the first non-palindromic substring starting at `i`.
     - `p2[i]` gives the rightmost boundary of the first non-palindromic substring starting at `i` that skips over exactly one character.
   - These arrays help efficiently determine if a substring is k-good by checking the boundaries.
   - The main loop processes each query to compute `f(s[l:r+1])` using the precomputed arrays and the `func_1` results.
   - The logic to calculate the result for each query is correct, taking into account the boundaries determined by `p1` and `p2`.

3. **Edge Cases and Input Validation:**
   - The program handles edge cases like empty strings and single-character strings correctly.
   - It also handles the constraints on the size of the input strings and the number of queries appropriately.

Given that the `func_1` function correctly computes the required palindromic substring lengths, and the main program logic correctly uses these results to determine the value of `f(s[l:r+1])` for each query, the overall program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
