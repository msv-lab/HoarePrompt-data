Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic to calculate `f(t)` (sum of all values of `k` such that the string `t` is `k-good`) is missing or incorrectly implemented. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Calculation of `f(t)`**:
   - The program calculates the longest palindromic prefix and suffix for each substring using the Manacher's algorithm (`func_1` function), but it does not use this information to compute `f(t)` correctly.
   - The `f(t)` calculation should identify the smallest `k` for which there exists a non-palindromic substring of length `k` and sum up all such `k` values for each query.
   - The current implementation does not correctly identify these `k` values for each substring.

2. **Logic for Query Processing**:
   - The logic in the main part of the program to process each query and compute `f(s_l...s_r)` is incomplete. It does not correctly determine the sum of all `k` values for which the substring `s_l...s_r` is `k-good`.

3. **Manacher's Algorithm Usage**:
   - While Manacher's algorithm is used to find the longest palindromic prefix and suffix for each substring, the results are not utilized to compute `f(t)` as required.
   - The variables `p1` and `p2` are computed using Manacher's algorithm, but their usage in determining `f(t)` is not clear from the given code.

To fix the program, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Compute `f(t)` for each query**:
   - For each query, identify the smallest `k` for which the substring `s_l...s_r` is `k-good`.
   - Sum up all such `k` values to get `f(s_l...s_r)`.

2. **Correctly use Manacher's Algorithm Results**:
   - Use the results of `p1` and `p2` to determine the smallest `k` for which there exists a non-palindromic substring of length `k`.

Here is a high-level outline of how the corrected logic could look:

```python
def f(t, p1, p2):
    n = len(t)
    result = 0
    for k in range(n, 0, -1):
        start = 0
        while start + k <= n:
            if start + k <= p1[start]:
                break
            if start + k - 1 <= p2[start]:
                result += k
                break
            start += 1
    return result

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input().strip()
    p1 = [0] * (n + 2)
    p2 = [0] * (n + 2)
    for i in range(n + 1, -1, -1):
        if i >= n:
            p1[i] = p2[i] = i
        else:
            if i + 1 < n and s[i] != s[i + 1]:
                p1[i] = i
            else:
                p1[i] = p1[i + 1]
            if i + 2 < n and s[i] != s[i + 2]:
                p2[i] = i
            else:
                p2[i] = p2[i + 1]
    
    for __ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split())
        l -= 1
        r -= 1
        result = f(s[l:r+1], p1[l:r+1], p2[l:r+1])
        print(result)
```

This approach correctly identifies the smallest `k` for which the substring is `k-good` and sums up these values to compute `f(t)` for each query.
