The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It returns either an empty list or a list `res` of \(2 \times n - 1\) elements, where each element represents the length of the palindrome centered at index `z` (where `z` ranges from 0 to \(2 \times n - 2\)).

- If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
- For any other value of `n`, the function constructs a list `res` of length \(2 \times n - 1\). Each element in `res` corresponds to the length of the longest palindrome centered at the corresponding index `z`. The function achieves this by iterating through all possible centers of palindromes within the range `[0, 2 \times n - 2]` and determining the length of the palindrome centered at each such index.

This function effectively computes and returns the lengths of all possible palindromic substrings centered at each position in the given string `s`.
