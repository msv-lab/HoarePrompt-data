The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the only effect is that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j + p + 2 < n`, and `i - p - 2 >= 0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
