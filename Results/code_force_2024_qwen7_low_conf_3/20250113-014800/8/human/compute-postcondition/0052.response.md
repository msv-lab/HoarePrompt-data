Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 1 \geq n` or `i - p - 1 < 0` for the next value of `z`, if `j + p > r` for the next value of `z`, then `l` is `i - p` and `r` is `j + p`, and `res[z + 1]` is equal to `p`; `i` is updated to `(z + 1) // 2`; `j` is updated to `z // 2`; `p` is updated to `0 if i >= r else min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])`**
