`p` is incremented by 1, so the value of `p` changes. However, the initial conditions involving `j + p + 2`, `n`, `i - p - 2`, and the comparison between `s[j + p + 1]` and `s[i - p - 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 2 < n`, `i - p - 2 >= 0`, and `p` is increased by 1.**
