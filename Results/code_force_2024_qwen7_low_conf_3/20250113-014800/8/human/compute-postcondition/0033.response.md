The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the loop or structure being iterated over to terminate. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, the current value of `s` is such that `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or structure.**
