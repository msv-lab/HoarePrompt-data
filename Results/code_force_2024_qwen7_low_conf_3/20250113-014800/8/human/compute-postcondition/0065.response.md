The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `p` was increased by 1 before this line of code was executed, so now `p` is increased by 1 again. The other variables (`total`, `n`, `j + p + 1 < n`, `i - p - 3 >= 0`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 1 < n`, `i - p - 3 >= 0`, and `p` is increased by 1 again.**
