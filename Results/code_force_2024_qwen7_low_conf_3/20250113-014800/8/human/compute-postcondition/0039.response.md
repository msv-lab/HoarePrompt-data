`p` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `p` increases by 1. The conditions involving `n`, `j`, `p`, `i`, and the string `s` remain unchanged unless the specific condition in the example is met. However, since the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is not evaluated here (it only affects the loop or if statement), the output state does not change in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j + p + 2 < n`, and `i - p - 2 >= 0`, and `p` is increased by 1.**
