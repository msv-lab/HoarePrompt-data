Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 1` is less than `n`, `i - p - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and either `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]` (in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken) or there is no else part that changes these conditions.***
