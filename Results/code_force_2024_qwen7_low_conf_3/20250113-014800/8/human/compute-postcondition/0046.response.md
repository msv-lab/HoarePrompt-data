The code assigns the values to `l` and `r`. Specifically, `l` is assigned the value of `i - p` and `r` is assigned the value of `j + p`. The initial conditions state that \( j + p + 1 \geq n \) or \( i - p - 1 < 0 \), and \( p \) is the largest value such that \( s[j + p + 1] == s[i - p - 1] \). The current value of \( j + p \) is greater than \( r \).

After the code execution, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated, and the condition \( j + p + 1 \geq n \) or \( i - p - 1 < 0 \) still holds. Since \( j + p \) was greater than \( r \), and now `r` has been set to `j + p`, the relationship between `j + p` and `r` remains true.

Output State: **`l` is `i - p`, `r` is `j + p`, \( j + p + 1 \geq n \) or \( i - p - 1 < 0 \)**
