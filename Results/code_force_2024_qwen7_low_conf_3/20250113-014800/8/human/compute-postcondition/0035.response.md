`p` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` and the string `s` remain unchanged as the code only affects `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2, and the string `s` has been checked such that if `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]`, the most internal loop or structure is broken out of; `p` is increased by 1.
