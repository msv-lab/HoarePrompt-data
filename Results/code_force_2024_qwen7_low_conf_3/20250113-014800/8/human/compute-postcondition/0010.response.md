Postcondition: ***`total` is not relevant here, `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string with a length greater than 0, `res` is a list of \(2 * n - 1\) elements, all set to 0, `l` is -1, `r` is -1, `z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 0, and the current value of \(s[j + p + 1]\) is not equal to the current value of \(s[i - p - 1]\)***
