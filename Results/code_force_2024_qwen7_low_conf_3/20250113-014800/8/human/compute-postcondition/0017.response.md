The variable `p` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is not relevant, `n` is the length of the string `s` and `s` has a length greater than 0, `res` is a list of \(2 * n - 1\) elements, all set to 0, `l` is -1, `r` is -1, `z` is 0, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 0, `p` is 1 increased by 1.
