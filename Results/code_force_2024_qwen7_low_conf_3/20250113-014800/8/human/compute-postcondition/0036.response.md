Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute one more time.

The loop condition is:
```python
while j + p + 1 < n and i - p - 1 >= 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- The string `s` has been checked such that if `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]`, the most internal loop or structure is broken out of.
- `p` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the while loop must hold true:
1. `j + p + 1 < n`
2. `i - p - 1 >= 0`

We need to ensure these conditions are met for the next iteration. Let's break it down:

1. **Condition 1: `j + p + 1 < n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j + p + 1` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.
   - Since `p` was increased by 1, we need to adjust the state to ensure `j + p + 1 < n`.

2. **Condition 2: `i - p - 1 >= 0`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i - p - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to continue.
   - Since `p` was increased by 1, we need to adjust the state to ensure `i - p - 1 >= 0`.

Given that `p` has been increased by 1, we need to adjust the values of `j` and `i` to satisfy the conditions for the next iteration.

**Adjusted States:**
- `j + (p + 1) + 1 < n` simplifies to `j + p + 2 < n`.
- `i - (p + 1) - 1 >= 0` simplifies to `i - p - 2 >= 0`.

So, we need to ensure that:
- `j + p + 2 < n`
- `i - p - 2 >= 0`

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j + p + 2 < n`, and `i - p - 2 >= 0`**
