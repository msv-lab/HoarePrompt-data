Let's break down the conditions and constraints given in the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial Conditions and Constraints
- The loop continues as long as `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`.
- These conditions must hold true at the start of the next iteration.

### Analyzing the Loop Conditions
1. **Condition 1:** `j + p + 1 < n`
   - For this condition to hold true in the next iteration, `j + p + 1` must be less than `n`.
   - If `j + p + 1 == n` in the current state, then this condition would fail, and the loop would stop.

2. **Condition 2:** `i - p - 1 >= 0`
   - For this condition to hold true in the next iteration, `i - p - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`.
   - If `i - p - 1 == -1` in the current state, then this condition would fail, and the loop would stop.

### Given States
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `j + p + 1 \geq n` or `i - p - 1 < 0` for the next value of `z` if `j + p > r` for the next value of `z`, then `l` is `i - p` and `r` is `j + p`, and `res[z + 1]` is equal to `p`.
- `i` is updated to `(z + 1) // 2`.
- `j` is updated to `z // 2`.
- `p` is updated to `0 if i >= r else min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The current state is such that `j + p + 1 \geq n` or `i - p - 1 < 0` for the next value of `z`.
   - This means either `j + p + 1` is already at least `n`, or `i - p - 1` is already less than `0` when we transition to the next `z`.

2. **Ensuring the Next Iteration:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both conditions `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0` must be true.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the values of `j`, `p`, and `i` to make sure these conditions are met.

### Adjustments Needed
- **Adjusting `j` and `p`:** 
  - We need `j + p + 1 < n` to be true.
  - We need `i - p - 1 >= 0` to be true.
  
- **Adjusting `i`:**
  - The update rule for `i` is `i = (z + 1) // 2`.
  - The update rule for `j` is `j = z // 2`.
  - The update rule for `p` is `p = 0 if i >= r else min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])`.

Given these updates, we need to ensure that the conditions `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0` hold true after these updates.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0` hold true in the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 1` must be less than `n`, and `i - p - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`**.
