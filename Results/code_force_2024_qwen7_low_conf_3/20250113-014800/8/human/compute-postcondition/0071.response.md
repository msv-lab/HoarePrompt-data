Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string with a length greater than 0, `res` is a list of \(2 * n - 1\) elements where each element represents the length of the palindrome centered at index `z` (where `z` ranges from 0 to \(2 * n - 2\)), `l` and `r` are the indices that represent the center of the longest palindrome found so far, `z` is the last iteration index, `i` is the midpoint of the palindrome corresponding to `z`, `j` is the starting index of the palindrome corresponding to `z`, `p` is the length of the palindrome centered at `z`.**
