Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State Recap
- \( n \) remains unchanged.
- \( j + p + 1 \geq n \) or \( i - p - 1 < 0 \) for the next value of \( z \).
- If \( j + p > r \) for the next value of \( z \), then \( l = i - p \) and \( r = j + p \), and \( \text{res}[z + 1] = p \).
- \( i \) is updated to \( (z + 1) // 2 \).
- \( j \) is updated to \( z // 2 \).
- \( p \) is updated to \( 0 \) if \( i \geq r \) else \( \min(r - i, \text{res}[2 \times (l + r) - z]) \).

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as:
\[ j + p + 1 < n \]
and
\[ i - p - 1 \geq 0 \]

### Loop Body
The loop increments \( p \) as long as the characters at indices \( j + p + 1 \) and \( i - p - 1 \) are equal.

### Analysis of Multiple Iterations

#### After 1st Iteration
- \( j + p + 1 < n \)
- \( i - p - 1 \geq 0 \)
- \( p \) is incremented by 1.

#### After 2nd Iteration
- \( j + p + 2 < n \)
- \( i - p - 2 \geq 0 \)
- \( p \) is incremented by 1.

#### After 3rd Iteration
- \( j + p + 1 < n \)
- \( i - p - 3 \geq 0 \)
- \( p \) is incremented by 1.

From this pattern, we can generalize that after \( k \) iterations, the following holds:
- \( j + p + k < n \)
- \( i - p - k \geq 0 \)

Since the loop increments \( p \) each time, it will eventually break when \( j + p + 1 \geq n \) or \( i - p - 1 < 0 \). At that point, the condition \( j + p + 1 \geq n \) will be true, indicating that the loop terminates.

### Final State
When the loop terminates, one of the following conditions must hold:
- \( j + p + 1 = n \)
- \( i - p - 1 < 0 \)

Given the loop updates \( p \) until the characters at \( j + p + 1 \) and \( i - p - 1 \) are no longer equal, the loop will stop when the mismatch is found or the bounds are exceeded.

Thus, after the loop terminates, the following conditions will hold:
- \( j + p + 1 = n \) or \( i - p - 1 < 0 \)
- \( p \) will be the maximum value such that the characters match up to that point.

### Output State
The final state of the variables will be:
- \( n \) remains unchanged.
- \( p \) will be the length of the longest matching prefix between \( s[j + 1:i] \).
- \( j + p + 1 = n \) or \( i - p - 1 < 0 \).

Output State: **\( n \) remains unchanged, \( p \) is the length of the longest matching prefix between \( s[j + 1:i] \), \( j + p + 1 = n \) or \( i - p - 1 < 0 \)**
