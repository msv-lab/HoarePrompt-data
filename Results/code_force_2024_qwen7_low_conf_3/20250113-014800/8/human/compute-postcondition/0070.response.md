The code snippet `res[z] = p` assigns the value of `p` to the element in the list `res` at index `z`. The value of `p` is already known from the initial state. There are no other variables that are affected by this code.

Since the precondition is that `j + p + 1 = n` or `i - p - 1 < 0`, and `j + p` is greater than `r`, the values of `l` and `r` are updated accordingly. However, since the code does not include the updates for `l` and `r`, their values remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `res[z]`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, the length of the longest matching prefix between `s[j + 1:i]` is `p`, and either `j + p + 1 = n` or `i - p - 1 < 0`. `res[z]` is now `p`, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**
