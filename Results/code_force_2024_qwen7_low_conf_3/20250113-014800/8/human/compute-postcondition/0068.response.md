The code assigns `i - p` to `l` and `j + p` to `r`. Given the initial conditions:
- `j + p + 1 = n` or `i - p - 1 < 0`
- The current value of `j + p` is greater than `r`

After executing the code:
- `l` is assigned the value `i - p`
- `r` is assigned the value `j + p`

Since `j + p + 1 = n`, we know `j + p = n - 1`. Also, since `j + p` is currently greater than `r`, this relationship still holds after the assignment.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `l` is now `i - p`
- `r` is now `j + p` which is `n - 1`

The other conditions remain valid. So the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, the length of the longest matching prefix between `s[j + 1:i]` is `p`, `j + p + 1 = n` or `i - p - 1 < 0`, and the current value of `j + p` (now `n - 1`) is greater than `r`; `l` is `i - p`, `r` is `n - 1`**
