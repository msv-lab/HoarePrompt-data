The code `break` does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional block. Since no such loop or conditional block is mentioned in the provided code snippet, the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional structure.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `n` remains unchanged
- `j + p + 1` is less than `n`
- `i - p - 1` is greater than or equal to 0
- The current value of `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]`

These conditions remain valid after the `break` statement executes. 

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 1` is less than `n`, `i - p - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
