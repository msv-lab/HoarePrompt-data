The `break` statement is executed within the loop, which means the loop is exited. No changes are made to the variables inside the loop due to the `break` statement. The states of the variables that were unaffected by the loop remain the same.

Output State: **`total` is not relevant, `n` is the length of the string `s` and `s` has a length greater than 0, `res` is a list of \(2 * n - 1\) elements, all set to 0, `l` is -1, `r` is -1, `z` is 0, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is 0, `p` is 1, and we break out of the loop.**
