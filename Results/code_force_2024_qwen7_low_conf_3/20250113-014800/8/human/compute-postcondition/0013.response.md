The value of `p` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is not relevant here, `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string with a length greater than 0, `res` is a list of \(2 * n - 1\) elements, all set to 0, `l` is -1, `r` is -1, `z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is increased by 1.
