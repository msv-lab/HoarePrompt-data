The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block, but in this case, there is no loop or conditional block that would be exited by the `break` statement. Therefore, the variables remain in their initial states, and the `break` statement itself does not change any values.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 2 < n`, `i - p - 2 >= 0**
