Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string with a length greater than 0, `res` is a list of \(2 * n - 1\) elements, all set to 0, `l` is -1, `r` is -1, `z` is 0, `i` is `2 * p + 1`, `j` is 0, `p` is the maximum value that satisfies the condition `j + p + 1 < n and i - p - 1 >= 0` and if this condition is no longer satisfied, the loop breaks.**
