The `break` statement does not affect the value of `n`, but it indicates that we break out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were in. Since there is no loop or conditional statement affecting `n` in the given code, the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
