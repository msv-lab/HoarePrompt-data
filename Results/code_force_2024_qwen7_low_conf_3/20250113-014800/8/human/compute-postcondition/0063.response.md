The code `break` is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since no loop or match statement is specified, the values of the variables remain unchanged. However, we note that the code breaks out of the implied loop or match statement. The value of `p` is increased by 1 in the precondition, so that change is included.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 1 < n`, `i - p - 3 >= 0`, `p` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or match statement.**
