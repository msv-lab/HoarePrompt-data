The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the initial state, the break statement simply indicates that we would exit from such a structure if it existed. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3 and `i - p - 3 \geq 0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
