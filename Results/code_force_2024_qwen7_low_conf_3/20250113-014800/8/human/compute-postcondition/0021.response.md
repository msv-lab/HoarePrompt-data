`p` is incremented by 1. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same, which is that `s[j + p + 1]` should not be equal to `s[i - p - 1]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `p` is increased by 1, and if `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
