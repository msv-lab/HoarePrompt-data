Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string with a length greater than 0, `res` is a list of \(2 * n - 1\) elements, all set to 0 except for the first element which is now `p`, `l` is \(p + 1\), `r` is \(p\), `z` is \(2 * n - 1\), `i` is `n`, `j` is \((2 * n - 1) // 2\), `p` is 0 if `i` is greater than or equal to `r` else the minimum of \(r - i\) and \((2 * (l + r) - z)\)**.
