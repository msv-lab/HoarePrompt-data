The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.

Based on the output cases:
- Case_1: The function returns an empty list.
- Case_2: The function returns a list `res` of \(2 * n - 1\) elements, where each element represents the length of the palindrome centered at index `z` (where `z` ranges from 0 to \(2 * n - 2\)).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s`, and return either an empty list or a list of \(2 * n - 1\) elements representing the lengths of palindromes centered at various indices.
