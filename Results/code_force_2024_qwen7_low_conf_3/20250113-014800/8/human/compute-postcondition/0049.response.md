To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the conditions and changes that occur within the loop based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `j + p + 1 \geq n` or `i - p - 1 < 0`.
   - If `j + p > r`, then `l` becomes `i - p` and `r` becomes `j + p`.
   - Otherwise, no change occurs.
   - `res[z]` is equal to `p`.

2. **Current Iteration End State:**
   - The condition `j + p + 1 \geq n` or `i - p - 1 < 0` must hold true.
   - If `j + p > r`, then `l` is updated to `i - p` and `r` is updated to `j + p`.
   - `res[z]` is set to `p`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if the condition for the next value of `z` (which is `z + 1`) is satisfied.
   - Since `n` remains unchanged, `n` will still be the same as in the current iteration.
   - The condition for the next iteration would be `j + p + 1 \geq n` or `i - p - 1 < 0` for `z + 1`.
   - If `j + p > r` for the next value of `z`, then `l` will be updated to `i - p` and `r` will be updated to `j + p` for `z + 1`.
   - `res[z + 1]` will be set to `p`.

### Adjusted States:

- `n` remains unchanged.
- `j + p + 1 \geq n` or `i - p - 1 < 0` for the next value of `z`.
- If `j + p > r` for the next value of `z`, then `l` will be `i - p` and `r` will be `j + p`.
- `res[z + 1]` will be equal to `p`.

### Final State:

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 1 \geq n` or `i - p - 1 < 0` for the next value of `z`, if `j + p > r` for the next value of `z`, then `l` is `i - p` and `r` is `j + p`, and `res[z + 1]` is equal to `p`.**
