`p` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the conditions involving `j + p + 1`, `i - p - 1`, and the comparison between `s[j + p + 1]` and `s[i - p - 1]` remain as they were before. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `j + p + 1` is less than `n`, `i - p - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and either `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]` (in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken) or there is no else part that changes these conditions; `p` is incremented by 1.
