According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop iterates over each element in `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must contain at least two elements. If `num` is greater than `max_val`, then `max_val` is updated to `num`. `min_val` remains unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` must contain at least two elements.
- If `num` > `max_val`, then `max_val` is updated to `num`.
- `min_val` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `a` must still contain at least two elements.
- Since we are iterating through each element of `a`, `num` in the next iteration will be the next element in `a`.
- `max_val` might or might not be updated depending on the value of `num` in the next iteration.
- `min_val` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `a`, `max_val` may or may not be updated, `min_val` remains unchanged**.
