Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a` is a list of integers with length `n`.
   - `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`.
   - `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`.
   - `max_expression_value` is calculated as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
   - `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value`.

2. **Loop Context:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - The loop variable `_` is used, indicating that the loop counter itself does not matter, only the number of iterations.

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - Since the loop runs `t` times and there is no modification of `t` within the loop, `t` remains constant.
   - The loop body is omitted, but it doesn't affect the state of the variables outside the loop.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - The state remains unchanged because the loop does not modify any of the listed variables (`a`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, `results`).

5. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop just decrements `t` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be reduced by 1.
   - All other variables (`a`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, `results`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value`, `t` is `t-1`**
