The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case within these `t` cases, it accepts two additional parameters: `n`, an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6.

The function does not have a specified return value in the given output cases, so we can assume it might perform some operations without returning a value directly.
