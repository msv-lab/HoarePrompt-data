The variable `idx` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `idx` is incremented by 1**
