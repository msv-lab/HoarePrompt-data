The code `max_val = num` sets the value of `max_val` to the current value of `num`. This means that `max_val` will now hold whatever value `num` currently holds. The other variables (`a`, `num`, `min_val`) remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `a`, `max_val` is equal to `num`, `min_val` is either the original `min_val` or `num` depending on whether `num` is smaller than `min_val`.**
