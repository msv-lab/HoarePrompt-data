The code initializes an empty list called `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `idx`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6, `idx` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
