`idx` is incremented by the value of `n`. The initial value of `idx` is `4 + original_n`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + original_n]`. After the increment, `idx` will be `4 + original_n + data[3 + original_n]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + original_n]`, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `idx` is `4 + original_n + data[3 + original_n]`, `results` is a list containing `0`, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is 0**
