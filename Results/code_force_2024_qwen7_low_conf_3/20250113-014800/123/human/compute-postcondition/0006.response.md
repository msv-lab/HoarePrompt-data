`n` is assigned the value of `data[idx]`, where `idx` is initially 1. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value of `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6, `idx` is 2, and `results` is an empty list**
