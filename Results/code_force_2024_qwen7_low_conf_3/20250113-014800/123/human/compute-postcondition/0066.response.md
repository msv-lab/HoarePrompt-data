According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will execute if `a` contains at least one element. Let's adjust the states accordingly:

1. **`min_val`**: The initial value of `min_val` is `float('inf')`, but this does not affect whether the loop executes.
2. **`max_val`**: The initial value of `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, but this also does not affect whether the loop executes.
3. **`max_expression_value`**: The value of `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, and this does not affect the loop execution either.
4. **`results`**: Since `results` contains `max_expression_value`, its state is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
5. **`t`**: The state `t` is `t-1`, which might be a typo or irrelevant to the loop itself.
6. **`n`**: The state `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, but this is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
7. **`idx`**: The state `idx` is incremented by `n`, but this is also not directly relevant to the loop execution.

The only relevant state for the loop to execute is `a`, which must contain at least one element.

State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
