The code assigns the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` to the variable `max_expression_value`. Given the initial state, `max_val` and `min_val` are undefined since the list `a` has a length of 0. Therefore, `max_val` and `min_val` are not defined and cannot be used in the calculation. However, the expression `max_val - min_val` would be 0 because there are no elements in the list to determine the maximum or minimum value. As a result, `max_expression_value` is set to `4 * 0`, which is `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced to 0, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is 0.**
