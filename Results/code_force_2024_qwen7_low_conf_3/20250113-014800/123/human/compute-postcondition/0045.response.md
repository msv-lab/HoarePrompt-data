Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers with at least one element. `min_val` is equal to `num` if `num` is less than the minimum value in `a`. Otherwise, `min_val` remains unchanged. `max_val` is equal to `num` if `num` is greater than the maximum value in `a`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.***
