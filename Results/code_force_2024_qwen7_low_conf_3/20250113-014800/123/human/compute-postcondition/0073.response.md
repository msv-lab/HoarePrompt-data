According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The loop can execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` contains at least one element.
- `min_val` is equal to the current minimum value in `a`.
- `max_val` is equal to the maximum value among `a`'s elements.
- If `num` is greater than `max_val` initially, then `max_val` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `num` must be taken from `a`. Therefore, `a` must contain at least one more element. Since `a` contains at least one element now, it must contain at least two elements after this iteration.

Let's adjust the states:

1. `a` must contain at least two elements.
2. `min_val` remains the same as it is determined based on the current state of `a`.
3. `max_val` could either remain the same or be updated if the next `num` is greater than the current `max_val`.

Since the loop can continue as long as `a` has at least one more element, we can state that `a` must have at least two elements. 

State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `min_val` is equal to the current minimum value in `a`, and `max_val` is equal to the maximum value among `a`'s elements.**
