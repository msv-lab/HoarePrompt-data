`idx` is incremented by 1, which means `idx` becomes its previous value plus 1. Given that `idx` was initially `3 + original_n`, after the increment, `idx` will be `4 + original_n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + original_n]`, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced to 0, `idx` is `4 + original_n`, `results` is a list containing `0`, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is 0**
