The code initializes `max_val` to `-inf`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `idx`, `results`, or `min_val`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[3:data[1] + 3]`, `idx` is `3 + data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is positive infinity (`float('inf')`), `max_val` is negative infinity (`float('-inf')`).**
