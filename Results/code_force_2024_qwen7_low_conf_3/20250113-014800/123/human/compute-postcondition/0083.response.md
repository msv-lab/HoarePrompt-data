Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `min_val` is the smallest element in `a`, and `max_val` is the largest element in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.
- If `num` is less than `min_val`, `min_val` is updated to `num`.
- If `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is updated to `num`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `min_val` will hold the smallest element in the list `a`.
- `max_val` will hold the largest element in the list `a`.

Since the loop updates `min_val` and `max_val` based on the elements in `a`, these variables will reflect the minimum and maximum values present in the list after the loop completes.
