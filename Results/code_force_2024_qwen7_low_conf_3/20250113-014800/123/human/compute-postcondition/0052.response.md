The value of `min_val` is updated to be equal to `num`, which is 2. The values of `a`, `max_val`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is 2, and `max_val` is 3, `num` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is 2, and `max_val` is 3, `num` is 2**
