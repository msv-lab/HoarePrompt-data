The code assigns the value 1 to `idx`. The value of `t` is initially set to `data[0]`, `n` remains unchanged (since no operation was performed on it), and `a` remains unchanged (since no operation was performed on it). Therefore, the only change is in the value of `idx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6, `idx` is 1**
