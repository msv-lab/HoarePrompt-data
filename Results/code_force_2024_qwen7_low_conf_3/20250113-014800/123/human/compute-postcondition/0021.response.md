Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 1, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value among the remaining elements in `a`. If `num` is less than `min_val`, then `min_val` remains unchanged.***
