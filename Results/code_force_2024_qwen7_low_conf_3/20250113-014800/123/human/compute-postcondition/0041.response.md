The code assigns the value of `num` to `min_val`. Since the initial state specifies that `num` is less than the minimum value in the list `a`, the value of `min_val` will be set to `num`. The length of `a` and its other elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length at least 1, `num` is less than the minimum value in `a`, `min_val` is equal to `num`**
