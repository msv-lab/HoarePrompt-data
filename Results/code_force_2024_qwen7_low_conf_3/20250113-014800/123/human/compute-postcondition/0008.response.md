Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is 3, and `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts each element in the slice `data[idx:idx + n]` (which corresponds to `data[3:3 + n]` since `idx` is 3) into an integer and creates a new list `a` from these integers. The original values of `t`, `n`, `idx`, and `results` remain unchanged. The updated list `a` consists of integers extracted from the specified slice of `data`.
