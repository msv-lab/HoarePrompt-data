`idx` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `idx` is 2, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6, `idx` is 3, and `results` is an empty list**
