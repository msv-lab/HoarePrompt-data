Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[3:n + 3]`, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value encountered among the elements in `a`, and `max_val` is negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). If `num > max_val`, then the current value of `max_val` is updated to `num`.***
