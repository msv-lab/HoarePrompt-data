The code `min_val = num` attempts to assign the value of `num` to `min_val`. However, there is no variable `num` defined in the given initial state. The closest variable related to the initial state is `min_val`, which is supposed to be the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`. Since the code simply reassigns `min_val` to itself (or potentially to an undefined variable), the actual value of `min_val` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state and the fact that `min_val` is supposed to be the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`, the assignment does not affect the other variables, and `min_val` retains its initial value as the minimum among the remaining elements in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 1, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value among the remaining elements in `a`**
