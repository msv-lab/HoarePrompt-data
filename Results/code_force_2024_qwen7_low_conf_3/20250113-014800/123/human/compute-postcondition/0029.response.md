Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced to 0, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value among all elements in `a`, and `max_val` is the maximum value among all elements in `a`.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, `t` is set to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is set to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[3:n + 3]`.
- `idx` is `3 + n`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `min_val` is initialized to positive infinity (`float('inf')`).
- `max_val` is initialized to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`).

As the loop iterates over each element in `a`, `min_val` is updated to the smallest value encountered, and `max_val` is updated to the largest value encountered. After the loop completes, all elements in `a` have been processed, so `a` becomes an empty list, `min_val` contains the minimum value from `a`, and `max_val` contains the maximum value from `a`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), `a` remains an empty list, and both `min_val` and `max_val` retain their initial values of `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')`, respectively. However, this scenario is not applicable since `n` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 1.
