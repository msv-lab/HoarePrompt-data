`min_val` is reassigned to `float('inf')`. This means that the previous value of `min_val` is no longer valid, and `min_val` is now set to infinity. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`min_val` is float('inf'), `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), `results` contains `max_expression_value`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`**
