The code assigns the value of `4 * (max_val - min_val)` to the variable `max_expression_value`. This calculation uses the maximum value (`max_val`) and the minimum value (`min_val`) from the list `a`, which are unchanged. Therefore, `max_expression_value` is calculated based on the current values of `max_val` and `min_val`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val)**
