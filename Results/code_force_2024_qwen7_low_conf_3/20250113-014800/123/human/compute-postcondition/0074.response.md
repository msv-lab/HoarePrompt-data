The code `min_val = num` assigns the value of `num` to `min_val`. However, the value of `num` is not specified in the initial state. Since `min_val` was initially equal to the current minimum value in `a`, and now it is reassigned to `num`, the new value of `min_val` is `num`. The value of `max_val` remains unchanged because it was initially equal to the maximum value among `a`'s elements and no operation affecting `max_val` has been performed.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `min_val` is equal to `num`, and `max_val` is equal to the maximum value among `a`'s elements.**
