`t` is assigned the value of `data[0]`, which is converted to an integer. The values of `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line.**
