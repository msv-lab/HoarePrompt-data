According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `min_val` is equal to `num` if `num` is less than the minimum value in `a`. Otherwise, `min_val` remains unchanged.
- `max_val` is equal to `num` if `num` is greater than the maximum value in `a`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.

Since the loop is iterating over each element in `a`, at the end of the last iteration, `num` would be the last element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least two elements. This way, the loop can iterate over the next element in the list. The `num` for the next iteration would be the second-to-last element in the current list `a`.

Let's summarize the new states:

- `a` must now have at least two elements (since it must have another element to iterate over).
- `min_val` will be updated based on the next element in `a`.
- `max_val` will be updated based on the next element in `a`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is equal to the next `num` if it is less than the current `min_val`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `max_val` is equal to the next `num` if it is greater than the current `max_val`, otherwise it remains unchanged**
