Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- \( t \) is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- \( n \) is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- \( a \) is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[3:n + 3]`.
- \( idx \) is `3 + n`.
- \( results \) is an empty list.
- \( min_val \) is the minimum value encountered among the elements in \( a \).
- \( max_val \) is updated to \( num \) if \( num > max_val \), otherwise \( max_val \) remains unchanged.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each element in the list \( a \).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States
1. **Check Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list \( a \).
   - After the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state such that the next element in \( a \) is processed.

2. **Update the List \( a \)**:
   - After processing each element, the list \( a \) loses one element.
   - Therefore, the new length of \( a \) will be reduced by one.

3. **Update the Minimum Value (\( min_val \))**:
   - \( min_val \) is updated based on the current element in the loop.
   - After the previous iteration, \( min_val \) should be the minimum value encountered among the remaining elements in \( a \).

4. **Update the Maximum Value (\( max_val \))**:
   - \( max_val \) is updated based on the current element in the loop.
   - After the previous iteration, \( max_val \) will either remain unchanged or be updated to the current maximum value.

### Adjusted States
- \( t \) remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop.
- \( n \) remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop.
- \( idx \) remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop.
- \( results \) remains an empty list because it is not part of the loop.
- \( a \) loses one element, so its length is now \( len(a) - 1 \).
- \( min_val \) is the minimum value among the remaining elements in \( a \).
- \( max_val \) is the maximum value among the remaining elements in \( a \).

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 1, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value among the remaining elements in `a`**.
