`results.append(max_expression_value)` appends the current value of `max_expression_value` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `max_expression_value` is 0. Therefore, after executing this line of code, the value of `max_expression_value` will no longer be relevant, but the value `0` will be appended to `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced to 0, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is a list containing `0`, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is 0.**
