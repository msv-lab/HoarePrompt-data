Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`. For each iteration, the loop updates `min_val` to be the smallest value encountered so far and updates `max_val` to be the largest value encountered so far.
- After the loop completes, `min_val` will be the smallest value in the list `a`, and `max_val` will be the largest value in the list `a`.

Since the loop executes exactly `n` times (one for each element in `a`), the final values of `min_val` and `max_val` will reflect the minimum and maximum values in the list `a`. The length of `a` remains `n`, and the values of other variables like `t`, `n`, `a`, `idx`, `results`, `min_val`, `max_val`, and `max_expression_value` will retain their final states after the loop completes.
