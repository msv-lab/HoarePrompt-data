`max_val` is updated to the value of `num`. According to the initial state, `num` is greater than `max_val`, and `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num < min_val` initially holds true. Since `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to `num`. The value of `a` and the condition for updating `min_val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `min_val` is equal to `num`, `max_val` is equal to `num`, and `num` is greater than `max_val` initially held true.**
