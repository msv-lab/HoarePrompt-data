Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum value of the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each test case, where `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a` and `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`. The function then prints the results for each test case, one per line.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted, meaning that for each test case, the integer `n` is followed by exactly `n` integers. If there are any discrepancies in the input format, the function may fail to process the input correctly.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `n` is less than 4 or greater than 100. While the loop in the code will still execute, it is not specified what should happen if the constraints are violated.
- The function does not handle negative values of `t`. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 500, the function will still process the input, but this might not be the intended behavior.

**Summary of Final State:**
- After the function concludes, the program will have processed `t` test cases.
- For each test case, the function will have calculated the maximum value of `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, where `max_val` and `min_val` are the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` for that test case, respectively.
- The results will be stored in the `results` list and printed to standard output, one result per line.
