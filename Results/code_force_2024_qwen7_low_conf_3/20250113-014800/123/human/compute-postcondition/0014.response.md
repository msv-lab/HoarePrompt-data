`min_val` is assigned the value of `num`. According to the initial state, `num` is a value such that `num < min_val`. Therefore, `min_val` now holds the value of `num`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[3:n + 3]`, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is `num`, `max_val` is negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), `num` is a value such that `num < min_val`**
