According to the given for loop, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a` and the variable `num`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

1. **`t`**: The value of `t` does not affect whether the loop can execute. It is mentioned but not relevant to the loop condition.
2. **`n`**: The value of `n` does not directly impact the loop as well, since the loop depends on the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: The list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
4. **`idx`**: The value of `idx` is not relevant to the loop condition.
5. **`results`**: The value of `results` is not relevant to the loop condition.
6. **`min_val`**: The initial value of `min_val` (set to `float('inf')`) is fine as it will be updated during the loop if `a` contains elements.
7. **`max_val`**: The initial value of `max_val` (set to `float('-inf')`) is fine as it will be updated during the loop if `a` contains elements.
8. **`max_expression_value`**: The initial value of `max_expression_value` (set to `0`) is fine as it will be updated during the loop if `a` contains elements.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `a` must have at least one element.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with length at least 1**
