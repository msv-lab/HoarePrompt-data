`min_val` is assigned the value of `num`. The current minimum value in `a` is greater than or equal to `num`, and `num` is less than the current minimum value in `a`, so `min_val` becomes `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; the current minimum value in `a` is now `num`; `min_val` is `num`**
