The code assigns the value of `num` to `min_val`. This means `min_val` will now hold the value of `num`. The initial state also mentions that `min_val` is equal to the next `num` if it is less than the current `min_val`, and `max_val` is equal to the next `num` if it is greater than the current `max_val`. However, since only `min_val` is updated, the value of `max_val` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is equal to `num`, `max_val` is equal to the next `num` if it is greater than the current `max_val`, otherwise it remains unchanged**
