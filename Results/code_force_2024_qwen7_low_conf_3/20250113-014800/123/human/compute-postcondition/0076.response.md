The code sets `max_val` to the value of `num`. Since `num` is less than `min_val`, `min_val` is already updated. The value of `max_val` is now set to `num`. The precondition that `a` must contain at least two elements remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `min_val` is updated to `num`, `max_val` is now `num`.**
