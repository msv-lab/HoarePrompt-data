The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `data[idx]` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The initial state includes that `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), and `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value`. The variable `t` is also `t-1`, but since `t` was not defined before the code, it is not clear what its initial value was. However, we know it is now `t-1`.

Since `data[idx]` is being used to assign a value to `n`, and without knowing the exact value of `data[idx]`, we cannot specify the exact value of `n`. But we know it is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**
