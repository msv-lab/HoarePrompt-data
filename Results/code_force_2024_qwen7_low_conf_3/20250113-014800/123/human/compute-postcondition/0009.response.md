The code `idx += n` increments the value of `idx` by `n`. Initially, `idx` is set to 3, and `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`. After the increment, `idx` will be `3 + data[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[idx:idx + n]`, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[3:data[1] + 3]`, `idx` is `3 + data[1]`, and `results` is an empty list.**
