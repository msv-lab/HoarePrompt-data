Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the last value of `n` set within the loop and must be between 4 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with length `0`, `idx` is the final value of `idx` which is `3 + n * t`, `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value` for each iteration, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is the maximum value of `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each iteration.**
