The code changes the value of `max_val` to `float('-inf')`. This overrides the previous value of `max_val`, which was the maximum value in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_val` is float('inf'), `max_val` is float('-inf'), `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), `results` contains `max_expression_value`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`**
