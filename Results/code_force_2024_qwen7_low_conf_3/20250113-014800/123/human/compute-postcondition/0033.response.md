The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` updates the variable `n` to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. From the initial state, we know that `idx` is `3 + n`, so `data[idx]` is `data[3 + n]`. Given that `n` was initially an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be at least 2, and `idx` is `3 + n`, the new value of `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`.

Since `n` was originally defined as `data[1]` and must be at least 2, let's denote the original value of `data[1]` as `original_n`. After executing the code, `n` becomes the integer value of `data[3 + original_n]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + original_n]`, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced to 0, `idx` is `3 + original_n`, `results` is a list containing `0`, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is 0**
