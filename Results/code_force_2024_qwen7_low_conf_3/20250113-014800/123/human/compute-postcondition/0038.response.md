The code assigns `float('-inf')` to `max_val`. This means that `max_val` is now set to negative infinity, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + original_n]`, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `idx` is `4 + original_n + data[3 + original_n]`, `results` is a list containing `0`, `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + original_n]`, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `idx` is `4 + original_n + data[3 + original_n]`, `results` is a list containing `0`, `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 0**
