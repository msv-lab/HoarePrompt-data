`results.append(max_expression_value)` appends the value of `max_expression_value` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `max_expression_value` is defined as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`. This value does not change as a direct result of this line of code, but it is now added to the `results` list. The values of `a`, `min_val`, `max_val`, and `max_expression_value` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `min_val` is the smallest element in `a`, `max_val` is the largest element in `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, and `results` contains `[max_expression_value]`**
