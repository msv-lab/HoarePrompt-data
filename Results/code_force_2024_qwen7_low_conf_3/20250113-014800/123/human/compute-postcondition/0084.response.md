The code calculates `max_expression_value` as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `min_val`, or `max_val` directly but assigns a new value to `max_expression_value`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `max_expression_value`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `min_val` is the smallest element in `a`, `max_val` is the largest element in `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`**
