The code appends the value of `max_expression_value` to the list `results`. The value of `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val). The variables `a`, `min_val`, `max_val`, and `max_expression_value` are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `results` with `max_expression_value` appended to it.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value`**
