`max_val` is assigned the value of `num`. According to the initial state, `num` is greater than `max_val`, so after this assignment, `max_val` will be equal to `num`. The other variables (`a`, `min_val`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `min_val` is equal to `num` if `num` is less than the minimum value in `a`, otherwise `min_val` remains unchanged, `max_val` is equal to `num`.**
