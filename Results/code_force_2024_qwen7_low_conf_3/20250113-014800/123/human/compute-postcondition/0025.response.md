The code assigns the value of `num` to `min_val`. Since `num` is defined as the maximum value among the remaining elements in `a` after reducing its length by 1, and `min_val` is being updated to this value, the output state will reflect this change.

The initial state provides that `min_val` is the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`. After executing the line `min_val = num`, `min_val` will be updated to the value of `num`.

The other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 1 (one more element removed), `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is equal to `num`, and `max_val` is equal to the new `num` if `num` is greater than `max_val`; otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.**
