The code sets `min_val` to the value of `num`. Since `num` is the next element in `a`, and `min_val` was previously unchanged, the new value of `min_val` is `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must contain at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `a`, `max_val` may or may not be updated, `min_val` is now `num`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `a`, `max_val` may or may not be updated, `min_val` is `num`**
