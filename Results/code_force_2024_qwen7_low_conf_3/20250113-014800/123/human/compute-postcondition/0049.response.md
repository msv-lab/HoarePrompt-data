The code sets `max_val` to `num`. From the initial state, we know that `num` is one of the elements in the list `a`, and `min_val` and `max_val` are updated based on the values in the list. Since the code does not specify which element `num` is, we will consider the general case where `num` is one of the elements in the list `a`.

After executing `max_val = num`, `max_val` will take the value of `num`. However, without knowing the exact value of `num` relative to the other elements in the list, we can only say that `max_val` is now `num`. The values of `min_val` and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is less than the current `min_val`, `max_val` is now `num`, `num` is one of the elements in the list `a`.**
