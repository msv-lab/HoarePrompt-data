Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 1.
- `idx` is `3 + n`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `min_val` is the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`.
- `max_val` is equal to `num` if `num` is greater than `max_val`; otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.

### For Loop:
```python
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

2. **List `a`**: The list `a` has its length reduced by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. This means that the current list `a` has one less element than it did before.

3. **`idx`**: The value of `idx` is `3 + n`, which does not change within the loop. It remains constant for each iteration.

4. **`results`**: The list `results` remains empty since no elements are added to it during the loop.

5. **`min_val`**: The minimum value among the remaining elements in `a` could change with each iteration as new elements are processed.

6. **`max_val`**: The maximum value among the elements in `a` could change based on the value of `num` during each iteration.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- Since the loop can execute again only if there are elements left in `a`, we need to ensure that `a` still has at least one element.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- `idx` remains `3 + n`.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `min_val` is updated based on the new element being considered.
- `max_val` is updated based on the new element being considered.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 1 (one more element removed).
- `idx` is `3 + n`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `min_val` is the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`.
- `max_val` is equal to the new `num` if `num` is greater than `max_val`; otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 1 (one more element removed), `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value among the remaining elements in `a`, and `max_val` is equal to the new `num` if `num` is greater than `max_val`; otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.**
