According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is less than the current `min_val`, and `max_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is greater than the current `max_val`. `num` is one of the elements in the list `a`.

Since `num` is an element from the list `a`, the next element in the list `a` will be processed in the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `num` is now the next element in the list `a`.

To determine the exact state at the start of the next iteration, we need to know the current values of `min_val` and `max_val`, but since these values do not change based on the position in the list (they only depend on the values in the list), they remain the same.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least two elements.
3. `min_val` and `max_val` are updated based on the current value of `num` in the list.
4. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is updated based on the previous elements, and `max_val` is updated based on the previous elements, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.

To provide a specific example, let's assume the following values after the previous iteration:
- `a = [1, 2, 3]`
- `min_val = 1`
- `max_val = 3`

The next element in the list `a` is `2`. Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is 1, and `max_val` is 3, `num` is 2**.
