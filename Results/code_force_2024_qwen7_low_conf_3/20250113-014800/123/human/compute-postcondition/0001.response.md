`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`. The `input()` function reads a line from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line.
