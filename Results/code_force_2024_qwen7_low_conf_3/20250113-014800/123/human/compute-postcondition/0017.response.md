The code snippet sets `max_val` to `num`. Based on the initial state, `num` is an element of the list `a` starting from index 3 up to `n + 2`. The initial value of `max_val` is negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), and it gets updated if `num` is greater than the current `max_val`.

Since `num` is an element of the list `a`, the new value of `max_val` will be `num` if `num` is greater than `float('-inf')`, which is always true.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in `data[3:n + 3]`, `idx` is `3 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value encountered among the elements in `a`, `max_val` is `num`.**
