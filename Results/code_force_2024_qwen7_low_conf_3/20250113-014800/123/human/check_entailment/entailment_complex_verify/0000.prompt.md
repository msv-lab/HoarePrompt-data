You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 1 2 2 3
    
    8
    
    5 1 3 2 -3 -1 10 3
    
    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        min_val = float('inf')
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for num in a:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val = num

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the last value of `n` set within the loop and must be between 4 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with length `0`, `idx` is the final value of `idx` which is `3 + n * t`, `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value` for each iteration, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is the maximum value of `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted, meaning that for each test case, the integer `n` is followed by exactly `n` integers. If there are any discrepancies in the input format, the function may fail to process the input correctly.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `n` is less than 4 or greater than 100. While the loop in the code will still execute, it is not specified what should happen if the constraints are violated.
- The function does not handle negative values of `t`. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 500, the function will still process the input, but this might not be the intended behavior.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program calculates the maximum value of the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each test case. However, this approach does not consider the distinct indices requirement specified in the problem statement. The formula `4 * (max_val - min_val)` assumes that the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array would yield the maximum value of the expression for any selection of indices `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
1 1 1 2 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
4
```

Explanation: The maximum value of the expression can be achieved by selecting indices such that the differences sum up to 4. For example, choosing `i=1`, `j=4`, `k=2`, and `l=5` gives:
\[ |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2 \]
However, another valid selection could be `i=1`, `j=5`, `k=2`, and `l=4`:
\[ |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \]

But the program's approach would calculate:
\[ 4 * (2 - 1) = 4 \]

This calculation is correct for this specific case, but the program fails to handle more complex scenarios where the optimal choice of indices might lead to a different result. For instance, consider the following case:

Input:
```
1
4
1 2 1 2
```

Expected output:
```
8
```

Explanation: By selecting `i=1`, `j=2`, `k=3`, and `l=4`:
\[ |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \]

But the program would calculate:
\[ 4 * (2 - 1) = 4 \]

This shows that the program does not always find the maximum value of the expression as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
