### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program follows the problem statement and logic, and it handles multiple test cases efficiently. However, there are some potential issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program does not explicitly validate the input values. It assumes that the input is correctly formatted, which means it will process inputs even if they do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `n < 4` or `n > 100`, or `t < 1` or `t > 500`). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input format is incorrect.

2. **Handling Constraints Violations**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array size `n` is less than 4 or greater than 100, or where the number of test cases `t` is outside the specified range. If such cases occur, the program may still execute but produce incorrect results or encounter errors.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly calculates the expression \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\) for each test case. However, it does not account for edge cases where all elements in the array are the same. In such cases, the expression would yield 0, which is the correct result.

4. **Code Readability and Maintainability**:
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, the use of `sys.stdin.read` and `input().split()` can make the code harder to understand for those unfamiliar with these techniques. It would be better to use more descriptive variable names and comments to enhance readability.

### Verification:
- The program correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
- It finds the minimum and maximum values in each array and calculates the expression value as \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\).
- The output format matches the expected format.

However, the program lacks explicit validation of input constraints, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input format is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
While the program logically solves the problem correctly, it is important to ensure that it handles all possible edge cases and input formats correctly. Without proper validation, the program might not behave as expected in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is correct in its logic but should include explicit validation of input constraints to ensure robustness.
