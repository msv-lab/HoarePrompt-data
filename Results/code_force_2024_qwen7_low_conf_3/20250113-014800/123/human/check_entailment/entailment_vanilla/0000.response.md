### Reasoning:
The given Python program aims to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases from standard input and calculating the maximum value of the given expression for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this input to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the details of each test case (the size of the array `n` and the array itself).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program extracts the array size `n` and the array `a`. It then initializes `min_val` to infinity and `max_val` to negative infinity. It iterates through the array to find the minimum and maximum values.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Expression Value**: The expression \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\) is calculated based on the observation that the maximum value of the expression is achieved when the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array is maximized. Since each term in the expression is the absolute difference between consecutive elements, the overall expression can be simplified to \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\).

4. **Storing Results**: The result for each test case is stored in a list called `results`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Verification:
The program correctly follows the problem statement and logic:
- It handles multiple test cases efficiently.
- It correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values in each array.
- It computes the expression value correctly as \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\).
- The output format matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct according to the provided problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
