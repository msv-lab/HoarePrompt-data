Reasoning:  
The provided program `func_1()` attempts to solve the problem by reading input from standard input, splitting it into parts, and processing each test case accordingly. However, there are a few issues that need to be considered:

1. **Input Handling**: The program assumes that the input is correctly formatted and that for each test case, the integer `n` is followed by exactly `n` integers. This is a reasonable assumption based on the problem statement, but the program lacks validation to ensure this condition is met. If the input is malformed, the program will likely fail to process it correctly.

2. **Range Constraints**: Although the program processes the input without checking if `n` is within the specified range (4 ≤ n ≤ 100), it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is outside this range. Given that the loop will still execute regardless of whether `n` is out of bounds, the results may not be meaningful.

3. **Negative Values of `t`**: The program does not handle the case where `t` is less than 1 or greater than 500. If `t` is outside these bounds, the program will still attempt to process the input, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Despite these issues, the core logic of the program is correct in terms of calculating the maximum value of the expression based on the given formula \(4 \times (\text{max value} - \text{min value})\). The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values in the array and uses them to compute the desired expression value.

Given these points, the program is logically correct for the given problem description and execution summary, assuming the input adheres to the specified format and constraints. However, improvements can be made to handle potential edge cases more robustly.

Correctness: **False**

This verdict acknowledges that while the program works as intended under the assumption of correct input, it does not handle all possible edge cases and input formats gracefully.
