Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program calculates the maximum value of the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each test case. However, this approach does not consider the distinct indices requirement specified in the problem statement. The formula `4 * (max_val - min_val)` assumes that the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array would yield the maximum value of the expression for any selection of indices `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
1 1 1 2 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
4
```

Explanation: The maximum value of the expression can be achieved by selecting indices such that the differences sum up to 4. For example, choosing `i=1`, `j=4`, `k=2`, and `l=5` gives:
\[ |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2 \]
However, another valid selection could be `i=1`, `j=5`, `k=2`, and `l=4`:
\[ |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \]

But the program's approach would calculate:
\[ 4 * (2 - 1) = 4 \]

This calculation is correct for this specific case, but the program fails to handle more complex scenarios where the optimal choice of indices might lead to a different result. For instance, consider the following case:

Input:
```
1
4
1 2 1 2
```

Expected output:
```
8
```

Explanation: By selecting `i=1`, `j=2`, `k=3`, and `l=4`:
\[ |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \]

But the program would calculate:
\[ 4 * (2 - 1) = 4 \]

This shows that the program does not always find the maximum value of the expression as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
