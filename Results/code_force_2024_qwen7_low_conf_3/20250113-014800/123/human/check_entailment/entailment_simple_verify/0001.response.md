### Reasoning:

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct. However, let's analyze the program in detail to ensure its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct and efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program correctly extracts the array size `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `min_val` to infinity and `max_val` to negative infinity.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum and maximum values, which is also correct.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Expression Value**:
   - The program calculates the expression \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\). This step is crucial because the maximum value of the expression \(|a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i|\) can indeed be simplified to \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\). This is based on the fact that the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements is maximized when the array consists of the smallest and largest possible values, and there are exactly 4 terms in the expression.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - The results are stored in a list called `results`, which is correct.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line, which matches the expected output format.

However, there is a subtle issue in the original assessment. The program assumes that the array will always have the smallest and largest possible values, but it does not account for the possibility that the array might not be sorted in a way that would maximize the expression. Specifically, the program does not check if the array already contains the smallest and largest values in adjacent positions, which could lead to a suboptimal solution.

To illustrate, consider the following array: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`. The program will find `min_val = 1` and `max_val = 3`, and calculate \(4 \times (3 - 1) = 8\). However, if we consider the arrangement `[3, 1, 2, 1, 3]`, the maximum value of the expression would still be 8, but the program might not detect this correctly.

### Conclusion:
While the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value of the expression under the assumption that the array is unsorted, it does not guarantee that it will find the global maximum for all possible arrays. The program assumes that the array will always have the smallest and largest values in positions that allow the expression to be maximized, but this is not guaranteed without further sorting or permutation checks.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was slightly inaccurate because it did not fully account for the potential edge cases where the array might not have the smallest and largest values in positions that would maximize the expression.
