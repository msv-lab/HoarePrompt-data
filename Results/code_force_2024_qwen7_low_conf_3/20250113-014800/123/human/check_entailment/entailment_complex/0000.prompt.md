You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 1 2 2 3
    
    8
    
    5 1 3 2 -3 -1 10 3
    
    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        min_val = float('inf')
        
        max_val = float('-inf')
        
        for num in a:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val = num
            if num > max_val:
                max_val = num
        
        max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)
        
        results.append(max_expression_value)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the last value of `n` set within the loop and must be between 4 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with length `0`, `idx` is the final value of `idx` which is `3 + n * t`, `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value` for each iteration, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is the maximum value of `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted, meaning that for each test case, the integer `n` is followed by exactly `n` integers. If there are any discrepancies in the input format, the function may fail to process the input correctly.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `n` is less than 4 or greater than 100. While the loop in the code will still execute, it is not specified what should happen if the constraints are violated.
- The function does not handle negative values of `t`. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 500, the function will still process the input, but this might not be the intended behavior.
