Reasoning:
1. The function reads the input correctly and processes each test case as specified.
2. It calculates the minimum and maximum values in the array for each test case, which is necessary to compute the maximum value of the expression \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\).
3. The expression \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\) is derived from the problem statement and correctly maximizes the given expression by taking advantage of the differences between the largest and smallest values in the array.
4. The function handles the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each one correctly, updating the result list appropriately.
5. The function prints the results in the correct format, one per line.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
