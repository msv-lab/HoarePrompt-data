Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem description. Specifically, the formula used to compute the maximum value of the expression is incorrect. According to the problem description, the expression to maximize is:

\[ |a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i| \]

However, the program computes the value as:

\[ 4 \times (max\_val - min\_val) \]

This is incorrect because the program does not consider all possible combinations of \(i, j, k,\) and \(l\). Instead, it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, multiplied by 4. This approach will not necessarily yield the maximum value of the expression described in the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider the second example from the problem description:
- Input: 
  ```
  5
  1 1 2 2 3
  ```

- Expected output: 6
- Explanation: For \(i = 1\), \(j = 3\), \(k = 2\), and \(l = 5\), the value of the expression is:
  \[
  |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6
  \]

However, the program calculates:
\[
4 \times (3 - 1) = 8
\]

This shows that the program's approach does not match the required expression and will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
