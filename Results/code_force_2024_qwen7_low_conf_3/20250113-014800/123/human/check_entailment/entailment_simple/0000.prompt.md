You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 1 2 2 3
    
    8
    
    5 1 3 2 -3 -1 10 3
    
    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        min_val = float('inf')
        
        max_val = float('-inf')
        
        for num in a:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val = num
            if num > max_val:
                max_val = num
        
        max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)
        
        results.append(max_expression_value)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the last value of `n` set within the loop and must be between 4 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with length `0`, `idx` is the final value of `idx` which is `3 + n * t`, `results` is a list containing `max_expression_value` for each iteration, `min_val` is undefined, `max_val` is undefined, `max_expression_value` is the maximum value of `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
