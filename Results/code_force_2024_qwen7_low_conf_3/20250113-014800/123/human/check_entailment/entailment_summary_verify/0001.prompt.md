You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

Input

    5 1 3 2 -3 -1 10 3
    
    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        min_val = float('inf')
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for num in a:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val = num
            if num > max_val:
                max_val = num
        max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)
        results.append(max_expression_value)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))



- Function Summary: 
- The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted, meaning that for each test case, the integer `n` is followed by exactly `n` integers. If there are any discrepancies in the input format, the function may fail to process the input correctly.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `n` is less than 4 or greater than 100. While the loop in the code will still execute, it is not specified what should happen if the constraints are violated.
- The function does not handle negative values of `t`. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 500, the function will still process the input, but this might not be the intended behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The given Python program aims to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases from standard input and calculating the maximum value of the given expression for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this input to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the details of each test case (the size of the array `n` and the array itself).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program extracts the array size `n` and the array `a`. It then initializes `min_val` to infinity and `max_val` to negative infinity. It iterates through the array to find the minimum and maximum values.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Expression Value**: The expression \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\) is calculated based on the observation that the maximum value of the expression is achieved when the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array is maximized. Since each term in the expression is the absolute difference between consecutive elements, the overall expression can be simplified to \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\).

4. **Storing Results**: The result for each test case is stored in a list called `results`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Verification:
The program correctly follows the problem statement and logic:
- It handles multiple test cases efficiently.
- It correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values in each array.
- It computes the expression value correctly as \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\).
- The output format matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct according to the provided problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
