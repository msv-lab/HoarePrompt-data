### Reasoning:
The original assessment is generally accurate, but there are some points that can be refined and verified.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and processes it accordingly. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
   - The function summary mentions that the function assumes the input is correctly formatted. This is a reasonable assumption, but the program should include validation checks to ensure the input format is correct. Without such checks, the program might fail if the input is malformed.

2. **Handling Array Size**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if `n` is within the specified range (4 ≤ n ≤ 100). If `n` is outside this range, the program will still run, but the results might not be meaningful. It would be better to add a check to ensure `n` is within the specified bounds.

3. **Expression Calculation**:
   - The calculation of the maximum expression value \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\) is correct based on the observation that the maximum value of the expression is achieved when the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array is maximized.
   - The program correctly simplifies the expression and computes it as required.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the expected output format, with each result printed on a new line.

### Verification:
- **Input Validation**: The program should include a check to ensure that `n` is within the specified range (4 ≤ n ≤ 100). This ensures that the program behaves correctly even if the input size is out of the expected range.
- **Correctness**: The program correctly calculates the maximum value of the expression for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is mostly correct. However, adding input validation checks would improve the robustness of the program. Given the current logic and the fact that the original assessment already considers the program's correctness, we can maintain the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

This evaluation is based on the program's correctness and the logical steps taken to solve the problem. Adding input validation checks would further enhance the program's reliability, but it does not affect the correctness of the current implementation.
