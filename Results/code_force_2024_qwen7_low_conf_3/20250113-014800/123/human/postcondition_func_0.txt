- The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted, meaning that for each test case, the integer `n` is followed by exactly `n` integers. If there are any discrepancies in the input format, the function may fail to process the input correctly.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `n` is less than 4 or greater than 100. While the loop in the code will still execute, it is not specified what should happen if the constraints are violated.
- The function does not handle negative values of `t`. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 500, the function will still process the input, but this might not be the intended behavior.
