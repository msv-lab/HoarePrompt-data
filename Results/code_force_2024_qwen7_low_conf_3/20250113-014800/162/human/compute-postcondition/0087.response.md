`counter` is assigned the value `x[i] * 2`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1, and `counter` is greater than `x[i]`.

Let's break it down:
- `counter` was originally `x[i]`.
- After executing `counter = x[i] * 2`, `counter` is now `2 * x[i]`.

Since `x[i]` is not equal to 1 and `counter` was originally greater than `x[i]`, `2 * x[i]` will also be greater than `x[i]` (as long as `x[i]` is positive).

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `counter` is now `2 * x[i]`.
- All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`counter` is `2 * x[i]`, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1, and `counter` is greater than `x[i]`**.
