Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(x)):` means that the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < len(x)`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(x) > 1`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `counter` is equal to `x[0]`.
   - `i` is `n_tests - 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be in the range `[1, len(x))`. Given that `i` is initially `n_tests - 2`, we need to ensure that `n_tests - 2 >= 1` and `n_tests - 2 < len(x)`. This can be simplified to `n_tests >= 3` and `n_tests - 2 < len(x)`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n_tests - 2`, after one iteration, `i` will be `n_tests - 1`, and the loop will continue as long as `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, which is already covered by the condition `n_tests - 2 < len(x)`.

4. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `counter` is `x[0]`.
   - `i` should be adjusted to `n_tests - 2`.
   - Ensure `n_tests >= 3` and `n_tests - 2 < len(x)` to allow the loop to execute.
   - `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, so no change is needed here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`counter` is equal to `x[0]`, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`**.
