Postcondition: **`counter` is an integer. If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` remains unchanged. If `counter` is less than or equal to `x[i]`, then `counter` equals `2 * x[i]`. Here, `i` is `n_tests - 1`, `n_tests` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1.**
