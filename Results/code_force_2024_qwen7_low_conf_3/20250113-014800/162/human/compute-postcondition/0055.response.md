Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `counter` is an integer.
   - The loop runs for `i` from 1 to `len(x) - 1`.
   - `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `n_tests - 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `x` is a list of integers, and `len(x)` must be greater than 1.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - For each iteration, if `x[i]` equals 1, then `counter` is incremented by 1.
   - If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, `counter` is set to `2 * x[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n_tests - 2`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `n_tests - 1`.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` (which will be `n_tests - 1`) is less than `len(x)`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` will increment to `n_tests - 1`, we need to ensure that `n_tests - 1` is less than `len(x)` for the loop to continue.
   - `counter` may or may not change based on the value of `x[i]` during this iteration, but its exact new value is not specified as it depends on `x[n_tests - 1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include the updated `i` value and the condition for the loop to continue.

**Final State:**
State: **`counter` is an integer, `i` is `n_tests - 1`, and `n_tests - 1` must be less than `len(x)`**.
