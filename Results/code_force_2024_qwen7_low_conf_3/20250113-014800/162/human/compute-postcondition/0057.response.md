The code snippet `counter = x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])` impacts the `counter` variable. The `ceil` function rounds up the division of `counter` by `x[i]` to the nearest integer. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `x[i]` and `counter`, we cannot determine the exact value of `counter` after the operation. 

Let's denote the initial value of `counter` as `C` and the value of `x[i]` as `Xi`. After the operation, `counter` will be updated to `Xi * ceil(C / Xi)`. Since we don't know the exact values of `C` and `Xi`, we can express the new value of `counter` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`counter` is `Xi * ceil(C / Xi)`**, where `C` is the initial value of `counter` and `Xi` is the value of `x[i]`.
