`counter` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `x`. The value of `x[0]` is taken and assigned to `counter`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `counter` is equal to `x[0]`.
