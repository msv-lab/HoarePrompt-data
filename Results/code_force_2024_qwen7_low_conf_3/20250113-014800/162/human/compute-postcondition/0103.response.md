The code `counter = x[i] * 2` multiplies the value of `x[i]` by 2 and assigns the result to `counter`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `x[2]` determines the new value of `counter`. Since the precondition states that `x[2]` will determine the new value of `counter`, we use `x[2]` directly in the calculation. 

Output State: **`counter` is 2 * `x[2]`, `i` is 2, `n_tests` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`**
