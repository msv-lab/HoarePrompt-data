Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `counter` is updated to either \(x[i] \cdot \lceil \frac{\text{counter}}{x[i]} \rceil\) or \(x[i]\) or \(2 \cdot x[i]\) based on the comparison with `counter` and `x[i]`.***
