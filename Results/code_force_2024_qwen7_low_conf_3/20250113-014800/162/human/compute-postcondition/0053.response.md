Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer. If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` is set to `x[i] * 2`. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged. Here, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1.***
