`counter` is assigned the value of `x[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `counter` becomes `x[2]`. The values of `i` and `n_tests` remain unchanged, and `x[2]` determines the new value of `counter`.

Output State: **`counter` is `x[2]`, `i` is 2, `n_tests` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`**
