Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If `counter` is less than `x[i]`, then `counter` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `counter` is updated to be twice the value of `x[i]`***
