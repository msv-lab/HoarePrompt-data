The code sets `counter` to the value of `x[i]`. Given the precondition, `counter` was previously less than or equal to `x[i]`, and now it is set exactly to the value of `x[i]`. All other conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is equal to `x[i]`, and for all \(i\) in the range \(0 \leq i < len(x)\), `x[i]` is not equal to 1, and for all \(i\) in the range \(0 \leq i < len(x)\), `counter` is less than or equal to `x[i]`. Additionally, for the current iteration where the index is `i`, the value of `counter` is now equal to the value of `x[i]`.**
