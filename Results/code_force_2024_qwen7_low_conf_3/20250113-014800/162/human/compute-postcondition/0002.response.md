The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `n_tests` is greater than 0. The code does not affect `t` or `n_tests`, but it does assign the next input to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer**
