Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer. If `x[i]` equals 1, `counter` is incremented by 1. If `x[i]` is not 1, and `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, `counter` remains unchanged as `Xi * ceil(C / Xi)`. If `counter` is less than or equal to `x[i]`, `counter` is set to either `x[i]` or `2 * x[i]`, whichever is greater, and `x` and `i` retain their original values.***
