`counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. Given that `x[i]` is an element of the list `x` and `i` is an index such that `i < len(x) - 1`, the value of `counter` is updated based on this formula. However, since the exact values of `counter` and `x[i]` are not specified, we express the updated value of `counter` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`, `x` is a list of integers, `i` is an index such that `i < len(x) - 1`**
