`counter` is assigned the value of `x[0]`. The value of `x[0]` is the first element of the list `x`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is equal to `x[0]`, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.

Output State: **`counter` is equal to `x[0]`, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string**
