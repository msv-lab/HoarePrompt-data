Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `counter` is an integer.
- `i` is `n_tests - 1`.
- `n_tests` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`.
- `x[i]` is not equal to 1.

### Loop Condition
The loop iterates over `range(1, len(x))`, which means it starts from `i = 1` up to but not including the length of `x`.

### Previous Iteration Details
- The loop condition for the current iteration is based on the value of `i`.
- Given that `x[i]` is not equal to 1, the possible updates to `counter` are:
  - If `x[i]` is 1, `counter` remains the same.
  - If `x[i]` is not 1 and `counter` is not greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` becomes `2 * x[i]`.
  - Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.

### Current State
- Since `i` is `n_tests - 1`, the loop has not yet reached this point in the current iteration.
- Therefore, `i` is currently set to `1`.

### Next Iteration
For the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1.

- `i` will now be `2`.
- The value of `n_tests` and the condition `x[i]` (where `i` is now `2`) will determine the new value of `counter`.

### Updated States
- `i` will be incremented to `2`.
- `n_tests` remains the same.
- The condition for updating `counter` will depend on the value of `x[2]`.

### Final State
Given the conditions and the next iteration of the loop, we need to update the state accordingly:

- `i` will be `2`.
- `n_tests` remains the same as it did before.
- `x[2]` will determine the new value of `counter`.

### Updated State
- `counter` will be updated based on the value of `x[2]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `n_tests` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`counter` is an integer, `i` is 2, `n_tests` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[2]` will determine the new value of `counter`.**
