Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer. If `x[i]` is 1, then `counter` is equal to its previous value + 1. If `x[i]` is not 1 and `counter` is not greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` equals `2 * x[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged. Here, `i` is `n_tests - 1`, `n_tests` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1.***
