Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements, and `counter` is equal to `x[0]`. The current value of `i` satisfies \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(x)\) and the current value of `x[i]` is 1.***
