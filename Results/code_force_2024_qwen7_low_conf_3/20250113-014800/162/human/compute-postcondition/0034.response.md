Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `counter` is updated to either \(x[i] + 1\), \(x[i] \cdot \lceil \frac{\text{counter}}{x[i]} \rceil\), or \(2 \cdot x[i]\) based on the condition `x[i] == 1` or other specified rules in the else part.***
