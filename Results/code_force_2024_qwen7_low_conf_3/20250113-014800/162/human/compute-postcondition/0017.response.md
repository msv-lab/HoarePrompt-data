Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements, and `counter` is updated as follows: if `counter > x[i]` for the current iteration of `i`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`; otherwise, `counter` is either equal to the current element `x[i]` or `counter` is doubled (`x[0] * 2`). For all \(i\) in the range \(0 \leq i < len(x)\), `x[i]` is not equal to 1, and for all \(i\) in the range \(0 \leq i < len(x)\), `counter` is less than or equal to `x[i]`.***
