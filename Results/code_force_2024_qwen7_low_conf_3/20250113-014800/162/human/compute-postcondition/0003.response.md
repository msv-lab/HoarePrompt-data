The code `x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts each element into an integer, storing them in a list `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the code does not reference `t`. The variable `n_tests` is also not affected. The variable `n` remains unchanged as the code does not reference `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
