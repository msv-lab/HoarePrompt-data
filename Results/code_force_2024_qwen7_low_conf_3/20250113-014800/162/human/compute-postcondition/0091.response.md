Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `counter` is defined based on certain conditions involving `x[i]`.
   - `i` is initially set to `n_tests - 2`.
   - `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`.
   - `x[i]` is not equal to 1.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `len(x) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `counter` is defined as per the given conditions.
   - `i` is `n_tests - 2`.
   - `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`.
   - `x[i]` is not equal to 1.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented.
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments by `1`, the new value of `i` will be `n_tests - 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will become `n_tests - 1`.
   - `n_tests` remains unchanged.
   - `x[i]` (which is now `x[n_tests - 1]`) does not need to satisfy any specific condition because it's the next element in the list.

6. **Counter State**:
   - The state of `counter` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and we don't know what happens inside the loop body.

Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`counter` is equal to `x[0] + 1` if `x[i]` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is equal to `x[n_tests - 2] * ceil(x[0] / x[n_tests - 2])` or `2 * x[i]` if `counter` is not greater than `x[i]`. `i` is `n_tests - 1`, `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1.**
