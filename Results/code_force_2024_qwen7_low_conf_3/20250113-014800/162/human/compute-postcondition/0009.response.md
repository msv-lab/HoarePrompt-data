Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements, and `counter` is equal to `x[0]`, and for all \(i\) in the range \(0 \leq i < len(x)\), `x[i]` is not equal to 1, the current value of `counter` is greater than `x[i]` for the current iteration of `i`**
