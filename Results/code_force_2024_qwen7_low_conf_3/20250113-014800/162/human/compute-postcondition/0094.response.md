The code `counter = x[i]` assigns the value of `x[i]` to `counter`. Based on the initial state, `x[i]` is not equal to 1, and `i` is `n_tests - 1`. Therefore, `counter` is set to `x[i]`.

The states of other variables are not affected. So, the updated states are:
- `counter` is equal to `x[i]`
- `i` is `n_tests - 1`
- `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`

Output State: **`counter` is equal to `x[i]`, `i` is `n_tests - 1`, `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`**
