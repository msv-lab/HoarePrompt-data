Let's break down the given for loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- The for loop is defined as: `for i in range(n_tests):`
- This means the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n_tests - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `counter` is mentioned to be in its original value. However, the loop itself does not involve the variable `counter`. It involves the variable `i` and `n_tests`.

To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n_tests`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented and checked again against `n_tests`.
2. **Variable `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (as per the `range` function), if the loop is to continue, `i` must be less than `n_tests`.
3. **Variable `n_tests`**: The value of `n_tests` remains unchanged within the loop.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must now be `n_tests - 1` and the loop should check if `i < n_tests`.

Since the loop just checks `i < n_tests`, no additional constraints are added to `n_tests` other than ensuring it is greater than `i` (which will naturally be true since `i` was incremented from the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`counter` is its original value, `i` is `n_tests - 1`**
