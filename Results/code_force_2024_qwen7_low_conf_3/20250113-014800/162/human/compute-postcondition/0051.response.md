`counter` is assigned the value `x[i] * 2`. From the initial state, we know `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `x` is a list of integers, `len(x) > 1`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1. Also, `counter` is greater than `x[i]`.

After executing `counter = x[i] * 2`, the new value of `counter` is `x[i] * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`counter` is `x[i] * 2`, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1**
