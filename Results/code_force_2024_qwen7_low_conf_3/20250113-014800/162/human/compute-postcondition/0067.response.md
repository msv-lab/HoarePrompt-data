`counter` is assigned the value `x[i] * 2`. The value of `x[i]` is an integer from the list `x`. The value of `counter` is therefore twice the value of `x[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`counter` is `x[i] * 2`, `x` is a list of integers, `i` is an index such that `i < len(x) - 1`.**
