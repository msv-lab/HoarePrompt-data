`counter` is assigned the value of `x[i] * 2`. The value of `x[i]` is an element from the list `x`, but its specific value is not given. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `counter` is `2 * x[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `counter` is \(2 * x[i]\)**
