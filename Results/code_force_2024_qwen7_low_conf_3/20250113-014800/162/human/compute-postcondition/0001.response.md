To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the loop can run.

### Given Information:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n_tests`: An input integer.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
  - A list of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n_tests):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The `for` loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `n_tests - 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n_tests` is at least 1.

2. **Initialization and Values**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
   - For each test case (corresponding to one iteration of the loop), the values of `n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are defined.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `n_tests`, the only variable that directly controls the loop's execution is `n_tests`. It needs to be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variables `t` and the list of integers for each test case (`n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) do not affect the loop's immediate execution condition but may influence the loop body's behavior.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `n_tests` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` must be greater than 0, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a list of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).**
