The initial state is described as follows: `counter` is equal to `x[0] + 1` if `x[i]` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is equal to `x[n_tests - 2] * ceil(x[0] / x[n_tests - 2])` or `2 * x[i]` if `counter` is not greater than `x[i]`. Here, `i` is `n_tests - 1`, `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1.

The code snippet changes the value of `counter` to `x[i] * 2`.

Given that `x[i]` is not equal to 1 (as per the initial state condition), the new value of `counter` is simply `x[i] * 2`.

The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`counter` is `x[i] * 2`, `i` is `n_tests - 1`, `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1.**
