According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `n_tests`. At the end of the previous iteration, `counter` is in its initial state, meaning it hasn't been modified within the loop body yet. Since `counter` is not directly involved in the loop's condition (which is based on `i` being less than `n_tests`), we need to focus on how `i` changes with each iteration.

At the start of the first iteration, `i` is 0 because the range function starts counting from 0. After each iteration, `i` increments by 1. Therefore, if the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` will be incremented from its previous value.

Since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n_tests`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n_tests - 1` after the previous iteration. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be equal to `n_tests - 1`.

Given that `counter` is in its initial state at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume it hasn't changed, so it remains in its initial state.

State: **`counter` is in its initial state, `i` is `n_tests - 1`**
