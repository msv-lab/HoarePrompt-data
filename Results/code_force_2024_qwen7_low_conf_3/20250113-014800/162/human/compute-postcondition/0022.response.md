`counter` is assigned the value of `x[i]`. The value of `i` is not specified, so it could be any index from 0 to len(x) - 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `counter` is equal to `x[i]` where `i` is an unspecified index between 0 and len(x) - 1.**
