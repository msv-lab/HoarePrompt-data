`counter` is assigned the value of `x[i]`. The value of `i` is such that `i < len(x) - 1`, which means `i` is a valid index for the list `x` but not the last index. The value of `x[i]` is taken and assigned to `counter`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`counter` is `x[i]`, `x` is a list of integers, `i` is an index such that `i < len(x) - 1`**
