Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer. If `x[i]` equals 1, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, `counter` is set to `2 * x[i]`. If neither condition is met, `counter` remains unchanged. Here, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `len(x)` must be greater than 1.***
