Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer. If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` remains unchanged as `Xi * ceil(C / Xi)`. If `counter` is less than or equal to `x[i]`, then `counter` is set to either `x[i]` or `2 * x[i]`, depending on which value is greater, and `x` and `i` retain their original values.***
