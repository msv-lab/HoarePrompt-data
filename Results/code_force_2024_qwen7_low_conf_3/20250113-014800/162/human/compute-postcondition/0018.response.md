Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements, and `counter` is updated as follows: if the current value of `x[i]` is 1, then `counter` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `counter` is greater than the current value of `x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`; otherwise, `counter` is either equal to the current element `x[i]` or `counter` is doubled (`x[0] * 2`).**
