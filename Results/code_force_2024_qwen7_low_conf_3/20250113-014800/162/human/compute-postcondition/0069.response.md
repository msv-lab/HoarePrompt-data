Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `i` is an index such that `i < len(x) - 1`. If `counter > x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. Otherwise, `counter` is set to either `x[i] * 2` or `x[i]` depending on whether `counter < x[i]` or `counter >= x[i]`.***
