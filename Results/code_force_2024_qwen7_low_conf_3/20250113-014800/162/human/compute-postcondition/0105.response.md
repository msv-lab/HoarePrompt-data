Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer, `i` is 2, `n_tests` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`. If `counter` is greater than `x[2]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[2] * ceil(counter / x[2])`. If `counter` is less than or equal to `x[2]`, then `counter` is either set to `x[2]` or `2 * x[2]` depending on the specific condition within the else part.***
