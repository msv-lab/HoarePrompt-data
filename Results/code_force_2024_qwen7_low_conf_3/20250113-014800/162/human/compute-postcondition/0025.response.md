Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. If `counter` is less than or equal to `x[i]`, then `counter` remains unchanged.**
