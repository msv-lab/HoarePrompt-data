`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` will take an input from the user and `int()` will convert it to an integer. The variable `i` is decremented by 1, making it equal to `n_tests - 2`. The value of `counter` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`counter` is its original value, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n` is an input integer**
