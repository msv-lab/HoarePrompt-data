`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it `n_tests - 2`. The initial state of `counter` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`counter` is in its initial state, `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n` is an input integer**
