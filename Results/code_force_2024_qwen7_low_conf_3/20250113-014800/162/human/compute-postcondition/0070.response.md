Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, and `i` is an index such that `i < len(x) - 1`. If `x[i] == 1`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `counter > x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. If `counter <= x[i]`, then `counter` is set to either `x[i] * 2` or `x[i]` depending on whether `counter < x[i]` or `counter >= x[i]`***
