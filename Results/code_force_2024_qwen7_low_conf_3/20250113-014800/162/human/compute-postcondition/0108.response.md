The code `print(counter)` simply prints the current value of `counter`. It does not change the value of `counter` itself. Therefore, the value of `counter` remains unchanged after the print statement is executed.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer, `i` is the last index of `x`, `n_tests` is the length of `x` plus one, and `x[i]` is the last element of `x`. `counter` retains its previous value.**
