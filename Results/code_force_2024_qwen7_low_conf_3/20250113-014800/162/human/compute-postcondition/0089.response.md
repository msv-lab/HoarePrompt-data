Postcondition: ***`counter` is equal to `x[n_tests - 2] * ceil(x[0] / x[n_tests - 2])` or `counter` is equal to `2 * x[i]` if `counter` is not greater than `x[i]`. `i` is `n_tests - 2`, `n_tests` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than the length of `x`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, summarizing the possible states of the `counter` variable after the if-else block executes, while maintaining the preconditions.
