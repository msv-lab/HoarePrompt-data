Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic for determining the year in which all n signs of the apocalypse will occur.
2. The function processes each test case as follows:
   - It initializes `counter` with the first value from the list of periodicities (`x[0]`).
   - It iterates through the remaining values in the list, updating `counter` based on specific conditions.
   - If the current value in the list (`x[i]`) is 1, `counter` is incremented by 1.
   - If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`, ensuring `counter` aligns with the next possible occurrence of the sign.
   - If `counter` is less than `x[i]`, `counter` is directly set to `x[i]`.
   - If `counter` equals `x[i]`, `counter` is set to `x[i] * 2`, although this condition is not necessary based on the problem statement and can be omitted.
3. The logic ensures that `counter` is always updated to the next required occurrence of the sign, taking into account the previous occurrences.
4. The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over them using `n_tests` and processing each one independently.
5. The final value of `counter` for each test case is correctly printed, representing the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
