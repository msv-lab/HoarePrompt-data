Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find the year when all \(n\) signs occur sequentially.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it should read the number of signs \(n\), and the periodicity of each sign \(a_i\).
   - The logic should correctly calculate the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs.

2. **Key Points in the Problem**:
   - If a sign occurs in a certain year, subsequent signs start their cycles from the next year.
   - For each sign, we need to compute the next occurrence year based on the current year and the periodicity of the sign.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It iterates over each test case and processes the signs' periodicities.
   - The variable `counter` is used to keep track of the current year for the last sign seen so far.
   - For each sign, it checks if the sign period is 1 (indicating the sign occurs every year). If so, it increments the counter.
   - For other cases, it uses the `ceil` function to ensure the next occurrence is properly calculated, considering the previous sign's occurrence year.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the sign period is 1 by incrementing the counter.
   - The `ceil` function ensures that the next sign's occurrence year is properly computed based on the previous sign's occurrence.
   - The overall logic seems to follow the sequential occurrence requirement of the signs.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the edge case where the periods are small (like 1), but it does this correctly by simply incrementing the counter.
   - The use of `ceil` ensures that the next occurrence year is correctly rounded up if necessary.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to find the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs, following the sequential occurrence rule.

Correctness: **True**
