Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all n signs will occur. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where multiple signs have the same periodicity correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
2
3
2 2 2
3
1 1 1
```

The expected output should be:

```
2
1
```

However, the program will output:

```
2
1
```

But for the second test case, the correct year should be `1` because all three signs occur in the same year. The issue arises because the program only updates `counter` to the next periodicity value when it encounters a different periodicity. It does not correctly handle the case where multiple signs have the same periodicity.

To fix this, the program should update `counter` to the maximum of the current `counter` and the next periodicity value, ensuring that the waiting period accounts for the latest periodicity encountered so far. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    n_tests = int(input())
    for i in range(n_tests):
        n = int(input())
        x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        counter = x[0]
        for i in range(1, len(x)):
            counter = x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])
        print(counter)


func()
```

This version ensures that the `counter` is updated to the necessary value to account for the latest periodicity encountered, thus correctly calculating the year in which all n signs will occur.
