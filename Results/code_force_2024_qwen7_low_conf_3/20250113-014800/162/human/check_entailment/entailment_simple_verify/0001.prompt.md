You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find the year when all \(n\) signs occur sequentially.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it should read the number of signs \(n\), and the periodicity of each sign \(a_i\).
   - The logic should correctly calculate the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs.

2. **Key Points in the Problem**:
   - If a sign occurs in a certain year, subsequent signs start their cycles from the next year.
   - For each sign, we need to compute the next occurrence year based on the current year and the periodicity of the sign.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It iterates over each test case and processes the signs' periodicities.
   - The variable `counter` is used to keep track of the current year for the last sign seen so far.
   - For each sign, it checks if the sign period is 1 (indicating the sign occurs every year). If so, it increments the counter.
   - For other cases, it uses the `ceil` function to ensure the next occurrence is properly calculated, considering the previous sign's occurrence year.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the sign period is 1 by incrementing the counter.
   - The `ceil` function ensures that the next sign's occurrence year is properly computed based on the previous sign's occurrence.
   - The overall logic seems to follow the sequential occurrence requirement of the signs.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the edge case where the periods are small (like 1), but it does this correctly by simply incrementing the counter.
   - The use of `ceil` ensures that the next occurrence year is correctly rounded up if necessary.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to find the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs, following the sequential occurrence rule.
