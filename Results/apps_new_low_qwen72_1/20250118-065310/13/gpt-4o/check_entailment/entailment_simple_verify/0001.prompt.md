You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible length of a contiguous segment of golden trophies after allowing Vova to perform at most one swap. The approach taken by the program is as follows:

1. **Identify Segments**: It first identifies segments of consecutive 'G' (golden) trophies and stores their start and end indices.
2. **Initial Maximum Length**: It calculates the initial maximum length of these segments.
3. **Single Segment Case**: If there is only one segment of golden trophies, the program returns its length as no swap can increase it.
4. **Adjacent Segments Check**: For multiple segments, it checks if any two segments are separated by exactly one 'S' (silver) trophy. If so, it calculates the combined length of these two segments plus one more (the swapped 'S' trophy) and updates the maximum length accordingly.
5. **Final Adjustment**: It ensures that the final answer does not exceed the total number of trophies, which is a reasonable constraint.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic when considering the case where a single 'S' separates two segments of 'G'. The program adds 1 to the combined length of the two segments, but this assumes that the 'S' can always be swapped out to form a longer segment. This might not always be the case, especially if there are no other 'S' trophies that can be swapped in. Therefore, the program might overestimate the maximum possible length in some edge cases.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where a single 'S' is at the beginning or end of the sequence, which could affect the maximum length calculation.

Given these considerations, the program may not always produce the correct result for all edge cases.
