You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement after a potential swap. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the program attempts to combine segments of golden trophies when they are separated by a single silver trophy. The logic incorrectly assumes that combining such segments always increases the maximum length by 1, which is not always true.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input
8
GGGSGGGG
```
The current program would output `8`, but the correct output should be `7`. Here's why:

- The initial segments are `[0, 2]` and `[4, 7]`.
- The program tries to combine these segments because they are separated by a single silver trophy (`S` at index 3).
- However, the maximum possible beauty after one swap is actually `7`, which can be achieved by swapping the `S` at index 3 with the `G` at index 7, resulting in the sequence `GGGGGGGS`.

Thus, the program does not handle this specific edge case correctly, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
