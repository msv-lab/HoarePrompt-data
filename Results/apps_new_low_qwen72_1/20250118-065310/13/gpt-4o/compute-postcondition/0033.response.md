The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 3, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing tuples representing segments of 'G' characters, `i` is 4, `trophies[0]` is 'S', the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'G', and `start` is 2, and the character at index 4 in `trophies` must be 'G'.**
