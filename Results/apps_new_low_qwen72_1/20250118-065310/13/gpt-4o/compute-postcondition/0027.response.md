Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` is a list containing tuples representing segments of 'G' characters, where each segment is defined as `(start, i - 1)`. `start` is the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` starting from index 0, or `n` if no 'S' is found, and the character at index `start - 1` in `trophies` is 'G'. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', `segments` is [], `i` is 2, and `trophies[0]` is 'S'. The character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S', and `start` is 0.***
