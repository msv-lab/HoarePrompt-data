The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'. `segments` is [], `i` is 2, and `trophies[0]` is 'S'. The character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S', and `start` is 0.**
