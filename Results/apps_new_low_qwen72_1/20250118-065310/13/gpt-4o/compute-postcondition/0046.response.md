Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing exactly one tuple representing a single segment of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, each segment is defined as `(start, end)`, `i` is `n` indicating the loop has processed all characters in `trophies`, `start` is the last value set before the loop ended, which could be any valid index or `n` if the last character is 'G', `max_length` is the length of the single segment of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`.***
