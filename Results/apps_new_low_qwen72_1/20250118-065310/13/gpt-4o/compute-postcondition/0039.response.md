The value of `i` is incremented by 1, from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing tuples representing segments of 'G' characters, `i` is 3, `trophies[0]` is 'S', the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S', and `start` is 0. Additionally, the character at index `i` in `trophies` is not 'G'.**
