The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 1)` if `trophies[i]` is 'G' and `i` is the index of the first occurrence of 'S' in `trophies` starting from index 0, or `i` is `n` if no 'S' is found, and the character at index `i-1` in `trophies` is 'G', or `segments` is [] if `trophies[i]` is 'S', `i` is 1, and `trophies[0]` is 'S', `start` is `i + 1`, and `trophies[1]` must be 'G'**
