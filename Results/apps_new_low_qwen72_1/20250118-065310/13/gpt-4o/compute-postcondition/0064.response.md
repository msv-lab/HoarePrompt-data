The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' (golden trophy) and 'S' (silver trophy). The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If there are no consecutive 'G' characters in the string, the function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: If there is at least one segment of consecutive 'G' characters, the function returns `max_length`, which is the length of the longest segment of consecutive 'G' characters.
- **Case_3**: If there are segments of consecutive 'G' characters separated by a single 'S', the function returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum length of any combined segments of consecutive 'G' characters separated by a single 'S', or the maximum length of any individual segment if no such combination exists.
