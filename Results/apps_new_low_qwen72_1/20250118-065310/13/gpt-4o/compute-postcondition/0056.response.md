The code updates the value of `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value and a new calculated value. The new value is determined by the formula `(curr_end - curr_start + 1) + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `(curr_end - curr_start + 1)` calculates the length of the current segment of consecutive 'G' characters.
- `(prev_end - prev_start + 1)` calculates the length of the previous segment of consecutive 'G' characters.
- Adding 1 accounts for the gap between the two segments.

Thus, the new value being considered for `max_length` is the sum of the lengths of the current and previous segments plus 1 for the gap.

The updated value of `max_length` will be the maximum of its current value and this new calculated value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing more than one tuple, `i` is 1, `start` is the last value set before the loop ended, `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `(curr_end - curr_start + 1) + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `segments`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `segments`.**
