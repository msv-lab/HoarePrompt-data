Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum length of any combined segments of consecutive 'G' characters separated by a single 'S', or the maximum length of any individual segment if no such combination exists, and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).**
