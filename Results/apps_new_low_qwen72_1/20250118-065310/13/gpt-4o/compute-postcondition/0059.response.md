The provided code snippet updates the values of `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` based on the elements in the `segments` list at indices `i-1` and `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'
- `segments` is a list containing more than one tuple
- `i` is 2
- `start` is the last value set before the loop ended
- `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `(curr_end - curr_start + 1) + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged
- `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `segments`
- `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `segments`
- `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `segments`
- `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `segments`

The code snippet:
```
prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
```

Analyzing the entire block of code:
1. `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` updates `prev_start` and `prev_end` to the first and second elements of the tuple at index `i-1` in `segments`.
2. `curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]` updates `curr_start` and `curr_end` to the first and second elements of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.

Since `i` is 2, the indices used are 1 and 2. Let's denote the elements of `segments` as follows:
- `segments[0]` = (`prev_start_0`, `prev_end_0`)
- `segments[1]` = (`prev_start_1`, `prev_end_1`)
- `segments[2]` = (`curr_start_2`, `curr_end_2`)

After executing the code:
- `prev_start` is updated to `prev_start_1`
- `prev_end` is updated to `prev_end_1`
- `curr_start` is updated to `curr_start_2`
- `curr_end` is updated to `curr_end_2`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), trophies is a string of length n containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', segments is a list containing more than one tuple, i is 2, start is the last value set before the loop ended, max_length is the maximum of its previous value and `(curr_end - curr_start + 1) + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`. Otherwise, max_length remains unchanged, prev_start is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in segments, prev_end is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in segments, curr_start is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in segments, curr_end is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in segments**.
