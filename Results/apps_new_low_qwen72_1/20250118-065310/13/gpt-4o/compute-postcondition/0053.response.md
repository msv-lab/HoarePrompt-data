Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'. `segments` is a list containing more than one tuple. `i` is `n`. `start` is the last value set before the loop ended. `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`. `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `n - 1` in `segments`. `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `n - 1` in `segments`. The code will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `segments[n]`. If `curr_start - prev_end` is 2, then `max_length` is updated to `max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
