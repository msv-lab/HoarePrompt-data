Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies`, a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' (golden trophy) and 'S' (silver trophy). The function identifies and processes segments of consecutive 'G' characters in the `trophies` string. It returns the following based on the conditions:

1. **If there are no 'G' characters in the `trophies` string:** The function returns 0.
2. **If there is exactly one segment of consecutive 'G' characters:** The function returns the length of this segment.
3. **If there are multiple segments of consecutive 'G' characters:** The function calculates the maximum length of any segment or the combined length of any two segments separated by a single 'S'. It then returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`.

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- **Empty String:** The function assumes `n` is at least 2, so an empty string is not a valid input. However, if `n` were 0 or `trophies` were an empty string, the function would not execute the main loop and would return 0.
- **Single Character String:** If `n` is 1, the function would not process the string as expected because the loop condition `i < n` would fail immediately. This case should be handled separately.
- **All 'S' Characters:** If the string `trophies` consists entirely of 'S' characters, the function correctly returns 0.
- **Single Segment of 'G':** If the string contains a single segment of 'G' characters, the function correctly returns the length of this segment.
- **Multiple Segments of 'G':** The function correctly handles multiple segments and calculates the maximum length of any combined segments separated by a single 'S'.
- **No Combined Segments:** If no segments are combined, the function returns the maximum length of any individual segment.**

In summary, the function processes a string of trophies and returns the length of the longest possible segment of consecutive 'G' characters, considering potential combinations of segments separated by a single 'S'. It handles edge cases where the string is empty or contains no 'G' characters by returning 0. **
