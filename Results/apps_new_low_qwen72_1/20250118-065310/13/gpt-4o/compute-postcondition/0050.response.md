The provided code snippet assigns the values of the tuples at indices `i - 1` and `i` of the `segments` list to the variables `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `segments` is a list containing more than one tuple.
- `i` is `n`.
- `start` is the last value set before the loop ended (which could be any valid index or `n` if the last character is 'G').
- `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`.
- `len(segments)` must be greater than 1.

The code:
```
prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
```

Since `i` is `n`, the first line of the code snippet retrieves the tuple at index `n - 1` from the `segments` list and assigns the first element of this tuple to `prev_start` and the second element to `prev_end`. The second line retrieves the tuple at index `n` from the `segments` list and assigns the first element of this tuple to `curr_start` and the second element to `curr_end`.

However, since `i` is `n` and `segments` contains more than one tuple, accessing `segments[i]` would result in an `IndexError` because the valid indices for `segments` range from 0 to `len(segments) - 1`. Therefore, the code as provided will raise an error.

To provide a meaningful output state, we need to assume that the code does not raise an error and consider the valid assignment for `segments[i - 1]`:

Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'
- `segments` is a list containing more than one tuple
- `i` is `n`
- `start` is the last value set before the loop ended (which could be any valid index or `n` if the last character is 'G')
- `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`
- `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `n - 1` in `segments`
- `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `n - 1` in `segments`
- **The code will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `segments[n]`**

Thus, the final output state considering the valid assignments is:
Output State: **n is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), trophies is a string of length n containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', segments is a list containing more than one tuple, i is n, start is the last value set before the loop ended, max_length is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G' characters in trophies, prev_start is the first element of the tuple at index n - 1 in segments, prev_end is the second element of the tuple at index n - 1 in segments, and the code will raise an IndexError when trying to access segments[n]**
