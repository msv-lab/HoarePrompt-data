Postcondition: **n is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), trophies is a string of length n containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', segments is a list containing more than one tuple, i is n, start is the last value set before the loop ended, max_length is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G' characters in trophies, prev_start is the first element of the tuple at index n - 1 in segments, prev_end is the second element of the tuple at index n - 1 in segments, and the code will raise an IndexError when trying to access segments[n]. Additionally, the current value of `curr_start - prev_end` is 2.**
