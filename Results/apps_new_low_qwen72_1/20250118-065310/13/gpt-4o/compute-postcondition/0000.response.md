Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' (golden trophy) and 'S' (silver trophy).

Code Block:
```
segments = []
i = 0
```

Analysis:
- The first line initializes an empty list called `segments`.
- The second line initializes an integer variable `i` with the value 0.

No other variables are affected by these lines of code. The values of `n` and `trophies` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, trophies is a string of length n containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', segments is [], i is 0**
