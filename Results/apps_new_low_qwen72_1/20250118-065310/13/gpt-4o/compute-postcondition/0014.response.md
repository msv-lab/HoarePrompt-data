Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 1)`, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of 'S' in `trophies` starting from index 0, or `i` is `n` if no 'S' is found, and the character at index `i-1` in `trophies` is 'G', `start` is 0. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', `segments` is [], `i` is 1, and `trophies[0]` is 'S'.***
