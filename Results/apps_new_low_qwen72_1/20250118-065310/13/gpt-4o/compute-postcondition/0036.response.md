Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing tuples representing segments of 'G' characters, `i` is the smallest index greater than or equal to `start` where `trophies[i]` is 'S' or `i` is `n` if no such index exists, `trophies[0]` is 'S', the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S' if `i < n`, and `start` is 2.**
