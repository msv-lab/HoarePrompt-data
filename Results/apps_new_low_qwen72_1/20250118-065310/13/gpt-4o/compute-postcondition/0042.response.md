Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, indicating there are no segments of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, `i` is `n` indicating the loop has processed all characters in `trophies`, `start` is the last value set before the loop ended, which could be any valid index or `n` if the last character is 'G'. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or if `trophies` is an empty string.***
