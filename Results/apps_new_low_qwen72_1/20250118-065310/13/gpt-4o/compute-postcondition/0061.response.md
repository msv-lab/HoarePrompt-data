Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing more than one tuple, `i` is 2, `start` is the last value set before the loop ended, `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `(curr_end - curr_start + 1) + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, otherwise `max_length` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `segments`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `segments`.***
