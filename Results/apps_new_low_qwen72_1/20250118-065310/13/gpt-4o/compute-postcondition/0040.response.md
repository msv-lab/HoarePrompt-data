Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing tuples representing segments of 'G' characters, `trophies[0]` is 'S'. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` now contains the tuple `(2, i - 1)`, `i` is the smallest index greater than or equal to `start` where `trophies[i]` is 'S' or `i` is `n` if no such index exists, and `start` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 3, the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S', and `start` remains 0.***
