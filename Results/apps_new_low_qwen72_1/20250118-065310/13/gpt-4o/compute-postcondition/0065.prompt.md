You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n containing only the characters 'G' (golden trophy) and 'S' (silver trophy).
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []

i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, each segment is defined as `(start, end)`, where `start` is the starting index of a segment of 'G's and `end` is the ending index of the segment, `i` is `n` indicating the loop has processed all characters in `trophies`, `start` is the last value set before the loop ended, which could be any valid index or `n` if the last character is 'G'. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or if `trophies` is an empty string.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, each segment is defined as `(start, end)`, where `start` is the starting index of a segment of 'G's and `end` is the ending index of the segment, `i` is `n` indicating the loop has processed all characters in `trophies`, `start` is the last value set before the loop ended, which could be any valid index or `n` if the last character is 'G'. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or if `trophies` is an empty string. Additionally, `segments` is not empty.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length

The loop iterates through all elements in `segments` except the first one. For each iteration, it checks if the current segment starts exactly two positions after the end of the previous segment, indicating a single 'S' between them. If so, it updates `max_length` to the combined length of the two segments plus one for the 'S' character. If no such combination exists, `max_length` remains the maximum length of the individual segments.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum length of any combined segments of consecutive 'G' characters separated by a single 'S', or the maximum length of any individual segment if no such combination exists, and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `trophies`. It returns 0 if there are no consecutive 'G' characters. If there is at least one segment of consecutive 'G' characters, it returns the length of the longest segment. If there are segments of consecutive 'G' characters separated by a single 'S', it returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum length of any combined segments of consecutive 'G' characters separated by a single 'S', or the maximum length of any individual segment if no such combination exists.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns `max_length`, which is the length of the single segment of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`.

Case_3: The program returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum length of any combined segments of consecutive 'G' characters separated by a single 'S', or the maximum length of any individual segment if no such combination exists, and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
