Postcondition: ***n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + k, current_count is current_count + 1, current_average is (current_sum + k) / (current_count + 1). If math.ceil(current_average) >= k, the value of current_count - n is printed.***
