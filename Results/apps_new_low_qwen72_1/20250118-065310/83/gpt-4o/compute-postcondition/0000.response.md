The provided code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers named `marks`. It then calculates the sum of the elements in `marks` and stores it in `current_sum`. Additionally, it sets `current_count` to the value of `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100.
- There is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ k.

After executing the code:
- `n` and `k` retain their original values.
- `marks` is now a list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `current_sum` is the sum of the integers in `marks`.
- `current_count` is set to `n`.

Therefore, the final state can be described as:
Output State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is the sum of the integers in marks, current_count is n**
