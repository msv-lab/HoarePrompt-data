The code calculates the average of the integers in the list `marks` by dividing the sum of these integers (`current_sum`) by the number of integers (`current_count`). This average is stored in the variable `current_average`.

- `current_sum` is the sum of the integers in `marks`.
- `current_count` is equal to `n`, which is the number of integers in `marks`.
- The calculation `current_sum / current_count` results in the average of the numbers in `marks`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the same as the input integer `n`, `k` is the same as the input integer `k`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `current_sum` is the sum of the integers in `marks`, `current_count` is `n`, `current_average` is `current_sum / n`.**
