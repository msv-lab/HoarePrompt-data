The provided code snippet updates the values of `current_sum` and `current_count` and then recalculates `current_average`. However, the condition and the print statement are not part of the code snippet provided for execution. Therefore, we will focus on the effects of the two lines given.

Initial State: 
- `n` is the same as the input integer `n`.
- `k` is the same as the input integer `k`.
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `current_sum` is `current_sum + k`.
- `current_count` is `current_count + 1`.
- `current_average` is `(current_sum + k) / (current_count + 1)`.

Code Execution:
```
current_sum += k
current_count += 1
```

The first line increments `current_sum` by `k`. Since `current_sum` was already `current_sum + k`, this line effectively makes `current_sum` equal to `current_sum + 2*k`.

The second line increments `current_count` by 1. Since `current_count` was already `current_count + 1`, this line makes `current_count` equal to `current_count + 2`.

The value of `current_average` is not explicitly recalculated in the provided code snippet, but it would be based on the updated values of `current_sum` and `current_count`.

Final State:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer `n`.
- `k` remains the same as the input integer `k`.
- `marks` remains the same as the list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `current_sum` is now `current_sum + 2*k`.
- `current_count` is now `current_count + 2`.
- `current_average` would be recalculated as `(current_sum + 2*k) / (current_count + 2)` if needed, but this is not part of the provided code snippet.

Output State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + 2*k, current_count is current_count + 2**.
