Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it does not depend on any specific condition in the loop head. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + k, current_count is current_count + 1, current_average is (current_sum + k) / (current_count + 1)**
