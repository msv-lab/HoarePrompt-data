For a `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no modifications are necessary to the state for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is the sum of the integers in marks, current_count is n**
