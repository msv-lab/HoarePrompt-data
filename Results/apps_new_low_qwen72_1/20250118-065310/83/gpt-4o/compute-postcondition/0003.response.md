Postcondition: ***`n` is the same as the input integer `n`, `k` is the same as the input integer `k`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `current_sum` is the sum of the integers in `marks`, `current_count` is `n`, `current_average` is `current_sum / n`. The ceiling of `current_average` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
