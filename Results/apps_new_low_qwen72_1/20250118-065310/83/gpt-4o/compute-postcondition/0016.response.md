The provided code snippet updates the `current_sum` and `current_count` variables and recalculates the `current_average`. Here's the analysis and the final output state:

1. The line `current_sum += k` adds the value of `k` to `current_sum`.
2. The line `current_count += 1` increments `current_count` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the same as the input integer `n`.
- `k` is the same as the input integer `k`.
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `current_sum` is `current_sum + 2*k`.
- `current_count` is `current_count + 2`.
- `current_average` is `(current_sum + 2*k) / (current_count + 2)`.

After executing the code:
- `current_sum` becomes `current_sum + 2*k + k` (or `current_sum + 3*k`).
- `current_count` becomes `current_count + 2 + 1` (or `current_count + 3`).

The new `current_average` is calculated as:
- `current_average = (current_sum + 3*k) / (current_count + 3)`.

The condition `if math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is checked, and if true, `current_count - n` is printed.

Output State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + 3*k, current_count is current_count + 3, current_average is (current_sum + 3*k) / (current_count + 3), if math.ceil(current_average) >= k, then current_count - n is printed**.
