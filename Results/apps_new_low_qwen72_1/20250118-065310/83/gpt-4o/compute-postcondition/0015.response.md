Postcondition: ***`n` is the same as the input integer `n`, `k` is the same as the input integer `k`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `current_sum` is `current_sum + 2*k`, `current_count` is `current_count + 2`, and `current_average` is `(current_sum + 2*k) / (current_count + 2)`. If `math.ceil(current_average) >= k`, then `current_count - n` is printed.***
