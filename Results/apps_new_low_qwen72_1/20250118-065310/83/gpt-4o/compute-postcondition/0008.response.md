The code snippet updates the value of `current_average` to the result of `current_sum / current_count`. The values of `n`, `k`, `marks`, `current_sum`, and `current_count` remain unchanged. The new value of `current_average` is calculated based on the updated values of `current_sum` and `current_count`.

Output State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + k, current_count is current_count + 1, current_average is (current_sum + k) / (current_count + 1)**
