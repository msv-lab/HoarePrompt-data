The provided code snippet updates the `current_sum` and `current_count` variables and does not directly modify `current_average` or `marks`. However, since `current_average` is derived from `current_sum` and `current_count`, it will be indirectly affected.

Initial State:
- `n` is the same as the input integer `n`
- `k` is the same as the input integer `k`
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers read from the input
- `current_sum` is the sum of the integers in `marks`
- `current_count` is `n`
- `current_average` is `current_sum / n`
- If the ceiling of `current_average` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the ceiling of `current_average` is greater than or equal to `k`

Code Execution:
1. `current_sum += k`: This line adds the value of `k` to `current_sum`. The new `current_sum` becomes `current_sum + k`.
2. `current_count += 1`: This line increments `current_count` by 1. The new `current_count` becomes `current_count + 1`.

After these updates, the new `current_average` can be calculated as:
- `new_current_average = (current_sum + k) / (current_count + 1)`

Since the initial `current_average` was `current_sum / n`, the updated `current_average` will reflect the changes in `current_sum` and `current_count`.

Final State:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer `n`
- `k` remains the same as the input integer `k`
- `marks` remains the same as the list of `n` integers read from the input
- `current_sum` is now `current_sum + k`
- `current_count` is now `current_count + 1`
- `current_average` is now `(current_sum + k) / (current_count + 1)`
- The condition about the ceiling of `current_average` being greater than or equal to `k` may change based on the new `current_average`.

Output State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + k, current_count is current_count + 1, current_average is (current_sum + k) / (current_count + 1)**
