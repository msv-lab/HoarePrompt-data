The value of `current_average` is calculated as `current_sum / current_count`. Given that `current_sum` is `current_sum + 2*k` and `current_count` is `current_count + 2`, the new value of `current_average` is `(current_sum + 2*k) / (current_count + 2)`.

The states of `n`, `k`, and `marks` are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + 2*k, current_count is current_count + 2, current_average is (current_sum + 2*k) / (current_count + 2)**.
