Output State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + m*k, current_count is current_count + m, where m is the minimum number of iterations required such that math.ceil((current_sum + m*k) / (current_count + m)) >= k, and current_count - n is printed.**
