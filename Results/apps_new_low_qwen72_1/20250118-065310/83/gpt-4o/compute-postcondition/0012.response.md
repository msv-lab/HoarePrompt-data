Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute the next iteration regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + 2*k, current_count is current_count + 2**
