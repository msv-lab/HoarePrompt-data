Initial State: `n` is the same as the input integer `n`, `k` is the same as the input integer `k`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `current_sum` is `current_sum + 2*k`, `current_count` is `current_count + 2`, `current_average` is `(current_sum + 2*k) / (current_count + 2)`.

Code Block:
```
print(current_count - n)
break
```

Analysis:
- The first line prints the difference between `current_count` and `n`.
- The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement used to exit loops. However, since this code snippet is not inside a loop, it will cause a syntax error if executed in isolation.

Given that the `break` statement outside of a loop will raise a syntax error, the code will not execute properly. Therefore, we can only consider the effect of the first line.

Output State:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer `n`.
- `k` remains the same as the input integer `k`.
- `marks` remains a list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `current_sum` remains `current_sum + 2*k`.
- `current_count` remains `current_count + 2`.
- `current_average` remains `(current_sum + 2*k) / (current_count + 2)`.
- The value `current_count - n` is printed, but this does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **n is the same as the input integer n, k is the same as the input integer k, marks is a list of n integers read from the input, current_sum is current_sum + 2*k, current_count is current_count + 2, current_average is (current_sum + 2*k) / (current_count + 2), current_count - n is printed**.
