Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach to determining the minimum number of additional marks required to achieve the desired final mark `k`. Specifically, the loop continues to add the highest mark `k` until the average (when rounded up) is at least `k`. However, this approach may result in adding more marks than necessary.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3 5
4 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

The program's output for this input is indeed correct, but let's consider another example:

Input:
```
4 10
9 9 9 9
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

However, the program outputs:
```
5
```

This is incorrect because the average of `[9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]` is `9.4444`, which rounds up to `10`. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this case and adds one fewer mark than necessary.

To correct this, the program should ensure that the average (when rounded up) is exactly `k` and not just greater than or equal to `k`. This can be achieved by checking the exact condition for rounding up.
