Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum number of additional marks (each of the highest possible value `k`) that need to be added to the list of marks to ensure that the average, when rounded according to the rules specified, equals the highest mark `k`.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input, reading the number of marks `n` and the highest mark `k`, followed by the list of marks.
2. **Initial Sum and Count**: It initializes the sum of the current marks (`current_sum`) and the count of marks (`current_count`).
3. **Loop to Add Marks**: The program enters a loop where it calculates the current average of the marks. It uses `math.ceil` to round the average up to the nearest integer, as per the problem's rounding rule.
4. **Check Condition**: If the rounded average is at least `k`, it prints the difference between the current count and the original count of marks, which represents the number of additional marks added.
5. **Update Sum and Count**: If the condition is not met, it adds another mark of value `k` to the sum and increments the count, then repeats the loop.

The logic is sound and aligns with the problem statement. The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the average is rounded correctly, and the loop continues until the desired average is achieved.

Correctness: **True**
