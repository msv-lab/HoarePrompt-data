Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of additional marks needed to ensure Noora’s final mark is `k`. Here’s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values correctly. It takes `n` and `k` as the number of marks and the highest possible mark, respectively, and then reads a list of `n` marks.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the initial marks and initializes the count of marks (`current_count`) to `n`.

3. **Average Calculation and Condition Check**: The program enters a loop where it continuously checks if the ceiling of the current average is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, it prints the number of additional marks added (`current_count - n`) and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Adding Marks**: If the current average is not sufficient, the program adds the highest possible mark `k` to the sum and increments the count of marks. This process continues until the condition is met.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well. If the initial list of marks already meets the condition (i.e., the ceiling of the average is at least `k`), it correctly prints 0. If the initial marks are significantly lower, it will keep adding `k` until the condition is satisfied.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
