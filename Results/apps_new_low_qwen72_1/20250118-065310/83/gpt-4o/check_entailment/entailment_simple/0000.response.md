Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum number of additional marks (all of value `k`) needed to be added to Noora’s existing marks so that the average mark, when rounded, equals `k`. Here’s how the program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the number of existing marks and `k` is the highest possible mark. It then reads `n` marks into a list called `marks`.

2. **Initial Calculations**: It calculates the sum of the existing marks (`current_sum`) and sets the initial count of marks (`current_count`) to `n`.

3. **Loop to Find Minimum Additional Marks**: The program enters a loop where it continuously adds the highest mark (`k`) to the `current_sum` and increments the `current_count` until the ceiling of the average of the marks (`current_average`) is at least `k`.

4. **Output**: Once the condition is met, the program prints the difference between the current count of marks and the original count (`current_count - n`), which represents the number of additional marks added.

### Key Points to Verify:
- **Initial State**: The initial state of the program is correctly set up with `n`, `k`, and the list of marks.
- **Sum and Count**: The sum of the marks and the count of marks are correctly initialized.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until the ceiling of the average is at least `k`, ensuring that the final mark is `k`.
- **Increment Logic**: Each iteration of the loop adds the highest mark (`k`) to the sum and increments the count, simulating the addition of a new mark.
- **Output**: The output is the difference between the final count and the initial count, which correctly gives the number of additional marks added.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the initial marks already average to `k`.
- **Rounding**: The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the average is rounded correctly according to the problem statement.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
