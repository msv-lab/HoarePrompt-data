Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of marks. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `current_sum` with the sum of the marks and `current_count` with `n`, which are the initial sum and count of marks, respectively.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until the ceiling of the average mark is at least `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current average, when rounded up, is at least `k`. If it is, it prints the number of additional marks added (`current_count - n`) and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not met, it adds the maximum mark `k` to `current_sum` and increments `current_count`.

4. **Termination**: The loop ensures that the minimum number of additional marks are added to achieve the desired average, and the program correctly prints the number of additional marks needed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the initial list already meets the condition, the loop will terminate immediately without adding any additional marks.
   - If the initial marks are significantly less than `k`, the loop will continue until the condition is met, ensuring the correct number of additional marks are added.

Given that the program follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
