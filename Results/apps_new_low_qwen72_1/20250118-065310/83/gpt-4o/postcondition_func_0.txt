The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the minimum number of additional values, each equal to `k`, that need to be added to the list to ensure that the ceiling of the average of the list is at least `k`. The function prints the number of additional values needed. After the function concludes, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `marks` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `current_sum` is the sum of the original list plus `m * k` (where `m` is the number of additional values added), and `current_count` is `n + m`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where the initial list already meets the condition, in which case no additional values are needed, and scenarios where the list contains values that are significantly less than `k`, requiring a large number of additional values to meet the condition.
