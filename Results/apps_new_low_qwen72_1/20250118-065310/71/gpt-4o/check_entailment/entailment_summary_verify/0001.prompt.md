You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads two values, `n` and `k`, from user input, where `n` is a string representation of an integer and `k` is an integer. The function then processes the digits of `n` from right to left, counting the number of zeros (`count_zeros`) and the number of non-zero digits encountered (`to_remove`) until it finds `k` zeros. If `k` zeros are found, the function prints the number of non-zero digits encountered (`to_remove`). If fewer than `k` zeros are found, the function prints the length of `n` minus one. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` contains no zeros and when `k` is greater than the number of zeros in `n`. In both cases, the function will print the length of `n` minus one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum number of digits to remove from `n` to make it divisible by \(10^k\). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is split into `n` and `k`, where `n` is converted to a string and `k` is converted to an integer.
2. **Initialization**: Two counters are initialized: `count_zeros` to count the number of trailing zeros found, and `to_remove` to count the number of digits to remove.
3. **Reverse Traversal**: The program traverses the digits of `n` in reverse order (from right to left).
   - If the current digit is '0', it increments `count_zeros`.
   - If the current digit is not '0', it increments `to_remove`.
4. **Breaking Condition**: The loop breaks when `count_zeros` equals `k`, meaning we have found enough trailing zeros to make the number divisible by \(10^k\).
5. **Output**:
   - If `count_zeros` equals `k`, it prints `to_remove`, which is the number of digits to remove.
   - If `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, it means it's impossible to find `k` trailing zeros by removing fewer digits, so it prints `len(n) - 1` (removing all but one digit to get the number 0).

The logic is sound and correctly handles the problem requirements. It ensures that the result is divisible by \(10^k\) by counting trailing zeros and removing non-zero digits as needed. The edge case where the number becomes 0 is also handled correctly.
