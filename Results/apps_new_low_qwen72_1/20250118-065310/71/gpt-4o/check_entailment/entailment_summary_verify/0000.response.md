### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads two values, `n` and `k`, from the user input. `n` is converted to a string, and `k` is converted to an integer.
   - This is consistent with the problem description and function summary.

2. **Processing the Digits:**
   - The function processes the digits of `n` from right to left (reversed order).
   - It maintains two counters: `count_zeros` to count the number of zeros and `to_remove` to count the number of non-zero digits encountered.
   - For each digit, if it is '0', `count_zeros` is incremented. If it is not '0', `to_remove` is incremented.
   - The loop continues until `count_zeros` reaches `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - If `count_zeros` equals `k`, the function prints `to_remove`, which is the number of non-zero digits removed.
   - If `count_zeros` does not reach `k`, the function prints `len(n) - 1`, which means removing all but one digit to make the result 0.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **No Zeros in `n`:** If `n` contains no zeros, the function will print `len(n) - 1`, which is correct because removing all but one digit will result in 0.
   - **Fewer than `k` Zeros:** If `n` contains fewer than `k` zeros, the function will also print `len(n) - 1`, which is correct because the only way to make the number divisible by \(10^k\) is to reduce it to 0.
   - **Already Divisible by \(10^k\):** If `n` is already divisible by \(10^k\), the function will correctly identify this and print 0 (since no digits need to be removed).

5. **Validation with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `30020 3`
     - Output: `1`
     - Explanation: Removing the digit '2' results in `3000`, which is divisible by \(10^3\).
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `100 9`
     - Output: `2`
     - Explanation: Removing '1' and '0' results in `0`, which is divisible by \(10^9\).
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `10203049 2`
     - Output: `3`
     - Explanation: Removing '1', '2', and '3' results in `0049`, which simplifies to `49`, and further removing '4' and '9' results in `0`, which is divisible by \(10^2\).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of digits to remove from `n` to make it divisible by \(10^k\). It handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem description accurately.
