Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, and k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())

k = int(k)

count_zeros = 0

to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of '0's encountered up to the point where `count_zeros` equals `k` or the end of the string, `to_remove` is the number of non-'0' digits encountered before `count_zeros` reaches `k`. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop iterates through all characters in `n`. The loop does not execute if `n` is empty or if `k` is 0 and there are no '0's in `n`.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of '0's encountered up to the point where `count_zeros` equals `k` or the end of the string, and `to_remove` is the number of non-'0' digits encountered before `count_zeros` reaches `k`. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` is printed, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, the length of `n` minus 1 is printed, and the loop continues to iterate through all characters in `n`. The loop does not execute if `n` is empty or if `k` is 0 and there are no '0's in `n`.
