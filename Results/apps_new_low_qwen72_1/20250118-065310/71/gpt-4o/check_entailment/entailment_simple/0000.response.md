### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The input is correctly parsed into `n` and `k` as strings, and `k` is converted to an integer. This is necessary because we need to iterate over the digits of `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count_zeros` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of zeros encountered.
   - `to_remove` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of non-zero digits that need to be removed.

3. **Loop Through Digits:**
   - The loop iterates over the digits of `n` in reverse order. This is a good approach because we need to find the last `k` zeros in the number.
   - If a digit is '0', `count_zeros` is incremented.
   - If a digit is not '0', `to_remove` is incremented.
   - The loop breaks when `count_zeros` equals `k`, which means we have found the required number of trailing zeros.

4. **Output:**
   - If `count_zeros` equals `k`, the program prints `to_remove`, which is the number of non-zero digits removed.
   - If `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, the program prints `len(n) - 1`. This is because if we cannot find `k` zeros, the only way to make the number divisible by \(10^k\) is to reduce it to 0, which requires removing all but one digit.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `n` is 0 correctly. If `n` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0, the program will still output the correct number of digits to remove (which is 0).
   - The program also handles cases where `n` has fewer than `k` zeros by printing `len(n) - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of digits to remove to make the number divisible by \(10^k\). It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.
