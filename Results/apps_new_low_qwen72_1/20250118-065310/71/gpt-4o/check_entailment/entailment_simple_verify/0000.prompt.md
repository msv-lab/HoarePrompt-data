You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, and k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())

k = int(k)

count_zeros = 0

to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of '0's encountered up to the point where `count_zeros` equals `k` or the end of the string, `to_remove` is the number of non-'0' digits encountered before `count_zeros` reaches `k`. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop iterates through all characters in `n`. The loop does not execute if `n` is empty or if `k` is 0 and there are no '0's in `n`.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of '0's encountered up to the point where `count_zeros` equals `k` or the end of the string, and `to_remove` is the number of non-'0' digits encountered before `count_zeros` reaches `k`. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` is printed, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, the length of `n` minus 1 is printed, and the loop continues to iterate through all characters in `n`. The loop does not execute if `n` is empty or if `k` is 0 and there are no '0's in `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles the problem as described. It iterates over the digits of the number `n` from the end to the beginning, counting the number of zeros (`count_zeros`) and the number of non-zero digits to remove (`to_remove`). When it finds `k` zeros, it stops and outputs the number of digits removed. If it cannot find `k` zeros, it outputs `len(n) - 1`, which means removing all but one digit, effectively making the result 0, which is divisible by any power of 10. This approach ensures that the minimum number of digits are removed to achieve a number divisible by \(10^k\), and it handles edge cases such as when the number is already divisible by \(10^k\) or when the number needs to be reduced to 0. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
