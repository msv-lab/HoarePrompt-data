Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, and the current character `digit` is either '0' or not '0'. If `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1. Additionally, the current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`.***
