The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `count_zeros` can be either 0 or 1 depending on whether the next `digit` is '0' or not. After the increment, `count_zeros` will be 1 if the next `digit` was '0', or 2 if the next `digit` was not '0'. However, since `count_zeros` starts at 0 when the next `digit` is not '0', it cannot reach 2 through this increment alone. Therefore, the only valid scenario is that `count_zeros` was 0 and is now 1. The value of `to_remove` remains unchanged. The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement are not met because `count_zeros` does not equal `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, `digit` will be the next character in the reversed string `n`, `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0 if the next `digit` is '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 1.**
