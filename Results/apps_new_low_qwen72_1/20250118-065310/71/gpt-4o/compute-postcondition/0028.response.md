The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer with a constraint 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000, and `k` is an integer with a constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output logic is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000 and `k` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 9. The function returns a value based on these parameters.**
