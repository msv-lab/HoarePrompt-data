Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of '0's encountered up to the point where `count_zeros` equals `k` or the end of the string, and `to_remove` is the number of non-'0' digits encountered before `count_zeros` reaches `k`. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` is printed, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, the length of `n` minus 1 is printed, and the loop continues to iterate through all characters in `n`. The loop does not execute if `n` is empty or if `k` is 0 and there are no '0's in `n`.***
