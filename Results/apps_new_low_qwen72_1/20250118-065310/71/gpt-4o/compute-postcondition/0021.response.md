Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, `digit` is the next character in the reversed string `n`. If `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `to_remove` is increased by 1. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
