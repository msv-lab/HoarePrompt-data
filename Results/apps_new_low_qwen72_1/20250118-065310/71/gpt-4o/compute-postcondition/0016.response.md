To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop header:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character.
- `k` is an integer.
- `digit` is the next character in the reversed string `n`.
- If `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0.
- If `digit` is not '0', `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1.
- If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, the values of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` remain unchanged.

### Loop Header:
```python
for digit in reversed(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in the reversed string `n`.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `digit` will be updated to the next character in the reversed string `n`.
   - The length of `n` remains the same, but the next character in the reversed sequence will be different.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `k` is a fixed integer and does not change.
   - `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character.
- `k` is an integer.
- `digit` is the next character in the reversed string `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, `digit` is the next character in the reversed string `n`.**
