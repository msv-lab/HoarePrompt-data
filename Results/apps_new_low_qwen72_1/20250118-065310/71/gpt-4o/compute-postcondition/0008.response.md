The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing. Since no variables are explicitly modified by this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. However, the control flow of the program is affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `digit` is either '0' or not '0', `count_zeros` is `k`, `to_remove` is 0 if `digit` is '0' or 1 if `digit` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
