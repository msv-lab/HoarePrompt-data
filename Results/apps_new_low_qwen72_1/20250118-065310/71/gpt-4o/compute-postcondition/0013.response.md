Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, and `digit` is the next character in the reversed string `n`. If `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. If `digit` is not '0', `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` remain unchanged.***
