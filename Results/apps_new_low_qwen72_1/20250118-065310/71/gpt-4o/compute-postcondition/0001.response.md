To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions that allow the loop to start iterating. In this case, the loop is iterating over the characters in the string `n` in reverse order.

Here's the breakdown:

- The loop uses `reversed(n)`, which means it will iterate over each character in the string `n` starting from the last character.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the string `n` must not be empty. If `n` is an empty string, `reversed(n)` will yield no elements, and the loop body will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a string
- `k` is an integer
- `count_zeros` is 0
- `to_remove` is 0

For the loop to execute the first time, the string `n` must contain at least one character. The other variables (`k`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove`) do not affect the loop's ability to start, but their values remain as specified.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0**
