The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `digit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, `digit` is the next character in the reversed string `n`, `count_zeros` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, `digit` is the next character in the reversed string `n`, `count_zeros` is increased by 1**
