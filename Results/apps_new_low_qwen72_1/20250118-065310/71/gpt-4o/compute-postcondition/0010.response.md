The only object in the loop head is the variable `digit`, and the iterable is the reversed string `n`. The state of `digit` changes with each iteration as it takes the next character from the reversed string `n`. Since `n` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still contain at least one more character to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, and the current character `digit` is either '0' or not '0'. For the next iteration, `digit` will be the next character in the reversed string `n`.

Since `digit` is determined by the next character in `n`, and `n` is a string that must still have characters left for the loop to continue, the state adjustment is primarily about the remaining characters in `n`.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, and the current character `digit` will be the next character in the reversed string `n`. If the next `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. If the next `digit` is not '0', `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` remain unchanged.**
