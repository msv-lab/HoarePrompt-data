Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of '0's encountered up to the point where `count_zeros` equals `k` or the end of the string, `to_remove` is the number of non-'0' digits encountered before `count_zeros` reaches `k`. `count_zeros` equals `k`. The loop breaks if `count_zeros` equals `k`; otherwise, the loop iterates through all characters in `n`. The loop does not execute if `n` is empty or if `k` is 0 and there are no '0's in `n`.***
