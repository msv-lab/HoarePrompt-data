The provided code snippet reads two values from the input, converts them to strings, splits them, and then converts the second value back to an integer. It also initializes two variables, `count_zeros` and `to_remove`, to 0.

- The first line reads the input and splits it into two parts, converting both parts to strings. The first part is assigned to `n`, and the second part is assigned to `k`.
- The second line converts `k` to an integer.
- The third and fourth lines initialize `count_zeros` and `to_remove` to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 9

After executing the code:
- `n` is now a string representation of the first part of the input.
- `k` is now an integer representation of the second part of the input.
- `count_zeros` is initialized to 0.
- `to_remove` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **n is a string, k is an integer, count_zeros is 0, to_remove is 0**
