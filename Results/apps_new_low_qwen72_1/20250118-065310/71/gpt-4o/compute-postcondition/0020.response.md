The `break` statement does not alter the values of the variables but exits the most immediate loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `digit`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove` remain unchanged. The only change is the control flow, which breaks out of the loop or conditional structure.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, `digit` is the next character in the reversed string `n`. If `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `to_remove` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
