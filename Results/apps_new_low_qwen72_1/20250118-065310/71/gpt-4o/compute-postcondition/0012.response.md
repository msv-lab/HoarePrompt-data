The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `n`, `k`, `digit`, and `count_zeros` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, `digit` will be the next character in the reversed string `n`, if the next `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 1. If the next `digit` is not '0', `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 2. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
