The function `func` reads two values, `n` and `k`, from user input, where `n` is a string representation of an integer and `k` is an integer. The function then processes the digits of `n` from right to left, counting the number of zeros (`count_zeros`) and the number of non-zero digits encountered (`to_remove`) until it finds `k` zeros. If `k` zeros are found, the function prints the number of non-zero digits encountered (`to_remove`). If fewer than `k` zeros are found, the function prints the length of `n` minus one. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` contains no zeros and when `k` is greater than the number of zeros in `n`. In both cases, the function will print the length of `n` minus one.
