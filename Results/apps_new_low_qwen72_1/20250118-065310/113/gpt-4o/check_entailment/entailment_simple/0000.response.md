### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is correctly read and parsed into the variable `data`. The number of cubes `n` is extracted, and the faces of each cube are stored in the `cubes` list. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `cube_faces` as a list of sets, where each set contains the unique digits on the faces of a cube. This transformation is necessary to efficiently check for the presence of digits.
   - The variable `x` is initialized to 0, and a while loop is used to increment `x` until it is no longer possible to form the number `x + 1` using the cubes. This approach ensures that the largest number `x` such that all numbers from 1 to `x` can be formed is found.
   - The function returns `x` after the loop terminates. This is the correct output according to the problem statement.

3. **Function `can_form_number`**:
   - The function takes a number `num` and checks if it can be formed using the digits on the cubes.
   - The number `num` is converted to a list of digits.
   - A list `used_cubes` is initialized to keep track of which cubes have been used.
   - For each digit in `num`, the function checks if the digit can be found in any unused cube. If a digit is found, the corresponding cube is marked as used.
   - If a digit cannot be found in any unused cube, the function returns `False`.
   - If all digits are found, the function returns `True`.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in both functions is sound and follows the problem requirements. The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as ensuring that no leading zeros are present in the formed numbers and that the digits 6 and 9 are treated as distinct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: **True**
