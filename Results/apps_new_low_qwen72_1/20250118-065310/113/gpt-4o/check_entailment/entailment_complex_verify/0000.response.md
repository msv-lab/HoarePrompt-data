Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the `func_1` function. Specifically, the `can_form_number` function is called within the `while` loop without passing the required arguments `cube_faces` and `n`. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because these variables are not defined within the scope of `can_form_number` when called in this manner.

Additionally, the original assessment correctly notes that the `while` loop could potentially run indefinitely if `can_form_number` always returns `True`. This could happen if the function does not properly handle the case where the number cannot be formed, leading to an infinite loop.

The annotated code also confirms that `cube_faces` and `n` are necessary for the `can_form_number` function to operate correctly, further validating the original assessment.

Given these issues, the original program is indeed incorrect and needs to be fixed by passing the required arguments to `can_form_number` and ensuring proper handling of the loop termination.

Final: **False**
