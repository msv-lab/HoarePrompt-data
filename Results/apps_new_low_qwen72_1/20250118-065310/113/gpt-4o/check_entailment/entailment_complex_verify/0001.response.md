Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues in the provided code:

1. **Scope of Variables**: The `cube_faces` variable is defined inside `func_1`, but it is used in `can_form_number`. This will indeed cause a `NameError` because `can_form_number` does not have access to `cube_faces`.

2. **Function Signature**: The `can_form_number` function should take an additional parameter `cube_faces` to avoid the scope issue. This is necessary to ensure that `can_form_number` has access to the cube faces.

3. **Initialization of `used_cubes`**: The `used_cubes` list should be initialized within the `can_form_number` function to ensure it is reset for each call. This is crucial because the `used_cubes` list needs to be fresh for each number being checked.

4. **While Loop Condition**: The `while` loop in `func_1` should check if `can_form_number` returns `True` before incrementing `x`. This ensures that the loop stops when the first number that cannot be formed is encountered.

Given these issues, the original program is indeed incorrect. The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues and should work as intended.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned.

Final: **False**
