You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.

At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.

To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.

The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.

Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.


-----Input-----

In first line integer n is given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.

Each of next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) — number on j-th face of i-th cube.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximum number x such Masha can make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
87
Input
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

Output
98


-----Note-----

In the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cubes):
    from itertools import product
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]

    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
    return x

#Function 2:
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `can_form_number` takes three parameters: `num` (a positive integer), `n` (a positive integer representing the number of cubes, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3), and `cube_faces` (a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube, with each digit ranging from 0 to 9). The function returns `True` if it is possible to form the number `num` using the digits available on the faces of the cubes, such that each cube is used at most once. If it is not possible to form the number, the function returns `False`. 

After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows:
- `num` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `cube_faces` remains unchanged.
- `digits` is a list of strings, where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, where each element is `True` if the corresponding cube was used to match a digit from `num`, and `False` otherwise. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `num` contains more unique digits than the number of cubes (`n`), the function will return `False` because not all digits can be matched.
- If any digit in `num` is not present on any of the cube faces, the function will return `False`.
- If `n` is less than the number of unique digits in `num`, the function will return `False` even if the same digit appears multiple times in `num`.
- If `num` is 0, the function will return `False` unless a cube face contains the digit '0'.
- The function assumes that each cube can only be used once, regardless of whether a digit appears multiple times in `num`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in the `func_1` function where it calls `can_form_number(x + 1)` without passing the necessary arguments (`cube_faces` and `n`). This will cause a `NameError` because `can_form_number` expects these arguments but they are not provided. Additionally, the `while` loop in `func_1` will run indefinitely if `can_form_number` always returns `True`, which can happen if the function does not properly handle the case where the number cannot be formed. 

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function that should work correctly:

```python
def func_1(n, cubes):
    from itertools import product
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]

    def can_form_number(num):
        digits = list(str(num))
        used_cubes = [False] * n
        for digit in digits:
            found = False
            for i in range(n):
                if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                    used_cubes[i] = True
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                return False
        return True

    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1, cube_faces, n):
        x += 1
    return x
```

However, since the original program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, it is considered incorrect.
