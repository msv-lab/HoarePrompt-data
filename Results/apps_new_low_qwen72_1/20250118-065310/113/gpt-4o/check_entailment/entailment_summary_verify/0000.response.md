### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a significant issue with the `func_1` function. Specifically, the `can_form_number` function is called without passing the necessary arguments (`cube_faces` and `n`), which will indeed result in a `NameError`. Additionally, the `while` loop in `func_1` could potentially run indefinitely if `can_form_number` always returns `True`.

Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function Signature Mismatch**:
   - The `can_form_number` function is defined to take three parameters: `num`, `n`, and `cube_faces`.
   - However, when `can_form_number` is called within `func_1`, it is only passed `x + 1`. This will raise a `NameError` because `can_form_number` expects `cube_faces` and `n` to be passed as well.

2. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - The `while` loop in `func_1` increments `x` as long as `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns `True`.
   - If `can_form_number` does not properly handle the case where the number cannot be formed, the loop will continue indefinitely.

3. **Corrected Version**:
   - The suggested correction in the original assessment is appropriate. By defining `can_form_number` inside `func_1` and passing the necessary arguments, the function can correctly determine if a number can be formed using the available cubes.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues and suggesting a correction. The original program, as written, is indeed incorrect due to the logical flaws mentioned.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
