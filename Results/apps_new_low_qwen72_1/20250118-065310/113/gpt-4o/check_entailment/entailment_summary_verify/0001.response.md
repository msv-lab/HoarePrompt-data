Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identified several issues in the provided code, which would indeed prevent the program from functioning as intended. Let's review these points and validate them against the function summary and the problem requirements:

1. **Scope of Variables**: The `cube_faces` variable is defined inside `func_1` but is used in `can_form_number`. This will indeed cause a `NameError` because `can_form_number` does not have access to `cube_faces`. To fix this, `cube_faces` should be passed as an argument to `can_form_number`.

2. **Function Signature**: The `can_form_number` function should take an additional parameter `cube_faces` to avoid the scope issue. This is necessary to ensure that the function has access to the cube faces data.

3. **Initialization of `used_cubes`**: The `used_cubes` list should be initialized within the `can_form_number` function to ensure it is reset for each call. This is crucial because `used_cubes` needs to be fresh for each number being checked.

4. **While Loop Condition**: The `while` loop in `func_1` should check if `can_form_number` returns `True` before incrementing `x`. This ensures that the loop stops when it is no longer possible to form the next number.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct in identifying the issues and providing a corrected version of the program. The corrected version addresses all the identified problems and should work as intended.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False** (the original program is incorrect due to the issues identified).
