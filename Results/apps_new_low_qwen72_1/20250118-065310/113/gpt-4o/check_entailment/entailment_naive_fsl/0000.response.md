Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in the `func_1` function where it calls `can_form_number(x + 1)` without passing the necessary arguments (`cube_faces` and `n`). This will cause a `NameError` because `can_form_number` expects these arguments but they are not provided. Additionally, the `while` loop in `func_1` will run indefinitely if `can_form_number` always returns `True`, which can happen if the function does not properly handle the case where the number cannot be formed. 

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function that should work correctly:

```python
def func_1(n, cubes):
    from itertools import product
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]

    def can_form_number(num):
        digits = list(str(num))
        used_cubes = [False] * n
        for digit in digits:
            found = False
            for i in range(n):
                if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                    used_cubes[i] = True
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                return False
        return True

    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1, cube_faces, n):
        x += 1
    return x
```

However, since the original program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, it is considered incorrect.
