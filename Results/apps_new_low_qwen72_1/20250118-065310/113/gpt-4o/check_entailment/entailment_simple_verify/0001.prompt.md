You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.

At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.

To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.

The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.

Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.


-----Input-----

In first line integer n is given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.

Each of next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) — number on j-th face of i-th cube.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximum number x such Masha can make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
87
Input
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

Output
98


-----Note-----

In the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the largest natural number \( x \) such that Masha can make all integers from 1 to \( x \) using her cubes. However, there are a few issues in the provided code that need to be addressed:

1. **Scope of Variables**: The `cube_faces` variable is defined inside `func_1`, but it is used in `can_form_number`. This will cause a `NameError` because `can_form_number` does not have access to `cube_faces`.

2. **Function Signature**: The `can_form_number` function should take an additional parameter `cube_faces` to avoid the scope issue.

3. **Initialization of `used_cubes`**: The `used_cubes` list should be initialized within the `can_form_number` function to ensure it is reset for each call.

4. **While Loop Condition**: The `while` loop in `func_1` should check if `can_form_number` returns `True` before incrementing `x`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, cubes):
    from itertools import product
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]

    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1, cube_faces):
        x += 1
    return x

def can_form_number(num, cube_faces):
    digits = list(str(num))
    used_cubes = [False] * len(cube_faces)
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        for i in range(len(cube_faces)):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True
```

With these corrections, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False** (due to the issues mentioned above, the original program is incorrect).
