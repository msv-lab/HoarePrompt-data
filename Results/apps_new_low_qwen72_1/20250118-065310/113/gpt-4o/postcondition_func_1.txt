The function `can_form_number` takes three parameters: `num` (a positive integer), `n` (a positive integer representing the number of cubes, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3), and `cube_faces` (a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube, with each digit ranging from 0 to 9). The function returns `True` if it is possible to form the number `num` using the digits available on the faces of the cubes, such that each cube is used at most once. If it is not possible to form the number, the function returns `False`. 

After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows:
- `num` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `cube_faces` remains unchanged.
- `digits` is a list of strings, where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, where each element is `True` if the corresponding cube was used to match a digit from `num`, and `False` otherwise. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `num` contains more unique digits than the number of cubes (`n`), the function will return `False` because not all digits can be matched.
- If any digit in `num` is not present on any of the cube faces, the function will return `False`.
- If `n` is less than the number of unique digits in `num`, the function will return `False` even if the same digit appears multiple times in `num`.
- If `num` is 0, the function will return `False` unless a cube face contains the digit '0'.
- The function assumes that each cube can only be used once, regardless of whether a digit appears multiple times in `num`.
