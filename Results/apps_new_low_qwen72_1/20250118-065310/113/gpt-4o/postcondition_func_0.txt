The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` of `n` lists, each containing 6 integers (0-9). It returns the largest integer `x` such that all numbers from 1 to `x` can be formed using the digits on the faces of the cubes, with the condition that at least one set in `cube_faces` must contain the digit 1. The function converts each list in `cubes` into a set to eliminate duplicate digits, and then iterates through numbers starting from 1, incrementing `x` until it finds a number that cannot be formed using the digits on the faces of the cubes. If the code is incomplete or missing the `can_form_number` function, the function may not work as intended.
