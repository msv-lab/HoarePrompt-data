The provided code snippet modifies the `used_cubes` list and the `found` variable, and then breaks out of the loop (assuming there is a loop surrounding this code, though it's not explicitly shown). Here's the analysis of the code's effect:

- The line `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the element at index `i` of the `used_cubes` list to `True`.
- The line `found = True` sets the `found` variable to `True`.
- The line `break` terminates the loop immediately, so no further iterations will occur.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1.
- `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where the element at index `i` is `True` if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]` and the rest are `False`.
- `found` is `True` if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`.
- `digit` is the next element in `digits`.
- `i` is 1.

After executing the code:
- The element at index `1` in `used_cubes` is set to `True`.
- The `found` variable is set to `True`.
- The loop is broken, so no further iterations will occur.

The final state is:
Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), digits is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from num, used_cubes[1] is True, found is True, digit is the next element in digits, i is 1**
