Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`. If `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, `used_cubes` is updated to [False, True, False] if n is 3 or [False, True] if n is 2, and `found` is True. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
