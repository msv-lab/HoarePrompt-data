To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1.
- `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where the elements at index 0 are True and the element at index 1 is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and the rest remain unchanged.
- `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and False otherwise.
- `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration.
- `i` is 1.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The loop is controlled by the variable `i` and the condition `i < n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than 2.

### Updated State:
- `num` remains a positive integer.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `cube_faces` remains a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` remains a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` remains a list where the elements at index 0 are True and the element at index 1 is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and the rest remain unchanged.
- `found` remains True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and False otherwise.
- `digit` remains the next element in `digits` after the current iteration.
- `i` is 2.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements at index 0 are True and the element at index 1 is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and the rest remain unchanged, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and False otherwise, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, `i` is 2**
