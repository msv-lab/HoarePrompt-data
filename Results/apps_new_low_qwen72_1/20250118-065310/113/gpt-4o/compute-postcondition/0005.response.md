The provided code snippet sets the `i`-th element of the `used_cubes` list to `True`, sets the `found` variable to `True`, and then breaks out of the loop. Given the initial conditions, we can infer the following:

- `used_cubes[i]` was initially `False` and is now set to `True`.
- `found` was initially `False` and is now set to `True`.
- The loop is broken, which means no further iterations will occur, but since the loop is not shown in the snippet, we only note the immediate effects of the given lines.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state is:

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the `i`-th element is `True` and the rest are `False`, `found` is True, `i` is 0**.
