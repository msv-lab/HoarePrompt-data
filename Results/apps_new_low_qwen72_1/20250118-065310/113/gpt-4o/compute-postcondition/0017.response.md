The only object in the loop head is the variable `digit`, which iterates over the list `digits`. Therefore, we can only adjust `digit`.

At the end of the last iteration, `digit` was the current element being processed from the list `digits`. For the loop to execute one more time, `digit` must move to the next element in the list `digits`.

Given that `digits` is a non-empty list of strings, if there are more elements in `digits` after the current `digit`, the loop will continue with the next element.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is to move `digit` to the next element in `digits`.

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where one element is `True` if the corresponding `digit` is found in the respective cube and the rest are `False`, `found` is True if the `digit` is found in any of the cubes, otherwise `found` is False. Additionally, `digit` is the next element in `digits`.**
