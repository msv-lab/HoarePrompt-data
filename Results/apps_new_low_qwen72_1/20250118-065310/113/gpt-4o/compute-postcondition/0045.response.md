Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements at indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False, `found` is True if `digit` was found in any of the `cube_faces` and False otherwise, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration or None if all digits have been processed, `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the range of `n`, which is the number of cubes.
   - For each iteration, it checks if the current cube (at index `i`) is not already used (`not used_cubes[i]`) and if the current digit (`digit`) is present in the current cube's faces (`digit in cube_faces[i]`).
   - If both conditions are met, the cube is marked as used (`used_cubes[i] = True`), and `found` is set to True. The loop then breaks, ending the current search for the digit.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, and `digits` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - **Changing Variables**:
     - `used_cubes`: Updated to mark cubes as used when a digit is found.
     - `found`: Set to True if a digit is found and a cube is used.
     - `digit`: Updated to the next digit in `digits` after each successful find.
     - `i`: Tracks the last index of `cube_faces` checked.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues until it finds a cube that can display the current digit and marks it as used.
   - If no such cube is found, `found` remains False, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - The loop will stop early if a digit is found and the cube is marked as used, or it will complete all iterations if no cube can display the digit.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships and invariants are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.
   - `used_cubes` will have True values at indices where a digit was found, and `found` will be True if any digit was successfully placed on a cube.
   - `digit` will be the next digit in the sequence or None if all digits have been processed.
   - `i` will be the last index checked or the maximum index if no more digits are found.
