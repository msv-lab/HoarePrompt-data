To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `digit` and `digits`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed.
- `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where the elements corresponding to the indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False.
- `found` is True.
- `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the last iteration.
- `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head mentions `digit` and `digits`.
2. **Adjusting `digit`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `digit` needs to be set to the next element in `digits`.
3. **Checking `digits`**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `digits`.

### Adjusted State:
- `digit` should be set to the next element in `digits`.
- The rest of the state remains unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements corresponding to the indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False, `found` is True, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, and `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.**
