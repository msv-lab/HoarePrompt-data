Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements corresponding to the indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False, `found` is False, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, `i` is 0. The current value of `used_cubes[i]` is False, and the current value of `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.***
