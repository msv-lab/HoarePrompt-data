The value of `found` is set to `False`. The other variables (`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where one element is `True` if the corresponding `digit` is found in the respective cube and the rest are `False`, `found` is False, `digit` is the next element in `digits`.**
