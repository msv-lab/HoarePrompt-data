Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where one element is `True` if the corresponding `digit` is found in the respective cube and the rest are `False`, `found` is True if the `digit` is found in any of the cubes, otherwise `found` is False. The loop will only execute once for the first cube where `digit` is found and `used_cubes[i]` is `False`.**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over the cubes (up to `n` times). It checks if the current cube has not been used (`not used_cubes[i]`) and if the current `digit` is on one of its faces (`digit in cube_faces[i]`). If both conditions are met, it marks the cube as used and sets `found` to True, then breaks out of the loop.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `used_cubes[i]`: This variable is updated to `True` for the first cube where `digit` is found and `used_cubes[i]` is `False`.
   - `found`: This variable is set to `True` if the `digit` is found on any cube.
   - `i`: This is the loop index, but since the loop breaks after finding the first match, `i` will only increment once.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will only execute once because it breaks after the first successful match. The `used_cubes` list will have one `True` value at the index of the cube where the `digit` is found, and the rest will remain `False`. The `found` variable will be `True` if a match is found, otherwise, it will remain `False`.

4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationships and invariants are consistent with the described iterations:
   - `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, and `digits` remain constant.
   - `used_cubes` is updated based on the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`.
   - `found` is updated to `True` if a match is found, otherwise, it remains `False`.
