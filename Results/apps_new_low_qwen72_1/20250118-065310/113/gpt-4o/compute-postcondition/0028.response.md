Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the element at index 1 is True. If `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]` and `used_cubes[2]` is initially False, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is True, and `i` remains 2. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `found` being the same as before and `i` still being 2.***
