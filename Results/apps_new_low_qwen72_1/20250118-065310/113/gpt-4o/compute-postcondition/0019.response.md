To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given state and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
- `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where one element is `True` if the corresponding `digit` is found in the respective cube and the rest are `False`.
- `found` is False.
- `digit` is the next element in `digits`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is the loop counter, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `i` must be 0 initially (as it is the first iteration).

### State Before the First Execution of the Loop:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0.
- `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where one element is `True` if the corresponding `digit` is found in the respective cube and the rest are `False`.
- `found` is False.
- `digit` is the next element in `digits`.
- `i` is 0.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where one element is `True` if the corresponding `digit` is found in the respective cube and the rest are `False`, `found` is False, `digit` is the next element in `digits`, `i` is 0**
