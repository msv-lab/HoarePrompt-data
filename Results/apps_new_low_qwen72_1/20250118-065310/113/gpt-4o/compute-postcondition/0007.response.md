To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
- `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where the `i`-th element is `True` if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and the rest are `False`.
- `found` is `True` if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `0` to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now 1.
- `n` remains the same.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the `i`-th element is `True` if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and the rest are `False`, `found` is True if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and `i` is 1.**
