The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the value `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n`, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Given the current state:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
- `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- If `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, `used_cubes` is updated to `[False, True, False]` if `n` is 3 or `[False, True]` if `n` is 2, and `found` is `True`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as described above. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i`**.
