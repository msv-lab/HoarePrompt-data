To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed.
- `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where the elements corresponding to the indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False.
- `found` is False.
- `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration.
- `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be a positive integer.
   - `i` must start at 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - The other variables (`num`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found`, `digit`) are not directly involved in the loop condition but are part of the initial state.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements corresponding to the indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False, `found` is False, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, `i` is 0**.
