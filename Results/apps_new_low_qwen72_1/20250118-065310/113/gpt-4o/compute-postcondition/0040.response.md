The provided code snippet modifies the `used_cubes` list and the `found` variable. Here's the analysis and the final output state:

- The line `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the element at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list to `True`. Given that `i` is 1, `used_cubes[1]` becomes `True`.
- The line `found = True` sets the `found` variable to `True`.
- The line `break` would typically exit a loop, but since there is no loop context provided in the snippet, this line alone doesn't affect the state. However, it implies that the code snippet is part of a larger loop structure, which we assume to be present.

Combining these effects, the final state is:

Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), digits is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from num, used_cubes is a list where the elements at index 0 and 1 are True and the rest remain unchanged, found is True, digit is the next element in digits after the current iteration, i is 1**
