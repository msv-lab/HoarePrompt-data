The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, which means for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the element at index 0 is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]` and the rest remain unchanged, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]` and False otherwise, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, `i` is 1**
