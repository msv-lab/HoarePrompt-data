To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions that control the loop's execution.

### Given State:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
- `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list of n False values.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for digit in digits:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the `digits` list.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `digits` must not be empty.

### Required State:
- `digits` must be a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n False values**.
