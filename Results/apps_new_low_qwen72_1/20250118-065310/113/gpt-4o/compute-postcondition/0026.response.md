The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the element at index 1 is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and the rest are False, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]`, `digit` is the next element in `digits`, and `i` is 2.**
