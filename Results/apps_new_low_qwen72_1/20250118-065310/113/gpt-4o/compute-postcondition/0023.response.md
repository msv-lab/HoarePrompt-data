To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. In a `for i in range(n):` loop, `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

2. **Variable `n`:** The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute another iteration.

3. **Other Variables:** The other variables (`num`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found`, and `digit`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not change based on the loop's control structure. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the element at index i is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]` and the rest are False, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the next element in `digits`, and `i` is 1.**
