The provided code snippet modifies the `used_cubes` list and the `found` variable. It sets the element at index `i` in `used_cubes` to `True`, updates `found` to `True`, and then breaks out of the loop (though there is no loop shown in the snippet).

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2.
- `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where the element at index 1 is `True` if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and the rest are `False`.
- `found` is `True` if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]`.
- `digit` is the next element in `digits`.
- `i` is 2.

After executing the code:
- `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, so the element at index 2 in `used_cubes` is now `True`.
- `found` is set to `True`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), digits is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from num, used_cubes is a list where the elements at index 1 and 2 are True and the rest are False, found is True, digit is the next element in digits, i is 2**.
