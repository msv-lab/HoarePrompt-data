Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements corresponding to the indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False, `found` is False, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, and `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
        used_cubes[i] = True
        found = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the element at index 0 is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]` and the rest remain unchanged, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]` and False otherwise, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, `i` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements at index 0 are True and the element at index 1 is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and the rest remain unchanged, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and False otherwise, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube, `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is [True, True, True] followed by the remaining unchanged elements if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]` and `not used_cubes[2]`, otherwise `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]` and `not used_cubes[2]`, otherwise `found` remains False, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, `i` is 2.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
