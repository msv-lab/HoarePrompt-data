Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the element at index i is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]` and the rest are False, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the next element in `digits`, and `i` is 0.***
