Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and the current `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True and `found` is set to True.***
