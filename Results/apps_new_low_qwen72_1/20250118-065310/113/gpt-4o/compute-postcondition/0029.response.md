Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements corresponding to the indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False, `found` is True if any `digit` was found in `cube_faces`, otherwise it remains False, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the last iteration, and `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.**

- **Constant Variables**: `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`.
- **Final Values of All Variables**:
  - `used_cubes`: Updated to reflect which cubes have been used to match a `digit`.
  - `found`: True if any `digit` was found in `cube_faces`, otherwise False.
  - `digit`: The next element in `digits` after the last iteration, or the last element if the loop completes without finding a match.
  - `i`: The last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.
- **Conditions Under Which the Loop Executes or Does Not Execute**:
  - The loop executes if there are unused cubes (`used_cubes[i]` is False) and the current `digit` is in the faces of the cube (`digit in cube_faces[i]`).
  - The loop does not execute further once a match is found (`break` statement is executed) or if no more unused cubes are available to check.
