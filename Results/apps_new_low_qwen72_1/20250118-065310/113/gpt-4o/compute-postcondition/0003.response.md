To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the components:

- `i` is the loop index variable.
- `n` is the number of iterations the loop will attempt to perform.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- The loop index `i` must start at 0.
- The value of `n` must be at least 1, because if `n` were 0 or negative, the loop would not execute even once.

The other variables (`num`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, and `found`) do not directly affect the condition for the loop to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should be modified to ensure that the loop can execute at least once:

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n False values, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
