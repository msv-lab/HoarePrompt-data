The provided code initializes two new variables based on the initial state. The first line converts the integer `num` into a string and then creates a list of its digits. The second line initializes a list `used_cubes` with `False` values, corresponding to the number of cubes `n`.

- `digits`: This list will contain the individual digits of `num` as strings.
- `used_cubes`: This list will have `n` elements, all initialized to `False`.

No other variables from the initial state are modified.

Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), digits is a list of strings where each string is a digit from num, used_cubes is a list of n False values**
