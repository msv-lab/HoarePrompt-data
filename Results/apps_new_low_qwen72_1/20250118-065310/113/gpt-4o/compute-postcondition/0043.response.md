The provided code snippet modifies the `used_cubes` list and the `found` variable, and then breaks out of the loop. Here's the analysis and the final output state:

- The line `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the element at index `i` (which is 2) in the `used_cubes` list to `True`.
- The line `found = True` sets the `found` variable to `True`.
- The line `break` indicates that the loop should terminate immediately, but since the context of the loop is not provided, we assume this is part of a larger loop structure that is not relevant to the final state.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2.
- `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube.
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` is a list where the elements at index 0 are `True` and the element at index 1 is `True` if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and the rest remain unchanged.
- `found` is `True` if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]` and `False` otherwise.
- `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration.
- `i` is 2.

After executing the code snippet:
- The element at index 2 in `used_cubes` is set to `True`.
- The `found` variable is set to `True`.

The final output state is:
Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube, digits is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from num, used_cubes is [True, True, True] followed by the remaining unchanged elements, found is True, digit is the next element in digits after the current iteration, i is 2**
