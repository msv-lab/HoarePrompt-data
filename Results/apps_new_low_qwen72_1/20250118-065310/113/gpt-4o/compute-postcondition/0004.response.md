Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n False values, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is False, and the current digit (from `digits`) is present in the `i`-th cube's faces (`cube_faces[i]`).***
