Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), digits is a list of strings where each string is a digit from num, used_cubes is a list of n False values
Code of the loop:
for digit in digits:
    found = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
            used_cubes[i] = True
            found = True
            break
    if not found:
        return False


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where one element is `True` if the corresponding `digit` is found in the respective cube and the rest are `False`, `found` is True if the `digit` is found in any of the cubes, otherwise `found` is False. Additionally, `found` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements corresponding to the indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False, `found` is True, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the last iteration, and `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the elements at indices where `digit` was found in `cube_faces` are True, and the rest are False, `found` is True, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration or None if all digits have been processed, `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
