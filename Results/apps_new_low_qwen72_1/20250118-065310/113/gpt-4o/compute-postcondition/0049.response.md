Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of unique digits in `num`, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where each element is `True` if the corresponding cube has been used to match a digit from `num`, and `False` otherwise, `found` is True if every digit in `num` is found in at least one of the cubes, otherwise the function returns False before completing the loop, `digit` is the last element in `digits` processed or None if all digits have been processed, `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.**
