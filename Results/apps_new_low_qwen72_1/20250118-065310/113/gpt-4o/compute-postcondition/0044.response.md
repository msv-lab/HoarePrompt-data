Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube, `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is [True, True, True] followed by the remaining unchanged elements if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]` and `not used_cubes[2]`, otherwise `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]` and `not used_cubes[2]`, otherwise `found` remains False, `digit` is the next element in `digits` after the current iteration, `i` is 2.***
