You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), and cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))

used_cubes = [False] * n
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of unique digits in `num`, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where each element is `True` if the corresponding cube has been used to match a digit from `num`, and `False` otherwise, `found` is True if every digit in `num` is found in at least one of the cubes, otherwise the function returns False before completing the loop, `digit` is the last element in `digits` processed or None if all digits have been processed, `i` is the last index of `cube_faces` checked or the maximum index of `cube_faces` if no more `digit` is found.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), and a list of `n` lists `cube_faces` where each sublist contains 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). It returns `True` if the conditions for forming the number are met; otherwise, it returns `False`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns False

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns True


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
