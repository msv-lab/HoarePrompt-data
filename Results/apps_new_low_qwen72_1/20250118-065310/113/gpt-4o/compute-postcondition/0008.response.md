The provided code snippet modifies the `used_cubes` list and the `found` variable based on the condition that `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]` at index `i` which is 1. Here's the analysis:

- The first line sets `used_cubes[i]` to `True`. Since `i` is 1, this means the second element (index 1) of `used_cubes` is set to `True`.
- The second line sets `found` to `True`.
- The third line is a `break` statement, which would exit the loop if this code were inside a loop. However, since the context of a loop is not provided, we assume this code is not part of a loop and the `break` statement does not affect the execution.

Given the initial state and the effects of the code:

- `num` remains a positive integer.
- `n` remains a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
- `cube_faces` remains a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` remains a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `used_cubes` now has the second element (index 1) set to `True`.
- `found` is set to `True`.

Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), digits is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from num, used_cubes is [False, True, False] if n is 3 or [False, True] if n is 2, found is True**
