The provided code snippet modifies the `used_cubes` list and sets the `found` variable to `True`. It also includes a `break` statement, which would exit a loop if this code were inside one. However, since we are focusing on the final state and not the context of a loop, we can infer that the loop would terminate after these lines execute.

- The line `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the element at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list to `True`.
- The line `found = True` sets the `found` variable to `True`.
- The line `break` would typically terminate a loop, but since we are not executing within a loop context here, it doesn't affect the state.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
- `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i`.

The final state after executing the provided code snippet is:
- `used_cubes[i]` is `True`.
- `found` is `True`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged:
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
- `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- `digits` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from `num`.
- `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i`.

Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), digits is a non-empty list of strings where each string is a digit from num, i is i + 1, n is greater than i, used_cubes[i] is True, found is True**
