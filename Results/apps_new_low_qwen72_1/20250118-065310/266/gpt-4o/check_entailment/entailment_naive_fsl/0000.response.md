Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue that could lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the `count_pleased` function is defined outside the scope where the `pizza_ingredients` and `friend_favorites` variables are defined. This means that `count_pleased` will not have access to these variables, leading to a NameError when the function is called.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 4
2 6 7
4 2 3 9 5
3 2 3 9
100 1 7
400 3 3 2 5
100 2 9 2
500 3 2 9 5
```

When the `func_1` function is called with this input, it will attempt to call `count_pleased`, which will raise a NameError because `pizza_ingredients` and `friend_favorites` are not in the scope of `count_pleased`.

To fix this, the `count_pleased` function should be defined inside `func_1` or the necessary variables should be passed as arguments to `count_pleased`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, m, friends, pizzas):
    from itertools import combinations
    from collections import defaultdict
    friend_favorites = [set(fav) for fav in friends]
    pizza_ingredients = [set(ing[1:]) for ing in pizzas]

    def count_pleased(p1, p2):
        combined_ingredients = pizza_ingredients[p1] | pizza_ingredients[p2]
        return sum(1 for fav in friend_favorites if fav <= combined_ingredients)

    best_count = 0
    best_cost = float('inf')
    best_pair = None
    for ((i, pi), (j, pj)) in combinations(enumerate(pizzas), 2):
        pleased_count = count_pleased(i, j)
        total_cost = pi[0] + pj[0]
        if pleased_count > best_count or (pleased_count == best_count and total_cost < best_cost):
            best_count = pleased_count
            best_cost = total_cost
            best_pair = (i + 1, j + 1)
    return best_pair
```

This corrected version ensures that `count_pleased` has access to the necessary variables and should work correctly for all potential cases.
