Reasoning:
The provided solution is logically sound and follows a systematic approach to solve the problem. Let's break down the key points and verify them step by step:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - `friend_favorites` is correctly constructed as a list of sets, where each set contains the favorite ingredients of a friend.
   - `pizza_ingredients` is correctly constructed as a list of sets, where each set contains the ingredients of a pizza.

2. **Combination Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible pairs of pizzas. This is appropriate because we need to consider every combination of two pizzas to find the optimal solution.

3. **Evaluation of Pairs**:
   - For each pair of pizzas, the function calls `count_pleased` to determine the number of friends who are pleased with the selection.
   - The `count_pleased` function correctly calculates the union of the ingredients of the two pizzas and counts the number of friends whose favorite ingredients are entirely contained within this union.
   - The function also calculates the total cost of the selected pair of pizzas.

4. **Selection of Best Pair**:
   - The best pair is chosen based on the criteria: maximize the number of pleased friends, and in case of a tie, minimize the total cost. This is implemented correctly by comparing the number of pleased friends and the total cost in the main loop.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the indices of the two pizzas that meet the criteria. The indices are adjusted by adding 1 to account for the 1-based indexing in the output.

Given the above analysis, the logic and implementation of the provided solution are correct. The use of sets for efficient ingredient checking and the combinatorial approach to evaluate all pairs ensure that the solution meets the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
