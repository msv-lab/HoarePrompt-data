Reasoning:  
The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count_pleased`. The goal is to select two pizzas that maximize the number of friends who are pleased while minimizing the total cost if there are multiple options with the same number of pleased friends.

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - `friend_favorites` is a list of sets, where each set contains the favorite ingredients of a friend.
   - `pizza_ingredients` is a list of sets, where each set contains the ingredients of a pizza.

2. **Combination Generation**:
   - The function uses `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible pairs of pizzas.

3. **Evaluation of Pairs**:
   - For each pair of pizzas, it calculates the number of friends who are pleased using the `count_pleased` function.
   - The `count_pleased` function checks how many friends have all their favorite ingredients covered by the union of the two pizzas' ingredients.
   - It also calculates the total cost of the selected pair of pizzas.

4. **Selection of Best Pair**:
   - The best pair is chosen based on the criteria: maximize the number of pleased friends, and in case of a tie, minimize the total cost.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the indices of the two pizzas that meet the criteria.

The logic and implementation seem correct, and the approach efficiently evaluates all pairs of pizzas to find the optimal solution.

Correctness: **True**
