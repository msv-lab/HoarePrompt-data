### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Data Preparation:**
   - The main script correctly parses the input data into the `friends` and `pizzas` lists.
   - `friends` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the favorite ingredients of a friend.
   - `pizzas` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the price of the pizza and a list of its ingredients.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible pairs of pizzas.
   - For each pair of pizzas, it calculates the number of friends who are pleased using the `count_pleased` function.
   - It keeps track of the best pair of pizzas that maximize the number of pleased friends and minimize the total cost.
   - The function returns the indices of the best pair of pizzas (1-based).

3. **Function `count_pleased`:**
   - This function takes two pizza indices and calculates the union of their ingredients.
   - It then counts how many friends have all their favorite ingredients covered by this union.
   - The function correctly uses set operations to determine the union of ingredients and to check if a friend's favorites are a subset of the combined ingredients.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The problem description and the function assumptions indicate that the input is always valid and within the specified constraints.
   - The function handles the case where no combination of pizzas can please any friends by returning `None` in `func_1`, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. However, the function is designed to handle such cases gracefully.

5. **Overall Functionality:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the best pair of pizzas that maximize the number of pleased friends and minimize the total cost.
   - The use of set operations and combinatorial generation ensures that the solution is both efficient and accurate.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem description.
