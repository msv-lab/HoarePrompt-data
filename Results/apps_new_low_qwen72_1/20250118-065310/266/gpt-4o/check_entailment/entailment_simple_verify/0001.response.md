Reasoning:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The main script correctly reads the input and processes it into the `friends` and `pizzas` lists. Each friend's favorite ingredients are stored as a list, and each pizza is stored as a tuple containing the price and a list of ingredients.
   - In `func_1`, `friend_favorites` is correctly converted to a list of sets, and `pizza_ingredients` is similarly converted to a list of sets. This conversion is necessary for efficient set operations.

2. **Combination Generation**:
   - The use of `itertools.combinations` to generate all pairs of pizzas is appropriate. This ensures that every possible pair of pizzas is considered.

3. **Evaluation of Pairs**:
   - The `count_pleased` function correctly computes the number of friends who are pleased by the union of the ingredients of the two pizzas. The condition `fav <= combined_ingredients` ensures that all favorite ingredients of a friend are included in the combined ingredients of the two pizzas.
   - The total cost of the selected pair of pizzas is calculated correctly.

4. **Selection of Best Pair**:
   - The selection logic in `func_1` is correct. It updates `best_count`, `best_cost`, and `best_pair` based on the criteria: maximize the number of pleased friends, and in case of a tie, minimize the total cost.
   - The indices of the best pair are adjusted to be 1-based, which matches the problem's requirement.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the indices of the two pizzas that meet the criteria. If no combination of two pizzas pleases any friends, it returns `None`.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and the original assessment. The code correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including input parsing, combination generation, evaluation, and selection of the best pair.

Final: **True**
