The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)), `m` (a positive integer where \(2 \leq m \leq 10^5\)), `friends` (a list of lists where each inner list represents the favorite ingredients of a friend, and each element in the inner list is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive), and `pizzas` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the price of the pizza followed by a list of distinct integers representing the ingredients of the pizza, each between 1 and 9 inclusive). The function returns a pair of pizza indices (1-based) that achieve the maximum number of friends pleased and the minimum total cost among all such pairs. If no combination of two pizzas pleases any friends, the function returns `None`. The function ensures that the returned pair of pizzas maximizes the number of friends pleased, and in case of a tie, minimizes the total cost. Edge cases include scenarios where no two pizzas can please any friends, or where the input lists are empty or contain invalid data, though the function assumes valid inputs as per the constraints.
