n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^5. friends is a list of n lists, where each sublist i contains an integer f_i (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 9) followed by f_i distinct integers b_{i1}, b_{i2}, ..., b_{if_i} (1 ≤ b_{it} ≤ 9). pizzas is a list of m lists, where each sublist j contains an integer c_j (1 ≤ c_j ≤ 10^9), an integer r_j (1 ≤ r_j ≤ 9), and r_j distinct integers a_{j1}, a_{j2}, ..., a_{jr_j} (1 ≤ a_{jt} ≤ 9).
