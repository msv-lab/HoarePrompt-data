The function `func_1` accepts four parameters:

- `n`: A positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), representing the number of friends.
- `m`: A positive integer where \(2 \leq m \leq 10^5\), representing the number of pizzas.
- `friends`: A list of lists, where each inner list represents the favorite ingredients of a friend, and each element in the inner list is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `pizzas`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the price of the pizza (an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive) followed by a list of distinct integers representing the ingredients of the pizza, each between 1 and 9 inclusive.

The function returns the pair of pizza indices (1-based) that achieve the best count and best cost. If no combination of two pizzas pleases any friends, it returns `None`.
