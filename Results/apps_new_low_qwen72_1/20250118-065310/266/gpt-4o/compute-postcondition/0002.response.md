The function `count_pleased` accepts two parameters, `p1` and `p2`, which are integers representing the indices of two different pizzas. It also implicitly uses two additional data structures: `pizza_ingredients`, a dictionary where keys are pizza indices and values are sets of integers representing the ingredients of the pizzas, and `friend_favorites`, a list of sets where each set contains the favorite ingredients of a friend, represented as integers. The function returns the count of friends whose favorite ingredients are entirely contained within the union of the ingredients of the pizzas at indices `p1` and `p2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `p1` and `p2`, both integers representing indices of pizzas. It returns the count of friends whose favorite ingredients are entirely contained within the union of the ingredients of the pizzas at indices `p1` and `p2`.**
