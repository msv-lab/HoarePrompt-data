Functionality: ** The function `count_pleased` takes two integer parameters `p1` and `p2`, representing the indices of two different pizzas. It calculates the union of the ingredients of these two pizzas and returns the count of friends whose favorite ingredients are entirely contained within this union. The function assumes that `pizza_ingredients` is a dictionary where the keys are pizza indices and the values are sets of integers representing the ingredients, and `friend_favorites` is a list of sets, where each set contains the favorite ingredients of a friend. If either `p1` or `p2` is out of bounds or invalid (i.e., not valid indices in `pizza_ingredients`), the function may raise an error. Additionally, if `friend_favorites` is empty, the function will return 0. **
