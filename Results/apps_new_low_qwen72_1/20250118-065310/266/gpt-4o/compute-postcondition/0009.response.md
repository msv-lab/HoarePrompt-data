Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), m is a positive integer where \(2 \leq m \leq 10^5\), friends is a list of lists, pizzas is a list of tuples with at least 2 elements, friend_favorites is a list of sets, pizza_ingredients is a list of sets, i is 0, j is 2, pi is the first pizza tuple, pj is the third pizza tuple, pleased_count is the result of count_pleased(0, 2), total_cost is pi[0] + pj[0]. If `pleased_count` > `best_count` or (`pleased_count` == `best_count` and `total_cost` < `best_cost`), then `best_count` is updated to `pleased_count`, `best_cost` is updated to `total_cost`, and `best_pair` is set to (1, 3). Otherwise, `best_count`, `best_cost`, and `best_pair` remain unchanged.***
