Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), m is a positive integer where \(2 \leq m \leq 10^5\), friends is a list of lists, pizzas is a list of tuples with at least 4 elements, friend_favorites is a list of sets, pizza_ingredients is a list of sets, i is 0, j is 3, pi is the first pizza tuple, pj is the fourth pizza tuple, pleased_count is the result of count_pleased(0, 3), total_cost is pi[0] + pj[0]. If pleased_count > best_count or (pleased_count == best_count and total_cost < best_cost), then best_count is updated to pleased_count, best_cost is updated to total_cost, and best_pair is set to (1, 4). Otherwise, best_count, best_cost, and best_pair remain unchanged.***
