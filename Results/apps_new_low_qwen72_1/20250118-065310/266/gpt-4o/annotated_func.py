    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), m is a positive integer where \(2 \leq m \leq 10^5\), friends is a list of lists, pizzas is a list of tuples with at least 2 elements, friend_favorites is a list of sets, pizza_ingredients is a list of sets, best_count is the maximum number of friends that can be pleased with any two pizzas, best_cost is the minimum total cost of the two pizzas that please the maximum number of friends, best_pair is the pair of pizza indices (1-based) that achieve the best_count and best_cost. If no combination of two pizzas pleases any friends, best_count remains 0, best_cost remains infinity, and best_pair remains None.

    #The program returns the pair of pizza indices (1-based) that achieve the best_count and best_cost. If no combination of two pizzas pleases any friends, it returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)), `m` (a positive integer where \(2 \leq m \leq 10^5\)), `friends` (a list of lists where each inner list represents the favorite ingredients of a friend, and each element in the inner list is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive), and `pizzas` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the price of the pizza followed by a list of distinct integers representing the ingredients of the pizza, each between 1 and 9 inclusive). The function returns a pair of pizza indices (1-based) that achieve the maximum number of friends pleased and the minimum total cost among all such pairs. If no combination of two pizzas pleases any friends, the function returns `None`. The function ensures that the returned pair of pizzas maximizes the number of friends pleased, and in case of a tie, minimizes the total cost. Edge cases include scenarios where no two pizzas can please any friends, or where the input lists are empty or contain invalid data, though the function assumes valid inputs as per the constraints.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: p1 and p2 are integers representing the indices of two different pizzas, where 0 <= p1 < m and 0 <= p2 < m and p1 != p2. pizza_ingredients is a dictionary where keys are pizza indices and values are sets of integers representing the ingredients of the pizzas. friend_favorites is a list of sets, where each set contains the favorite ingredients of a friend, represented as integers.
def count_pleased(p1, p2):
    combined_ingredients = pizza_ingredients[p1] | pizza_ingredients[p2]
    return sum(1 for fav in friend_favorites if fav <= combined_ingredients)
    #The program returns the count of friends whose favorite ingredients (represented as sets in `friend_favorites`) are entirely contained within the union of the ingredients of the pizzas at indices `p1` and `p2` in the `pizza_ingredients` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count_pleased` takes two integer parameters `p1` and `p2`, representing the indices of two different pizzas. It calculates the union of the ingredients of these two pizzas and returns the count of friends whose favorite ingredients are entirely contained within this union. The function assumes that `pizza_ingredients` is a dictionary where the keys are pizza indices and the values are sets of integers representing the ingredients, and `friend_favorites` is a list of sets, where each set contains the favorite ingredients of a friend. If either `p1` or `p2` is out of bounds or invalid (i.e., not valid indices in `pizza_ingredients`), the function may raise an error. Additionally, if `friend_favorites` is empty, the function will return 0.
