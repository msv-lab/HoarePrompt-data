The function `func_1` takes three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ m ≤ n`. It calculates a score based on the following logic:

1. If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the score is simply `m % MOD`.
2. If `m` is greater than `n - n // k`, the score is calculated as \((m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) \times k + k \times (2^{(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1))} - 1) \times 2^{MOD - 2}) \mod MOD\).

The function returns the calculated score. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function call. The function handles edge cases such as when `m` is exactly `n - n // k` and when `m` is significantly larger than `n - n // k`. However, the function assumes that `MOD` is defined elsewhere in the code, and it does not handle the case where `MOD` might be zero or negative, which could lead to errors in the modulo operation.
