### Reasoning:

Let's break down the function `func_1` step by step and verify its correctness against the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   ```python
   MOD = 1000000009
   (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
   print(func_1(n, m, k))
   ```
   This part is straightforward. It reads the input and calls `func_1` with the parsed integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, m, k):
       max_full_sets = m // k
       remaining_correct = m % k
       if m <= n - n // k:
           score = m % MOD
       else:
           excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
           remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
           score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
       return score
   ```

3. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - **Step 1: Calculate `max_full_sets` and `remaining_correct`:**
     ```python
     max_full_sets = m // k
     remaining_correct = m % k
     ```
     This correctly calculates the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers and the remaining correct answers that do not form a full set.

   - **Step 2: Check if `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`:**
     ```python
     if m <= n - n // k:
         score = m % MOD
     ```
     This condition checks if the number of correct answers `m` is less than or equal to the maximum possible number of correct answers without triggering any doubling. If true, the score is simply `m`.

   - **Step 3: Calculate the score if `m` is greater than `n - n // k`:**
     ```python
     else:
         excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
         remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
         score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
     ```
     - **Excess Full Sets Calculation:**
       ```python
       excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
       ```
       This calculates the number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers that are in excess of the maximum possible without triggering any doubling.

     - **Remaining Correct Answers:**
       ```python
       remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
       ```
       This calculates the remaining correct answers after accounting for the excess full sets.

     - **Score Calculation:**
       ```python
       score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
       ```
       This formula correctly calculates the score by adding the remaining correct answers and the contribution from the excess full sets, using modular arithmetic to ensure the result is within the required modulo `1000000009`.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `5 3 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Calculation:
     - `max_full_sets = 3 // 2 = 1`
     - `remaining_correct = 3 % 2 = 1`
     - Since `3 <= 5 - 5 // 2 = 3`, the score is `3 % 1000000009 = 3`.
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 4 2`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Calculation:
     - `max_full_sets = 4 // 2 = 2`
     - `remaining_correct = 4 % 2 = 0`
     - Since `4 > 5 - 5 // 2 = 3`, we need to calculate the excess full sets:
       - `excess_full_sets = 2 - (5 - 4) // (2 - 1) = 2 - 1 = 1`
       - `remaining_correct_answers = 4 - 1 * 2 = 2`
       - `score = (2 + 2 * (2^1 - 1) * 2^(1000000009 - 2) % 1000000009) % 1000000009`
       - `score = (2 + 2 * 1 * 500000005) % 1000000009`
       - `score = (2 + 1000000010) % 1000000009 = 6`
   - Output: `6` (Correct)
