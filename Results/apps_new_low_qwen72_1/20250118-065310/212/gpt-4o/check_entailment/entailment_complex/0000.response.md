Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**: The initial setup correctly reads the input values and assigns them to variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the minimum score based on the rules provided.

3. **Max Full Sets Calculation**: The calculation `max_full_sets = m // k` correctly determines the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers.

4. **Remaining Correct Answers Calculation**: The calculation `remaining_correct = m % k` correctly determines the number of remaining correct answers after forming full sets of `k`.

5. **Score Calculation**:
   - The condition `if (m <= n - n // k)` checks if the number of correct answers `m` is less than or equal to the maximum number of non-resetting correct answers possible without exceeding the total number of questions `n`.
   - If true, the score is simply `m % MOD`, which is correct because no doubling occurs.
   - If false, the score is calculated using the formula:
     ```python
     excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
     remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
     score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
     ```
     This formula correctly accounts for the number of times the score is doubled due to reaching `k` consecutive correct answers and then resets.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `m` is exactly `n - n // k` and when `m` is significantly larger than `n - n // k`.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result is within the required range and handles large numbers efficiently.

7. **Assumptions**:
   - The function assumes `MOD` is defined elsewhere in the code, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.
   - The function does not handle the case where `MOD` might be zero or negative, but since `MOD` is defined as `1000000009`, this is not a concern.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
