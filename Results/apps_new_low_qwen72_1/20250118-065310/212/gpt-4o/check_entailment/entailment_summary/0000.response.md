Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the minimum possible score Manao can achieve given the constraints of the quiz. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It defines a constant `MOD` as \(10^9 + 9\) to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the score based on the given parameters.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the score is simply `m % MOD`.
     - This case handles the scenario where the number of correct answers is small enough that no doubling of the score occurs.
   - **Case 2**: If `m` is greater than `n - n // k`, the score is calculated more complexly.
     - `max_full_sets` is the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers.
     - `remaining_correct` is the number of correct answers that do not form a full set.
     - `excess_full_sets` is the number of full sets that exceed the threshold where doubling would occur.
     - `remaining_correct_answers` is the number of correct answers left after accounting for the excess full sets.
     - The score is then calculated using the formula:
       \[
       \text{score} = (remaining\_correct\_answers + k \times (2^{excess\_full\_sets} - 1) \times 2^{MOD - 2}) \mod MOD
       \]
     - This formula accounts for the points from the remaining correct answers and the points from the full sets, including the doubling effect.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `m` is exactly `n - n // k`.
   - It also handles the case where `m` is significantly larger than `n - n // k`.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The use of `pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)` ensures that the power operation is performed under modulo `MOD`.
   - The term `2**(MOD - 2) % MOD` is used to find the modular inverse of 2, which is necessary for the division in the score calculation.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function handles all edge cases and uses appropriate mathematical operations to ensure the result is within the bounds specified by `MOD`.

Correctness: **True**
