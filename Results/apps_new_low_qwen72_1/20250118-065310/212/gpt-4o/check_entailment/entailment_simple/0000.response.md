Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze its logic and ensure that it matches the problem requirements and constraints. Let's break down the key components:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets`) and the remaining correct answers after forming these full sets (`remaining_correct`).
   - It then checks if `m` (the total number of correct answers) is less than or equal to `n - n // k`. This condition is used to determine if the score can be minimized without any full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers.
   - If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the score is simply `m % MOD`.
   - If `m` is greater than `n - n // k`, the program calculates the number of excess full sets (`excess_full_sets`) and the remaining correct answers after accounting for these excess full sets (`remaining_correct_answers`).
   - The score is then calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{score} = \left(\text{remaining\_correct\_answers} + k \times (2^{\text{excess\_full\_sets}} - 1) \times 2^{MOD - 2}\right) \mod MOD
     \]
   - Finally, the function returns the score.

3. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The program uses modulo operations to ensure that the result fits within the required range (1000000009).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k` and where `m` is greater than `n - n // k`.

5. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The mathematical logic for calculating the score, including the use of modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverse, is correct and follows the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem statement and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
