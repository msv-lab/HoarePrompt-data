### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we will follow the steps outlined in the problem description and compare them with the logic implemented in the program. We will also use the annotated version to validate the program's behavior.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Calculating Full Sets**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets`) and the remaining correct answers (`remaining_correct`).
   - This is done using integer division and modulus operations: `max_full_sets = m // k` and `remaining_correct = m % k`.

3. **Initial Score Calculation**:
   - The program checks if the number of correct answers `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`.
   - If true, the score is simply the number of correct answers modulo `MOD`.
   - This condition ensures that the number of correct answers is not enough to form any full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers, so the score is just `m`.

4. **Excess Full Sets Calculation**:
   - If the condition is false, the program calculates the number of excess full sets (`excess_full_sets`) and the remaining correct answers after accounting for these full sets.
   - The formula used is `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`.
   - This formula accounts for the fact that each full set of `k` correct answers resets the counter and potentially doubles the score.

5. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{score} = \left( \text{remaining\_correct\_answers} + k \times (\text{pow}(2, \text{excess\_full\_sets}, \text{MOD}) - 1) \times \text{pow}(2, \text{MOD} - 2, \text{MOD}) \right) \% \text{MOD}
     \]
   - This formula correctly handles the doubling of the score for each full set of `k` correct answers and ensures the result is taken modulo `MOD`.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the required range.
   - The use of `pow` with the third argument `MOD` for modular exponentiation is correct and efficient.

### Validation with Examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `5 3 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Calculation:
     - `max_full_sets = 3 // 2 = 1`
     - `remaining_correct = 3 % 2 = 1`
     - Since `3 <= 5 - 5 // 2` (which is `3`), the score is `3 % 1000000009 = 3`.
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `5 4 2`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Calculation:
     - `max_full_sets = 4 // 2 = 2`
     - `remaining_correct = 4 % 2 = 0`
     - Since `4 > 5 - 5 // 2` (which is `3`), we calculate:
       - `excess_full_sets = 2 - (5 - 4) // (2 - 1) = 2 - 1 = 1`
       - `remaining_correct_answers = 4 - 1 * 2 = 2`
       - `score = (2 + 2 * (2^1 - 1) * 2^(1000000009 - 2)) % 1000000009`
       - Simplifying, `score = (2 + 2 * 1 * 500000004) % 1000000009 = (2 + 1000000008) % 1000000009 = 6`
   - The program correctly outputs `6`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the calculation of the minimum possible score, taking into account the constraints and the rules for doubling the score. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result is within the required range.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
