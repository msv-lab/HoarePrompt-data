Reasoning: 

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It calls `func_1` with these values.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - **Calculate Maximum Full Sets**:
     ```python
     max_full_sets = m // k
     remaining_correct = m % k
     ```
     This correctly calculates the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers and the remaining correct answers.

   - **Check for Simple Case**:
     ```python
     if m <= n - n // k:
         score = m % MOD
     ```
     This condition checks if the number of correct answers `m` is less than or equal to the maximum possible without triggering any doubling. If true, the score is simply `m % MOD`.

   - **Complex Case Calculation**:
     ```python
     else:
         excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
         remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
         score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
     ```
     - **Excess Full Sets**:
       ```python
       excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
       ```
       This calculates the number of full sets that exceed the maximum possible without triggering any doubling.
     - **Remaining Correct Answers**:
       ```python
       remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
       ```
       This calculates the remaining correct answers after accounting for the excess full sets.
     - **Score Calculation**:
       ```python
       score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
       ```
       This calculates the final score using modular arithmetic to ensure it is within the required modulo `1000000009`.

3. **Edge Cases and Mathematical Validity**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`.
   - The complex case calculation ensures that the score is correctly computed even when there are multiple full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result is always within the required range.

4. **Validation of Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program correctly handles all potential cases and edge conditions.
   - The logic and mathematical operations used are sound and cover all necessary scenarios.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible score for Manao given the constraints.

Final: **True**
