You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of n consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.

Manao remembers that he has answered exactly m questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Input-----

The single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 0 ≤ m ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3 2

Output
3

Input
5 4 2

Output
6



-----Note-----

Sample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.

Sample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.

Also note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is a smaller number.

- Program: 
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    if m <= n - n // k:
        score = m % MOD
    else:
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return score



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k

remaining_correct = m % k
    if (m <= n - n // k) :
        score = m % MOD
    else :
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)

remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k

score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1
    ) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq n\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\), `max_full_sets` is \(m // k\), `remaining_correct` is \(m \% k\). If \(m \leq n - n // k\), `score` is \(m \% MOD\). If \(m > n - n // k\), `excess_full_sets` is \(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)\), `remaining_correct_answers` is \(m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) \times k\), and `score` is \((m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) \times k + k \times (2^{(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1))} - 1) \times 2^{MOD - 2}) \mod MOD\).
    return score
    #The program returns `score` which is calculated as follows: If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, `score` is `m % MOD`. If `m` is greater than `n - n // k`, `score` is \((m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) \times k + k \times (2^{(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1))} - 1) \times 2^{MOD - 2}) \mod MOD\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ m ≤ n`. It calculates a score based on the following logic:

1. If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the score is simply `m % MOD`.
2. If `m` is greater than `n - n // k`, the score is calculated as \((m - (m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1)) \times k + k \times (2^{(m // k - (n - m) // (k - 1))} - 1) \times 2^{MOD - 2}) \mod MOD\).

The function returns the calculated score. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function call. The function handles edge cases such as when `m` is exactly `n - n // k` and when `m` is significantly larger than `n - n // k`. However, the function assumes that `MOD` is defined elsewhere in the code, and it does not handle the case where `MOD` might be zero or negative, which could lead to errors in the modulo operation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify if it accurately computes the minimum possible score Manao can achieve in the quiz based on the provided problem description. Let's break down the logic step by step:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - This is correctly done using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Calculating Full Sets**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets`) and the remaining correct answers (`remaining_correct`).
   - This is done using integer division and modulus operations: `max_full_sets = m // k` and `remaining_correct = m % k`.

3. **Initial Score Calculation**:
   - The program checks if the number of correct answers `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`.
   - If true, the score is simply the number of correct answers modulo `MOD`.
   - This condition ensures that the number of correct answers is not enough to form any full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers, so the score is just `m`.

4. **Excess Full Sets Calculation**:
   - If the condition is false, the program calculates the number of excess full sets (`excess_full_sets`) and the remaining correct answers after accounting for these full sets.
   - The formula used is `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`.
   - This formula accounts for the fact that each full set of `k` correct answers resets the counter and potentially doubles the score.

5. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{score} = \left( \text{remaining\_correct\_answers} + k \times (\text{pow}(2, \text{excess\_full\_sets}, \text{MOD}) - 1) \times \text{pow}(2, \text{MOD} - 2, \text{MOD}) \right) \% \text{MOD}
     \]
   - This formula correctly handles the doubling of the score for each full set of `k` correct answers and ensures the result is taken modulo `MOD`.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the required range.
   - The use of `pow` with the third argument `MOD` for modular exponentiation is correct and efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the calculation of the minimum possible score, taking into account the constraints and the rules for doubling the score. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result is within the required range.

Therefore, the program is correct.
