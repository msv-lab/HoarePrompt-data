Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided solution appears to correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the minimum possible score Manao can achieve given the constraints. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets`) and the remaining correct answers (`remaining_correct`). It then checks if the number of correct answers `m` is less than or equal to the maximum possible without triggering any doubling, and if so, returns `m` directly. Otherwise, it calculates the excess full sets and the remaining correct answers, and uses modular arithmetic to compute the final score, ensuring it is within the required modulo `1000000009`. The logic and the mathematical operations used seem to cover all edge cases and potential inputs, making the program correct.
