The provided code calculates two new variables based on the initial values of `m` and `k`:

- `max_full_sets` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `k`, which gives the number of complete sets of size `k` that can be formed from `m`.
- `remaining_correct` is calculated as the remainder of `m` divided by `k`, which gives the number of elements left over after forming as many complete sets of size `k` as possible.

Given the initial state where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n, the values of `n` remain unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `m` and `k` are used to compute `max_full_sets` and `remaining_correct`.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ n, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, max_full_sets is m // k, remaining_correct is m % k**
