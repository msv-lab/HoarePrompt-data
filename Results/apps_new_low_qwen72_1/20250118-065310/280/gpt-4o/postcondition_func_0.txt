The function reads two sets of integers from the user input: `v1` and `v2` (1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100), and `t` and `d` (2 ≤ t ≤ 100, 0 ≤ d ≤ 10). It initializes a list `speeds` of length `t` with all elements set to 0. The first element of `speeds` is set to `v1`, and the last element is set to `v2`. For each index `i` from 1 to `t-1`, the `i`-th element of `speeds` is updated to the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` or `v2` plus the remaining steps multiplied by `d`. Finally, the function calculates the total distance traveled by summing all elements in the `speeds` list and prints this total distance. The function does not return any value; it only prints the total distance. The function does not handle any edge cases mentioned in the annotations (e.g., "Equal speeds", "Short duration", "Long distance").
