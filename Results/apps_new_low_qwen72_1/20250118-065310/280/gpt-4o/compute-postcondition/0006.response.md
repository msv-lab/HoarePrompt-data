Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the changes:

- `v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100)
- `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100)
- `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10)
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` with specific initial conditions:
  - The first element is `v1`.
  - The second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
  - The third element is `min(v1 + 2 * d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`.
  - The last element is `v2`.
  - All other elements are 0.
- `i` is 3

The code snippet:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the current value of `speeds[i - 1]`:**
   - `i` is 3, so `speeds[i - 1]` is `speeds[2]`.
   - According to the initial state, `speeds[2]` is `min(v1 + 2 * d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`.

2. **Calculate `speeds[i - 1] + d`:**
   - This is `min(v1 + 2 * d, v2 + (t - 3) * d) + d`.

3. **Calculate `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`:**
   - Since `i` is 3, this becomes `v2 + (t - 3 - 1) * d`, which simplifies to `v2 + (t - 4) * d`.

4. **Determine the new value of `speeds[i]`:**
   - `speeds[3]` will be the minimum of `min(v1 + 2 * d, v2 + (t - 3) * d) + d` and `v2 + (t - 4) * d`.

### Resulting Output State:
- `v1` remains an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100).
- `v2` remains an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100).
- `t` remains an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `d` remains an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10).
- `speeds` is updated at index 3:
  - `speeds[3] = min(min(v1 + 2 * d, v2 + (t - 3) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 4) * d)`.
- `i` remains 3.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the third element is `min(v1 + 2 * d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, the fourth element is `min(min(v1 + 2 * d, v2 + (t - 3) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 4) * d)`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 3**.
