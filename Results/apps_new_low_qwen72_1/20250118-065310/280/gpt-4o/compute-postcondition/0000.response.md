The provided code reads two sets of inputs and initializes a list `speeds` with a length equal to `t`. The first element of `speeds` is set to `v1`, and the last element is set to `v2`.

- The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `v1` and `v2`.
- The second line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `d`.
- The third line initializes a list `speeds` with `t` elements, all set to 0.
- The fourth line sets the first element of `speeds` to `v1`.
- The fifth line sets the last element of `speeds` to `v2`.

Given the initial state and the provided code, the final state is:

Output State: **v1 is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), v2 is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), t is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), d is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), speeds is a list of length t where the first element is v1, the last element is v2, and all other elements are 0**
