The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `t` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the third element is `min(v1 + 2d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 3**
