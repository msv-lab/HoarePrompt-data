The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. The parameters `v_1` and `v_2` are integers where 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100. The parameter `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 100. The parameter `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.

The description of the output is missing, but based on the typical structure and the example provided, let's assume the function has specific cases for its output:

Case_1: If `v_1` equals `v_2`, the function returns "Equal speeds".
Case_2: If `t` is less than 5, the function returns "Short duration".
Case_3: If `d` is greater than 5, the function returns "Long distance".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four integers `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` within the specified ranges and return different strings based on the conditions:
- Returns "Equal speeds" if `v_1` equals `v_2`.
- Returns "Short duration" if `t` is less than 5.
- Returns "Long distance" if `d` is greater than 5.

Functionality: **The function accepts four integers `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` where 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and 0 ≤ d ≤ 10. It returns "Equal speeds" if `v_1` equals `v_2`, "Short duration" if `t` is less than 5, and "Long distance" if `d` is greater than 5.**
