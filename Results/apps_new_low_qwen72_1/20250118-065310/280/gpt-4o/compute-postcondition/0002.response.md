The code snippet modifies the `speeds` list at index `i` based on a calculation involving the previous index and the given variables. Let's break down the changes:

- `speeds[i]` is updated to the minimum value between `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`.
- `speeds[i - 1]` is `v1` because `i` is 1, and `speeds[0]` is `v1`.
- `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` is calculated using the current values of `v2`, `t`, `i`, and `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100)
- `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100)
- `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10)
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements are 0
- `i` is 1

The new value of `speeds[1]` is:
- `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 1 - 1) * d)` which simplifies to `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`

Thus, the output state is:
- `v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100)
- `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100)
- `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10)
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements are 0
- `i` is 1

Output State: **`v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1**
