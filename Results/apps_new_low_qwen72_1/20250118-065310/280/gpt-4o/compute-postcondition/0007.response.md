Output State: **v1 is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), v2 is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), t is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), d is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), speeds is a list of length t where the first element is v1, each subsequent element is calculated as min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d) up to the second last element, and the last element is v2, i is t-1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `t-1`.
   - `speeds[0]` is initialized to `v1`.
   - `speeds[t-1]` is initialized to `v2`.
   - Each element `speeds[i]` for `1 ≤ i < t-1` is set to `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - **Changing Variables**: `speeds[i]` is updated in each iteration based on the previous value and the formula provided.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop updates `speeds[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `t-2`.
   - The update rule ensures that `speeds[i]` is the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` or the maximum possible speed considering the remaining distance to `v2`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop, `speeds` will have the following structure:
     - `speeds[0]` is `v1`.
     - `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
     - `speeds[2]` is `min(speeds[1] + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`.
     - This pattern continues until `speeds[t-2]` is `min(speeds[t-3] + d, v2 + 1 * d)`.
     - `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`.

Thus, the final state of the loop is as described in the output state.
