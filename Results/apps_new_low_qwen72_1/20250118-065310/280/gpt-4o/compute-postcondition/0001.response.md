To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100)
- `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100)
- `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10)
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where:
  - The first element is `v1`
  - The last element is `v2`
  - All other elements are 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the range defined by `t`.
2. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if `range(1, t)` is not empty. This means `t` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1`.

### Required Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `i` starts at 1.

### State Before the Loop Executes:
- `v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100)
- `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100)
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10)
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where:
  - The first element is `v1`
  - The last element is `v2`
  - All other elements are 0
- `i` is 1

### Final State:
State: **`v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1**
