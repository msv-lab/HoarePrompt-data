Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical issue that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the speeds at each second might not ensure that the final speed `v2` is reached exactly at the end of the `t` seconds while also adhering to the constraint that the speed can change by at most `d` meters per second.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following input:
- `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 10`
- `t = 5`, `d = 2`

The expected sequence of speeds should be something like:
- 5, 7, 9, 10, 10

However, the provided code might produce a different sequence due to the way it calculates the speeds. Specifically, the line:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```
This line ensures that the speed does not exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, which is not necessary and can lead to suboptimal sequences.

### Example:
For the input:
- `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 10`
- `t = 5`, `d = 2`

The expected output should be:
- Total distance: 5 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 10 = 41 meters

However, the provided code might produce a different sequence, leading to an incorrect total distance.

To fix this, the algorithm should ensure that the speed increases or decreases in such a way that the final speed `v2` is reached exactly at the end of the `t` seconds while adhering to the speed change constraint `d`. A more robust approach would involve calculating the optimal speed changes step-by-step to ensure the constraints are met.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
