You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.

- Program: 
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())

t, d = map(int, input().split())

speeds = [0] * t

speeds[0] = v1

speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: v1 is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), v2 is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), t is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), d is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), speeds is a list of length t where the first element is v1, each subsequent element is calculated as min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d) up to the second last element, and the last element is v2, i is t-1.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)

print(total_distance)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided solution aims to calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment under the constraints of changing speed by no more than `d` meters per second. The algorithm initializes an array `speeds` with the initial speed `v1` and the final speed `v2`. It then iterates through the remaining seconds, calculating the maximum possible speed for each second, considering the constraint on the speed change `d`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `speeds[0]` is set to `v1`, the initial speed.
   - `speeds[-1]` is set to `v2`, the final speed.

2. **Speed Calculation**:
   - For each second `i` from 1 to `t-1`, the speed is calculated as the minimum of:
     - The previous second's speed plus `d` (to ensure the speed does not increase by more than `d`).
     - The final speed `v2` plus the remaining time multiplied by `d` (to ensure the speed does not exceed the required final speed).

3. **Total Distance Calculation**:
   - The total distance is the sum of all speeds in the `speeds` array.

This approach ensures that:
- The speed changes do not exceed `d` meters per second.
- The initial and final speeds are respected.
- The total distance is maximized by always choosing the highest possible speed within the constraints.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible length of the path segment.
