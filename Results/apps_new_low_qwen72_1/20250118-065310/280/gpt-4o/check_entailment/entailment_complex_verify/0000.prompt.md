You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.

- Program: 
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())

t, d = map(int, input().split())

speeds = [0] * t

speeds[0] = v1

speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: v1 is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), v2 is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), t is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), d is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), speeds is a list of length t where the first element is v1, each subsequent element is calculated as min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d) up to the second last element, and the last element is v2, i is t-1.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)

print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two sets of integers from the user input: `v1` and `v2` (1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100), and `t` and `d` (2 ≤ t ≤ 100, 0 ≤ d ≤ 10). It initializes a list `speeds` of length `t` with all elements set to 0. The first element of `speeds` is set to `v1`, and the last element is set to `v2`. For each index `i` from 1 to `t-1`, the `i`-th element of `speeds` is updated to the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` or `v2` plus the remaining steps multiplied by `d`. Finally, the function calculates the total distance traveled by summing all elements in the `speeds` list and prints this total distance. The function does not return any value; it only prints the total distance. The function does not handle any edge cases mentioned in the annotations (e.g., "Equal speeds", "Short duration", "Long distance").


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical issue that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the speeds at each second might not ensure that the final speed `v2` is reached exactly at the end of the `t` seconds while also adhering to the constraint that the speed can change by at most `d` meters per second.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following input:
- `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 10`
- `t = 5`, `d = 2`

The expected sequence of speeds should be something like:
- 5, 7, 9, 10, 10

However, the provided code might produce a different sequence due to the way it calculates the speeds. Specifically, the line:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```
This line ensures that the speed does not exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, which is not necessary and can lead to suboptimal sequences.

### Example:
For the input:
- `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 10`
- `t = 5`, `d = 2`

The expected output should be:
- Total distance: 5 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 10 = 41 meters

However, the provided code might produce a different sequence, leading to an incorrect total distance.

To fix this, the algorithm should ensure that the speed increases or decreases in such a way that the final speed `v2` is reached exactly at the end of the `t` seconds while adhering to the speed change constraint `d`. A more robust approach would involve calculating the optimal speed changes step-by-step to ensure the constraints are met.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
