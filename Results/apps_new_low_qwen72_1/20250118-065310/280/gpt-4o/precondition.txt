v_1 and v_2 are integers where 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100; t is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; d is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 10. Additionally, there exists a sequence of speeds such that the speed at the first second is v_1, the speed at the last second is v_2, and the absolute difference in speed between any two consecutive seconds does not exceed d.
