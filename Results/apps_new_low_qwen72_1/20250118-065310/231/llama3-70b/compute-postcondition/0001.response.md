To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the components:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `len`, `N`, and the range expression `range(1, N // 2 + 1)`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, N // 2 + 1)` contains at least one value. This means that the starting value (1) must be less than or equal to the ending value (`N // 2`).

3. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 5000\).
   - `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - `max_len` is 0.

4. **Range Calculation**:
   - The range starts at 1 and ends at `N // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `N // 2` must be at least 1.

5. **Condition for `N // 2`**:
   - `N // 2` is at least 1 when `N` is at least 2.
   - Given that `N` is at least 2, `N // 2` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

6. **Initial Values**:
   - `len` will be 1 at the start of the first iteration.
   - `N` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - `S` is a string of length `N`.
   - `max_len` remains 0.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop will execute the first time, is:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0, `len` is 1**
