To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 5000\).
- `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `len` is 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `substr` is the substring `S[1:4]`.
- If `S.count(substr) > 1` and `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`, then `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 3. Otherwise, the values of `N`, `S`, `len`, `i`, `max_len`, and `substr` remain unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(N - len):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `N - len`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 5000\), and `len` is 3.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it's a `for` loop).

### Adjustments:
- **`i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be 2.
- **`N` and `len`**: These values remain unchanged because they are not modified in the loop head.

### Final State:
- `N` remains the same.
- `S` remains the same.
- `len` remains the same.
- `i` is now 2.
- `substr` remains the same (it is not part of the loop head and thus not adjusted).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 2, `substr` is the substring `S[1:4]`, `max_len` remains unchanged if the conditions were not met, or it is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 3 if the conditions were met.**
