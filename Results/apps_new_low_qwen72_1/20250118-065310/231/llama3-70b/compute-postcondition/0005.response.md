The code snippet `max_len = max(max_len, len)` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `len`.

- Initial values:
  - `max_len` is 0
  - `len` is 1

- Calculation:
  - `max(max_len, len)` evaluates to `max(0, 1)`, which results in 1.
  - Therefore, `max_len` is updated to 1.

The rest of the variables (`N`, `S`, `i`, `substr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 1, `len` is 1, `i` is 0, `substr` is `S[0]`. The substring `substr` appears more than once in `S`, and the index of the next occurrence of `substr` starting from `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `i + len`.**
