The code `max_len = max(max_len, len)` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `len`. Given that `len` is 3, `max_len` will be updated to 3 if it was less than 3, or remain unchanged if it was already 3 or greater.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 2, `substr` is the substring `S[2:5]`, `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 3.**
