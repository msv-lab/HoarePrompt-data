The code snippet updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `len`. Given that `len` is 2, the new value of `max_len` will be the maximum of its original value and 2. If `max_len` was already greater than or equal to 2, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is set to 2. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 2`, `substr` is the last two characters of `S`, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and 2**.
