The code snippet `substr = S[i:i + len]` creates a substring `substr` from the string `S`, starting at index `i` and ending at `i + len` (not inclusive). Given the initial state:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence
- `len` is 2
- `i` is `N - 1`

Since `i` is `N - 1` and `len` is 2, the slice `S[i:i + len]` will attempt to extract a substring of length 2 starting from the second-to-last character of `S`. However, because `i + len` would exceed the length of `S`, the actual length of the substring `substr` will be 1, containing only the last character of `S`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 1`, `substr` is the last character of `S`**.
