To determine the conditions under which the loop will execute the first time, we need to analyze the state of the objects involved in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(N - len):
```

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **`N`**: This is the length of the string `S`, and it is given that 2 <= N <= 5000.
2. **`len`**: This is set to 3.
3. **`i`**: This is the loop variable, and it starts at 0.

For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(N - len)` must contain at least one element. This means that `N - len` must be greater than 0.

Let's break it down step by step:

- The loop will execute if `N - len > 0`.
- Substituting `len` with 3, we get `N - 3 > 0`.
- Simplifying this, we get `N > 3`.

Given that `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, the condition `N > 3` must hold true for the loop to execute at least once.

Additionally, the initial state of `i` is 0, and `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence. However, `max_len` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so it remains as given.

Therefore, the state that must hold true for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 0, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence. If no such substring exists, `max_len` remains unchanged from its initial value, and `N` must be greater than 3.**
