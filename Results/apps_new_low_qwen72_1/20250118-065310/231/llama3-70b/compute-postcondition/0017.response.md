To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will start executing.

Given:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000.
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence.
- `len` is 2.
- `i` is `N - 1`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(N - len):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(N - len)` is not empty. This means that `N - len` must be greater than 0.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is `N - 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop condition itself. The loop will start with `i = 0` and iterate up to `N - len - 1`.
3. **Range Calculation**: For the loop to execute at least once, `N - len` must be greater than 0. Given that `len` is 2, this simplifies to `N - 2 > 0`, which further simplifies to `N > 2`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `N` must be greater than 2. The other variables (`S`, `max_len`, and `i`) do not directly affect the loop condition, but they are part of the initial state.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 1`**
