The code snippet updates the value of `substr` to the substring of `S` starting from index `i` and of length `len`. Given the initial state, let's evaluate the new state:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 (unchanged).
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters (unchanged).
- `max_len` is 0 or 1 (unchanged).
- `len` is 1 (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `substr` was initially `S[1]` (unchanged before the code runs).

After executing the code:
- `substr` is now updated to `S[2:3]`, which is the character at index 2 of `S`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0 or 1, `len` is 1, `i` is 2, `substr` is `S[2]`.**
