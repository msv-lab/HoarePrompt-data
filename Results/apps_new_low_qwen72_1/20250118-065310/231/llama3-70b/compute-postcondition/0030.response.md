Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 2, `i` is 0, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence. If no such substring exists, `max_len` remains unchanged from its initial value. The loop executes `N - 2` times if `N > 2`, and does not execute if `N <= 2`.**
