The code `max_len = max(max_len, len)` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `len`. Given the initial state:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `len` is 2
- `i` is `N - 2`
- `substr` is the last two characters of `S`

Since `len` is 2, the value of `max_len` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and 2. If `max_len` was already greater than or equal to 2, it remains unchanged. If `max_len` was less than 2, it will be updated to 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 2`, `substr` is the last two characters of `S`, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and 2.**
