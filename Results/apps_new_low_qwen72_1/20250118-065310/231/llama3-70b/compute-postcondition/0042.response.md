The code snippet updates the value of `substr` by assigning it the substring of `S` starting from index `i` (which is 2) and spanning the next `len` (which is 3) characters.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `len` is 3
- `i` is 2
- `substr` is the substring `S[1:4]`
- `max_len` remains unchanged if the conditions were not met, or it is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 3 if the conditions were met

After executing the code:
- `substr` is now the substring `S[2:5]`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `len` is 3
- `i` is 2
- `substr` is the substring `S[2:5]`
- `max_len` remains unchanged if the conditions were not met, or it is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 3 if the conditions were met

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 2, `substr` is the substring `S[2:5]`, `max_len` remains unchanged if the conditions were not met, or it is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 3 if the conditions were met.**
