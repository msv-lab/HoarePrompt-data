Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 1`, `substr` is the last character of `S`. If `substr` appears more than once in `S` and the second occurrence of `substr` starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, then `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 2. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.***
