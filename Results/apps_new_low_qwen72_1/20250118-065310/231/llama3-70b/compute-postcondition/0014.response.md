Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is 2, `substr` is `S[2]`. If `S.count(substr) > 1` and `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`, then `max_len` is 1 and `len` is 1. Otherwise, `max_len` remains 0 or 1 and `len` remains 1.***
