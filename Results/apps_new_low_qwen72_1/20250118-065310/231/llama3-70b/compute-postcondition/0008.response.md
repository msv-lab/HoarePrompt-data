The value of `substr` is updated to the substring of `S` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + len - 1`. Given that `i` is 1 and `len` is 1, `substr` will be the character at index 1 of the string `S`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0 or 1, `len` is 1, `i` is 1, `substr` is `S[1]`**
