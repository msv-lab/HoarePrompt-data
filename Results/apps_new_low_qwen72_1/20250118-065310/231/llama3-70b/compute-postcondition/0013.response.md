The value of `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0 or 1) and the value of `len` (which is 1). Since `len` is 1, `max_len` will be set to 1 if it was 0, or remain 1 if it was already 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 1, `len` is 1, `i` is 2, `substr` is `S[2]`.
