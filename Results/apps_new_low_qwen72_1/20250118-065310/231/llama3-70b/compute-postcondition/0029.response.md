Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 2`, `substr` is the last two characters of `S`. If `S.count(substr) > 1` and `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`, then `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and 2. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.***
