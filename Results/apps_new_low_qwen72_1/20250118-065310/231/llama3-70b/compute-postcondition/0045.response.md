Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is N - 3, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 3 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence. If no such substring exists, `max_len` remains unchanged from its initial value. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = N - 4`, checking each substring of length 3 for repeated occurrences that meet the specified conditions.**
