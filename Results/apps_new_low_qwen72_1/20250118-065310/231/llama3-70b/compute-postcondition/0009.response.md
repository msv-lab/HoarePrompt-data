The code snippet `max_len = max(max_len, len)` updates the value of `max_len` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `len`. Given the initial state:

- `max_len` is 0 or 1
- `len` is 1

If `max_len` is 0, then `max_len` will be updated to 1 (since 1 is greater than 0). If `max_len` is already 1, it remains 1 because 1 is not greater than 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 1, `len` is 1, `i` is 1, `substr` is `S[1]`**
