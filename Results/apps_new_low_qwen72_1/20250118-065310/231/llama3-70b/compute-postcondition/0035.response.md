The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `len`, which is 3. Since `len` is 3, if `max_len` was less than 3, it will now be set to 3. If `max_len` was already 3 or greater, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 0, `max_len` is the maximum of the previous `max_len` and 3, `substr` is the first 3 characters of `S`. The substring `substr` appears more than once in `S`, and the index of the second occurrence of `substr` in `S` is greater than or equal to `i + len` (which is 3).
