The only variables in the loop head are `len` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `len` and `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `len` is less than `N // 2 + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `len` is 2, and `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000. For the loop to execute one more time, `len` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `N` must still satisfy the condition that `len < N // 2 + 1`.

Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 5000, the condition `N // 2 + 1` will always be greater than 3 (since even the smallest possible `N`, which is 2, would result in `N // 2 + 1 = 2` and larger `N` values will result in a higher threshold). Therefore, the loop will execute again as long as `len` is incremented to 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 0, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence. If no such substring exists, `max_len` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
