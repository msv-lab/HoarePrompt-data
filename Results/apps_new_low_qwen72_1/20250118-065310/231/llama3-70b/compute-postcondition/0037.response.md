The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `N`, and `len`, so we can only adjust these. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N - len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, and `len` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and `N - len` must still be greater than `i`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, `substr` is the first 3 characters of `S`. If `S.count(substr) > 1` and the index of the second occurrence of `substr` in `S` is greater than or equal to 3, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of the previous `max_len` and 3.**
