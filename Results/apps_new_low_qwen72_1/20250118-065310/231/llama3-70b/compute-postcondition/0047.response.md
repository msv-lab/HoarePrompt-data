The code snippet `print(max_len)` outputs the value of `max_len`. This value is the maximum length of any substring that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence. Since the loop has already executed all its iterations, `max_len` has been determined and will not change. The variables `N`, `S`, `len`, and `i` remain as they were before the execution of this print statement.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, max_len is the maximum length of any substring that appears more than once in S and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, len is N // 2, i is N - len, and max_len has been printed.**
