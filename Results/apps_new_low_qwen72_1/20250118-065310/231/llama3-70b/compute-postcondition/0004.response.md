Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0, `len` is 1, `i` is 0, `substr` is `S[0]`. The substring `substr` appears more than once in `S`, and the index of the next occurrence of `substr` starting from `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `i + len`.***
