Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, max_len is the maximum length of any substring that appears more than once in S and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, len is N // 2, i is N - len. The loop has executed all its iterations, and max_len reflects the largest valid repeating substring length found, or remains 0 if no such substring exists. Variables `N` and `S` remain constant throughout the loop. The loop executes from `len = 1` to `len = N // 2`, and for each `len`, it iterates from `i = 0` to `i = N - len - 1`, checking each substring of length `len` for repeated occurrences that meet the specified conditions.**
