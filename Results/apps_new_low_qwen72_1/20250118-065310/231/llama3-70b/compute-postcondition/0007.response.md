The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `N`, and `len`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `N`, and `len`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `max_len` is 0 or 1
- `len` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `substr` is `S[0]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it's a for loop), and the condition `i < N - len` must still hold true. Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the last iteration, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. Since `len` is 1, the condition becomes `1 < N - 1`, which simplifies to `1 < N - 1` or `1 < N - 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1, and `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0 or 1, `len` is 1, `i` is 1, `substr` is `S[0]`**
