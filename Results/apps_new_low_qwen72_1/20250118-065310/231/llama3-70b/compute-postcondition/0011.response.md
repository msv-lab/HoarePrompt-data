To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `N`, and `len`.

### Given State:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000.
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `max_len` is 0 or 1.
- `len` is 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `substr` is `S[1]`.
- If `S.count(substr) > 1` and `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`, then `max_len` is 1. Otherwise, `max_len` remains 0 or 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(N - len):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `N - len`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
4. **Loop Continuation Condition**: The loop will continue if `i < N - len`. Since `len` is 1, the condition becomes `i < N - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be 2.
- `N` remains the same (2 <= N <= 5000).
- `len` remains 1.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0 or 1, `len` is 1, `i` is 2, `substr` is `S[1]`. If `S.count(substr) > 1` and `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`, then `max_len` is 1. Otherwise, `max_len` remains 0 or 1.**
