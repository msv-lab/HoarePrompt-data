To determine the conditions necessary for the loop to execute its first iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the initial state of the variables involved.

Given:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `max_len` is 0
- `len` is 1

Loop head:
```
for i in range(N - len):
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop will execute if the range function generates a sequence of numbers. The range function `range(start, stop)` generates numbers from `start` (inclusive) to `stop` (exclusive).
2. In this case, the loop head is `range(N - len)`, which means the loop will generate numbers from 0 to `N - len - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, the upper bound of the range must be greater than or equal to the lower bound. Therefore, `N - len` must be greater than 0.
4. Given that `len` is 1, the condition simplifies to `N - 1 > 0`, which further simplifies to `N > 1`.

Since `N` is already given to be between 2 and 5000, the condition `N > 1` is always satisfied. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once under the given constraints.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0, `len` is 1, `i` is 0**
