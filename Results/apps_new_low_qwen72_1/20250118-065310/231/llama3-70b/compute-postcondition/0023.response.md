The code `substr = S[i:i + len]` updates the value of `substr` to be the substring of `S` starting at index `i` and having a length of `len`. Given the initial state:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `len` is 2
- `i` is `N - 2`
- `substr` is the last character of `S`

The new value of `substr` is `S[N-2:N]`, which is the last two characters of `S`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 2`, `substr` is the last two characters of `S`.**
