The code snippet `substr = S[i:i + len]` extracts a substring from `S` starting at index `i` and ending at `i + len` (exclusive). Given the initial state:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `max_len` is 0
- `len` is 1
- `i` is 0

The substring `substr` will be the first character of `S` because `i` is 0 and `len` is 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0, `len` is 1, `i` is 0, `substr` is `S[0]`**
