The only variables in the loop head are `len` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len` relative to `N // 2 + 1`. If `len` is less than `N // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len` is 1 and `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000. For the loop to execute one more time, `len` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `N` must still be such that `len` is less than `N // 2 + 1`.

Given that `N` is at least 2, `N // 2 + 1` will be at least 2, allowing the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 1`**
