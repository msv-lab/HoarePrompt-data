Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 1, `substr` is the substring `S[1:4]`. If `S.count(substr) > 1` and `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`, then `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 3. Otherwise, the values of `N`, `S`, `len`, `i`, `max_len`, and `substr` remain unchanged.***
