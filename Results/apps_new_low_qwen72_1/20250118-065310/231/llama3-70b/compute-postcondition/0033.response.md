The code snippet assigns the substring of `S` starting from index `i` and of length `len` to the variable `substr`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, `len` is 3, and `S` is a string of length `N` (where 2 <= N <= 5000). Therefore, `substr` will be the first 3 characters of the string `S`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 0, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, `substr` is the first 3 characters of `S`.**
