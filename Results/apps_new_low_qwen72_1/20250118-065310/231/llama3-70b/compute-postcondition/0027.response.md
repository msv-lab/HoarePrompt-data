The code snippet updates the value of `substr` by slicing the string `S` from index `i` to `i + len`. Given that `i` is `N - 2` and `len` is 2, this means `substr` will be set to the last two characters of `S`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 2`, `substr` is the last two characters of `S`, `max_len` is updated or remains unchanged based on the conditions in the loop body.**
