The provided code snippet reads two inputs: an integer `N` and a string `S`. It then initializes a variable `max_len` to 0. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer within the range 2 to 5000, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of lowercase English letters. After executing the code, the values of `N` and `S` remain unchanged, but `max_len` is set to 0.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, max_len is 0**
