The code `max_len = max(max_len, len)` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `len`. Given the initial state:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `len` is 3
- `i` is 1
- `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence
- `substr` is the substring `S[1:4]`

We need to determine the new value of `max_len`. Since `len` is 3, and `max_len` is initially the maximum length of any substring of length 2, the new value of `max_len` will be the maximum between the current `max_len` and 3.

If the current `max_len` is less than 3, `max_len` will be updated to 3. If `max_len` is already 3 or greater, `max_len` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 3, `substr` is the substring `S[1:4]`**.
