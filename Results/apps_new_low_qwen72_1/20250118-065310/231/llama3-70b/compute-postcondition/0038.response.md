The code snippet updates the value of `substr` by slicing the string `S` from index `i` to `i + len`. Given the initial state:

- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters
- `len` is 3
- `i` is 1
- `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence
- `substr` is the first 3 characters of `S`

The new value of `substr` is `S[1:4]`, which means it now contains the substring starting from the second character to the fourth character of `S`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, `substr` is the substring `S[1:4]`.**
