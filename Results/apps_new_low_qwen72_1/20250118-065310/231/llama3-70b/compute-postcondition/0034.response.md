Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `len` is 3, `i` is 0, `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring of length 2 that appears more than once in `S` and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence, `substr` is the first 3 characters of `S`. The substring `substr` appears more than once in `S`, and the index of the second occurrence of `substr` in `S` is greater than or equal to `i + len` (which is 3).***
