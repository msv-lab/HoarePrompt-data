Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 0 or 1, `len` is 1, `i` is 0, `substr` is `S[0]`. If `S.count(substr) > 1` and the index of the next occurrence of `substr` starting from `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `i + len`, then `max_len` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `max_len` remains 0.***
