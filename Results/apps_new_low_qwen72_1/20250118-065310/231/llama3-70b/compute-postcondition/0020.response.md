The value of `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `len`. Since `len` is 2, if `max_len` was less than 2, it will now be set to 2. If `max_len` was already 2 or greater, it remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 5000 and N > 2, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the maximum of the original `max_len` and 2, `len` is 2, `i` is `N - 1`, `substr` is the last character of `S`, `substr` appears more than once in `S`, and the second occurrence of `substr` starts at or after the end of the first occurrence.**
