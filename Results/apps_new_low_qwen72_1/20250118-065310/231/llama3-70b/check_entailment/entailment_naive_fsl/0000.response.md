Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it checks for non-overlapping occurrences of substrings. Specifically, the condition `if S.count(substr) > 1 and i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1):` is problematic. 

- The `S.count(substr) > 1` checks if the substring appears more than once in the string, but it does not guarantee that these occurrences are non-overlapping.
- The `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)` condition is intended to ensure that the second occurrence starts after the first one ends, but this condition is not always sufficient to guarantee non-overlapping.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aabbaa
```
The correct output should be `2` because the substring "aa" appears twice without overlapping. However, the program will incorrectly output `1` because it fails to correctly handle the non-overlapping condition.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check for non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings. A corrected version might look like this:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    S = input()
    max_len = 0
    for length in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
        for i in range(N - length):
            substr = S[i:i + length]
            for j in range(i + length, N - length + 1):
                if S[j:j + length] == substr:
                    max_len = max(max_len, length)
                    break
    print(max_len)
```

This version ensures that the second occurrence of the substring starts after the first one ends, thus guaranteeing non-overlapping.
