Reasoning:
The provided solution aims to find the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice in the given string `S` without overlapping. Let's break down the reasoning and verify the correctness step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is the length of the string `S`.
   - `max_len` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum length of the repeated substring found.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of substrings from 1 to `N // 2 + 1`. This is because a substring cannot be longer than half the length of the string if it is to appear twice without overlapping.

3. **Generate Substrings**:
   - For each possible length, the inner loop generates all substrings of that length starting from each position in the string.

4. **Check for Repeated Substrings**:
   - For each generated substring, it checks if the substring appears more than once in the string using `S.count(substr) > 1`.
   - It also ensures that the second occurrence of the substring does not overlap with the first by checking `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`.

5. **Update Maximum Length**:
   - If the conditions are met, it updates `max_len` to the maximum of the current `max_len` and the length of the substring.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the maximum length of the repeated substring found.

### Analysis of the Condition `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`
The condition `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)` is indeed necessary. Here's why:
- `S.index(substr, i + 1)` finds the index of the next occurrence of `substr` starting from `i + 1`.
- The condition `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)` ensures that the second occurrence of the substring starts after the end of the first occurrence, thus avoiding overlap.

### Correctness of the Code
- The outer loop runs from 1 to `N // 2 + 1`, which is correct because a substring of length greater than `N // 2` cannot appear twice without overlapping.
- The inner loop generates all possible substrings of the current length.
- The condition `S.count(substr) > 1` ensures that the substring appears more than once.
- The condition `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)` ensures that the second occurrence does not overlap with the first.

### Edge Cases
- If `S` is a string without any repeating substrings, the code correctly prints `0`.
- If `S` contains multiple substrings that meet the criteria, the code correctly prints the length of the longest one.

### Conclusion
The original code is correct and meets the problem requirements. The condition `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)` is necessary and should not be removed.

Final: **True**
