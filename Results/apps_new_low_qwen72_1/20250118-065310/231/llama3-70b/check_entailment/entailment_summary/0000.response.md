Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice in the input string `S` without overlapping. Here's how the logic works:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the length `N` and the string `S` from the input. It initializes `max_len` to 0, which will store the length of the longest repeated substring found.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Substring Lengths**: The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of substrings from 1 up to `N // 2 + 1`. This is because a repeated substring cannot be longer than half the length of the string (to avoid overlapping).

3. **Finding Substrings**: For each length, the inner loop iterates over the possible starting positions `i` of the substring within `S`. It extracts the substring `substr` from position `i` to `i + len`.

4. **Checking for Repeated Non-Overlapping Occurrences**: The program checks if the substring `substr` appears more than once in `S` using `S.count(substr) > 1`. Additionally, it ensures that the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence using `i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1)`.

5. **Updating Maximum Length**: If the conditions are met, the program updates `max_len` with the current length if it is greater than the previously recorded maximum length.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the maximum length found. If no such substring exists, `max_len` remains 0, and 0 is printed.

The logic is sound and correctly implements the requirements of the problem. The constraints are respected, and the edge cases (like no repeating substrings) are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
