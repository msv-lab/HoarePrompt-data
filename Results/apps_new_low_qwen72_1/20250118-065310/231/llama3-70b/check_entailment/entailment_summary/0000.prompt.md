Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Given is a string S of length N.
Find the maximum length of a non-empty string that occurs twice or more in S as contiguous substrings without overlapping.
More formally, find the maximum positive integer len such that there exist integers l_1 and l_2 ( 1 \leq l_1, l_2 \leq N - len + 1 ) that satisfy the following:
 - l_1 + len \leq l_2
 - S[l_1+i] = S[l_2+i] (i = 0, 1, ..., len - 1)
If there is no such integer len, print 0.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 5 \times 10^3
 - |S| = N
 - S consists of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

-----Output-----
Print the maximum length of a non-empty string that occurs twice or more in S as contiguous substrings without overlapping. If there is no such non-empty string, print 0 instead.

-----Sample Input-----
5
ababa

-----Sample Output-----
2

The strings satisfying the conditions are: a, b, ab, and ba. The maximum length among them is 2, which is the answer.
Note that aba occurs twice in S as contiguous substrings, but there is no pair of integers l_1 and l_2 mentioned in the statement such that l_1 + len \leq l_2.

# Program:
def func():
    N = int(input())
    S = input()
    max_len = 0
    for len in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
        for i in range(N - len):
            substr = S[i:i + len]
            if S.count(substr) > 1 and i + len <= S.index(substr, i + 1):
                max_len = max(max_len, len)
    print(max_len)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from the standard input, where `N` is the length of `S` and both `N` and `S` meet the constraints provided. It then finds the maximum length of any substring within `S` that appears more than once and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence. The function prints this maximum length to the standard output. If no such repeating substring exists, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed maximum length, and the original values of `N` and `S` remain unchanged. Edge cases include when `S` is a string without any repeating substrings, in which case `0` is printed, and when `S` contains multiple substrings that meet the criteria, in which case the length of the longest one is printed.
