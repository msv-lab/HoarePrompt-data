The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from the standard input, where `N` is the length of `S` and both `N` and `S` meet the constraints provided. It then finds the maximum length of any substring within `S` that appears more than once and where the second occurrence starts at or after the end of the first occurrence. The function prints this maximum length to the standard output. If no such repeating substring exists, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed maximum length, and the original values of `N` and `S` remain unchanged. Edge cases include when `S` is a string without any repeating substrings, in which case `0` is printed, and when `S` contains multiple substrings that meet the criteria, in which case the length of the longest one is printed.
