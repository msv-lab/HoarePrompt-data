Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the case when `c0` and `c1` are different. Specifically, the program always uses the minimum of `c0` and `c1` to calculate the cost, but this approach is not optimal in all scenarios.

Consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 5`, `c0 = 1`, `c1 = 10`.

According to the problem, we need to minimize the total cost. The optimal encoding for this case should be:
- "00", "01", "100", "101", "110".

Here, the total cost is:
- 2 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 3 * 1 = 14.

However, the provided program will output:
- `ans = 1 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 2 * 1 = 5`.

This is because the program only considers the minimum cost (`c0` in this case) and does not account for the fact that using more expensive bits (`c1` in this case) might be necessary to avoid prefix conflicts.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
