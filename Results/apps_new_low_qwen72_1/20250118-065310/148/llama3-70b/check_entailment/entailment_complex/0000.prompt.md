Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
R3D3 spent some time on an internship in MDCS. After earning enough money, he decided to go on a holiday somewhere far, far away. He enjoyed suntanning, drinking alcohol-free cocktails and going to concerts of popular local bands. While listening to "The White Buttons" and their hit song "Dacan the Baker", he met another robot for whom he was sure is the love of his life. Well, his summer, at least. Anyway, R3D3 was too shy to approach his potential soulmate, so he decided to write her a love letter. However, he stumbled upon a problem. Due to a terrorist threat, the Intergalactic Space Police was monitoring all letters sent in the area. Thus, R3D3 decided to invent his own alphabet, for which he was sure his love would be able to decipher.

There are n letters in R3D3’s alphabet, and he wants to represent each letter as a sequence of '0' and '1', so that no letter’s sequence is a prefix of another letter's sequence. Since the Intergalactic Space Communications Service has lately introduced a tax for invented alphabets, R3D3 must pay a certain amount of money for each bit in his alphabet’s code (check the sample test for clarifications). He is too lovestruck to think clearly, so he asked you for help.

Given the costs c_0 and c_1 for each '0' and '1' in R3D3’s alphabet, respectively, you should come up with a coding for the alphabet (with properties as above) with minimum total cost.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains three integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), c_0 and c_1 (0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 10^8) — the number of letters in the alphabet, and costs of '0' and '1', respectively. 


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — minimum possible total a cost of the whole alphabet.


-----Example-----
Input
4 1 2

Output
12



-----Note-----

There are 4 letters in the alphabet. The optimal encoding is "00", "01", "10", "11". There are 4 zeroes and 4 ones used, so the total cost is 4·1 + 4·2 = 12.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, c_0 and c_1 are integers such that 0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 10^8.
def func():
    n, c0, c1 = map(int, input().split())

ans = 0

i = 0
    while 1 << i < n:
        ans += (1 << i) * min(c0, c1)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is an integer from input and must be greater than 1, c0 is an integer from input, c1 is an integer from input, ans is (2^k - 1) * min(c0, c1) where k is the largest integer such that 2^k < n, i is k.
    if (1 << i > n) :
        ans += (n - (1 << i - 1)) * min(c0, c1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `c0` and `c1` are integers from input, `i` is `k` which is the largest integer such that `2^k < n`. If `1 << i` (which is `2^i`) is greater than `n`, `ans` is `(2^k - 1) * min(c0, c1) + (n - (1 << i - 1)) * min(c0, c1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `(2^k - 1) * min(c0, c1)`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `c0`, and `c1` from the input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8` and `0 ≤ c0, c1 ≤ 10^8`. It calculates the sum of the series `(2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(k-1)) * min(c0, c1)` plus the remaining part `(n - 2^k) * min(c0, c1)` if `2^k < n`, where `k` is the largest integer such that `2^k < n`. The final result, `ans`, is printed to the console. The function does not return any value. The state after the function execution is that `ans` holds the calculated value, and the input values `n`, `c0`, and `c1` remain unchanged. Edge cases include when `n` is a power of 2, in which case the loop will still execute correctly, and the final addition will be zero.
