Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum cost for encoding an alphabet of size \( n \) using two symbols ('0' and '1') with given costs \( c_0 \) and \( c_1 \). The key requirement is that no encoded sequence should be a prefix of another. This problem can be approached using a binary tree structure where each node represents a symbol ('0' or '1') and the leaves represent the encoded letters.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function reads the input values \( n \), \( c_0 \), and \( c_1 \).
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It initializes `i` to 0, which will be used to count the levels of the binary tree.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs while \( 2^i < n \). This ensures that we cover all levels of the binary tree up to the point where the number of nodes (leaves) is just less than \( n \).
   - In each iteration, it adds the cost of the current level to `ans`. The cost is calculated as \( (2^i) \times \min(c_0, c_1) \), which means the cost of all nodes at the current level is added.
   - It increments `i` to move to the next level.

3. **Handling the Remaining Nodes**:
   - After the loop, `i` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^i \geq n \).
   - If \( 2^i > n \), it means there are some extra nodes in the last level that need to be accounted for. The program adds the cost of these remaining nodes to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost by ensuring that no sequence is a prefix of another.
  - It uses the property of binary trees to ensure that the number of nodes at each level is \( 2^i \).
  - The cost calculation is done efficiently by using the minimum of \( c_0 \) and \( c_1 \).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where \( n \) is exactly a power of 2.
  - It also handles the case where \( n \) is not a power of 2 by adding the cost of the remaining nodes in the last level.

- **Input Constraints**:
  - The program respects the constraints \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^8 \) and \( 0 \leq c_0, c_1 \leq 10^8 \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
