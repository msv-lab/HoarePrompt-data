You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
R3D3 spent some time on an internship in MDCS. After earning enough money, he decided to go on a holiday somewhere far, far away. He enjoyed suntanning, drinking alcohol-free cocktails and going to concerts of popular local bands. While listening to "The White Buttons" and their hit song "Dacan the Baker", he met another robot for whom he was sure is the love of his life. Well, his summer, at least. Anyway, R3D3 was too shy to approach his potential soulmate, so he decided to write her a love letter. However, he stumbled upon a problem. Due to a terrorist threat, the Intergalactic Space Police was monitoring all letters sent in the area. Thus, R3D3 decided to invent his own alphabet, for which he was sure his love would be able to decipher.

There are n letters in R3D3’s alphabet, and he wants to represent each letter as a sequence of '0' and '1', so that no letter’s sequence is a prefix of another letter's sequence. Since the Intergalactic Space Communications Service has lately introduced a tax for invented alphabets, R3D3 must pay a certain amount of money for each bit in his alphabet’s code (check the sample test for clarifications). He is too lovestruck to think clearly, so he asked you for help.

Given the costs c_0 and c_1 for each '0' and '1' in R3D3’s alphabet, respectively, you should come up with a coding for the alphabet (with properties as above) with minimum total cost.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains three integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), c_0 and c_1 (0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 10^8) — the number of letters in the alphabet, and costs of '0' and '1', respectively. 


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — minimum possible total a cost of the whole alphabet.


-----Example-----
Input
4 1 2

Output
12



-----Note-----

There are 4 letters in the alphabet. The optimal encoding is "00", "01", "10", "11". There are 4 zeroes and 4 ones used, so the total cost is 4·1 + 4·2 = 12.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, c0, c1) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while 1 << i < n:
        ans += (1 << i) * min(c0, c1)
        i += 1
    if 1 << i > n:
        ans += (n - (1 << i - 1)) * min(c0, c1)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `c0`, and `c1` from the input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8` and `0 ≤ c0, c1 ≤ 10^8`. It calculates the sum of the series `(2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(k-1)) * min(c0, c1)` plus the remaining part `(n - 2^k) * min(c0, c1)` if `2^k < n`, where `k` is the largest integer such that `2^k < n`. The final result, `ans`, is printed to the console. The function does not return any value. The state after the function execution is that `ans` holds the calculated value, and the input values `n`, `c0`, and `c1` remain unchanged. Edge cases include when `n` is a power of 2, in which case the loop will still execute correctly, and the final addition will be zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum possible total cost for encoding an alphabet with `n` letters using sequences of '0' and '1', where the cost of each '0' is `c0` and the cost of each '1' is `c1`. The key constraints are that no sequence can be a prefix of another sequence, and the goal is to minimize the total cost.

The program uses a greedy approach to build the encoding:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `ans` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total cost.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current length of the binary sequences.

2. **Loop to Build Full Levels**:
   - The loop continues until the number of sequences (which is `1 << i` or \(2^i\)) is less than `n`.
   - For each level, it adds the cost of the sequences at that level to `ans`. The cost is calculated as the number of sequences at that level (`1 << i`) multiplied by the minimum of `c0` and `c1`.

3. **Handling Remaining Sequences**:
   - After exiting the loop, if the number of sequences at the next level (`1 << i`) exceeds `n`, it calculates the remaining sequences needed to reach `n` and adds their cost to `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The program correctly builds the encoding by ensuring that no sequence is a prefix of another. This is achieved by using full levels of binary sequences and then handling the remaining sequences.
  - The cost calculation is done by always choosing the cheaper bit ('0' or '1') to minimize the total cost.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `c0` and `c1` are equal by always choosing the minimum cost, which is correct.
  - It also correctly handles the case where `n` is a power of 2, as it will add the exact number of sequences needed without any extra cost.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The loop runs in logarithmic time relative to `n` (specifically, `O(log n)`), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required logic and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
