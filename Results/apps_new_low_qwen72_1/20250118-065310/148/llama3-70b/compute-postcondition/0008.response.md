Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from input and must be greater than 1, `c0` is an integer from input, `c1` is an integer from input, `ans` is `(2^k - 1) * min(c0, c1)` where `k` is the largest integer such that `2^k < n`, `i` is `k`. The current value of `i` is such that `1 << i` is greater than `n`.***
