The provided code snippet modifies the variables `ans` and `i` based on the initial values of `n`, `c0`, and `c1`. Here's the analysis and the final output state:

- The initial state is:
  - `n` is an integer from input and must be greater than 2.
  - `c0` is an integer from input.
  - `c1` is an integer from input.
  - `ans` is initialized to `min(c0, c1)`.
  - `i` is 1.

- The first line of the code:
  - `ans += (1 << i) * min(c0, c1)`
  - This line adds `(1 << i) * min(c0, c1)` to `ans`.
  - Since `i` is 1, `(1 << i)` equals 2.
  - Therefore, `ans` becomes `ans + 2 * min(c0, c1)`.

- The second line of the code:
  - `i += 1`
  - This line increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

Combining these changes, the final output state is:
- `n` remains an integer from input and must be greater than 2.
- `c0` remains an integer from input.
- `c1` remains an integer from input.
- `ans` is now `min(c0, c1) + 2 * min(c0, c1)`, which simplifies to `3 * min(c0, c1)`.
- `i` is now 2.

Output State: **n is an integer from input and must be greater than 2, c0 is an integer from input, c1 is an integer from input, ans is 3 * min(c0, c1), i is 2**
