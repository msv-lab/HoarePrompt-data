The provided code snippet updates the variables `ans` and `i` based on the initial values of `c0` and `c1`. Here's the analysis and the resulting final state:

- The first line updates `ans` by adding the value of `(1 << i) * min(c0, c1)` to it. Since `i` is initially 0, `(1 << 0)` equals 1. Therefore, `ans` becomes `ans + 1 * min(c0, c1)`, which simplifies to `ans + min(c0, c1)`.
- The second line increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **n is an integer from input and must be greater than 1, c0 is an integer from input, c1 is an integer from input, ans is min(c0, c1), i is 1**
