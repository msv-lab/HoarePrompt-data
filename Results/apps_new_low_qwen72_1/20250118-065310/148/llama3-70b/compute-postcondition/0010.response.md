Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `c0` and `c1` are integers from input, `i` is `k` which is the largest integer such that `2^k < n`. If `1 << i` (which is `2^i`) is greater than `n`, `ans` is `(2^k - 1) * min(c0, c1) + (n - (1 << i - 1)) * min(c0, c1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `(2^k - 1) * min(c0, c1)`.***
