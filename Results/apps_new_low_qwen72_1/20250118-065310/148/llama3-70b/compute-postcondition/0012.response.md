The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given (`n`, `c_0`, and `c_1`), it can be inferred that the function should accept these three parameters. The constraints indicate that `n` is an integer within the range [2, 10^8], and `c_0` and `c_1` are integers within the range [0, 10^8]. The output section is missing, so I cannot determine the specific return values or conditions. 

However, if we assume the function is supposed to return some value or values based on these inputs, the description would look like this:

The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `c_0`, and `c_1`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, and `c_0` and `c_1` are integers such that 0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 10^8. The function's return value is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `n`, `c_0`, and `c_1`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, and `c_0` and `c_1` are integers such that 0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 10^8. The return value is not specified.**
