The provided code snippet reads three integer values from the input, assigns them to `n`, `c0`, and `c1` respectively, initializes `ans` to 0, and sets `i` to 0. 

- `n`, `c0`, and `c1` are reassigned new values based on the input, which are within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 0 ≤ c0, c1 ≤ 10^8).
- `ans` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0.

No other variables are affected, and no further operations are performed in the given code snippet.

Output State: **n is an integer from input, c0 is an integer from input, c1 is an integer from input, ans is 0, i is 0**
