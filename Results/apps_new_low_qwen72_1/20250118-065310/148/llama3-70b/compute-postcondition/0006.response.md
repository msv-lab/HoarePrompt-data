The provided code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `(1 << i) * min(c0, c1)` to it, and then increments `i` by 1. Let's break down the final state after executing this code:

1. The initial value of `ans` is `3 * min(c0, c1)`.
2. The initial value of `i` is 2.
3. The expression `(1 << i)` shifts the binary representation of 1 left by `i` positions, which is equivalent to `2^i`. With `i` being 2, this evaluates to `4`.
4. The value of `min(c0, c1)` is calculated and used in the expression `(1 << i) * min(c0, c1)`, which simplifies to `4 * min(c0, c1)`.
5. This value is added to the current `ans`, so the new `ans` becomes `3 * min(c0, c1) + 4 * min(c0, c1)`, which simplifies to `7 * min(c0, c1)`.
6. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **n is an integer greater than 8, c0 is an integer, c1 is an integer, ans is 7 * min(c0, c1), i is 3**
