Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `c0`, and `c1` from the input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8` and `0 ≤ c0, c1 ≤ 10^8`. It calculates the sum of the series `(2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(k-1)) * min(c0, c1)` plus the remaining part `(n - 2^k) * min(c0, c1)` if `2^k < n`, where `k` is the largest integer such that `2^k < n`. The final result, `ans`, is printed to the console. The function does not return any value. The state after the function execution is that `ans` holds the calculated value, and the input values `n`, `c0`, and `c1` remain unchanged. Edge cases include when `n` is a power of 2, in which case the loop will still execute correctly, and the final addition will be zero. **
