The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `t`. Since `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and its length does not exceed 100 characters, `n` will be an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. The state of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters, `n` is the length of `t` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100)**
