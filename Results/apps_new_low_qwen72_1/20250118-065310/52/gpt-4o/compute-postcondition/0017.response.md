Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length between 3 and 100 inclusive, and `i` is 3. If the first 3 characters of `t` are the same as the last 3 characters of `t`, the program returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `s`, where `s` is `t` excluding its last 3 characters.***
