Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive. `i` is 2. If the first character of `t` is equal to the last character of `t`, then `s` is `t` without the last character, and `s` has `n - 1` characters. If `s + t[-i:]` is equal to `t`, the program returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `s`, which is `t` without the last 2 characters, and `s` has `n - 2` characters. Otherwise, no return occurs and `s` remains as `t` without the last character, with `n - 1` characters.***
