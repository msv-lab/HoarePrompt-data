The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters. The function evaluates the length of `t` and returns different outputs based on the length:

- **Case_1:** If the length of `t` allows for a string `s` that is `t` without its last character, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `s`, where `s` has `n - 1` characters, and `n` is the length of `t`.
- **Case_2:** If the length of `t` allows for a string `s` that is `t` without the last 2 characters, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `s`, where `s` has `n - 2` characters.
- **Case_3:** If the length of `t` allows for a string `s` that is `t` excluding its last 3 characters, and `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length between 3 and 100 inclusive, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `s`, where `s` has `n - 3` characters.
- **Case_4:** If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with a maximum length of 100. It returns 'YES\n' followed by a modified version of `t` (either `t` without the last 1, 2, or 3 characters) if the length of `t` meets specific conditions. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'NO'.**
