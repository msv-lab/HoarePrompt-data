To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop structure:

- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, where `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of the string `t`, which is between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Given this information, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

1. **Increment `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, `i` should be incremented from 1 to 2.
2. **Check `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the length of the string `t`, which does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive. `i` is 2. If the first character of `t` is equal to the last character of `t`, then `s` is `t` without the last character, `s` has `n - 1` characters, and `(s + t[-i:])` is not equal to `t`.**
