`s` is assigned the value of `t` without the last `i` characters. Since `i` is 2, `s` will contain all characters of `t` except the last two. The length of `s` will be `n - 2`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive. `i` is 2. If the first character of `t` is equal to the last character of `t`, then `s` is `t` without the last character, `s` has `n - 1` characters, and `(s + t[-i:])` is not equal to `t`. `s` is `t` without the last 2 characters, and `s` has `n - 2` characters.**
