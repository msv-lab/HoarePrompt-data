To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - This means `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n-1` (inclusive).

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `range(1, n)` must contain at least one value.
   - `range(1, n)` will contain values if `n > 1`.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters.
   - `n` is the length of `t` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Given `n` is the length of `t`, and `t` is non-empty, `n` must be at least 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters, `n` is the length of `t` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `i` is 1**
