The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `t` with its length `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (to 3), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (thus, `n` must be at least 3).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is between 3 and 100 inclusive. `i` is 3.**
