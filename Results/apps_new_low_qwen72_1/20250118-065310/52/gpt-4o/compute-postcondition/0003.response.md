The code `s = t[:-i]` creates a new variable `s` which is a substring of `t` excluding the last `i` characters. Given that `i` is 1, `s` will be `t` without the last character.

- `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters.
- `n` is the length of `t` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100).
- `i` is 1.
- The first character of `t` is equal to the last character of `t`.

Since `i` is 1, `s` will be `t` without the last character, which means `s` will have `n - 1` characters.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `i` is 1, the first character of `t` is equal to the last character of `t`, `s` is `t` without the last character, `s` has `n - 1` characters.**
