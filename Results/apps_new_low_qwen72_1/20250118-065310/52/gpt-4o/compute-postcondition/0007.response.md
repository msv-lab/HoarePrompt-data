Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive. `i` is 1. If the first character of `t` is equal to the last character of `t`, then `s` is `t` without the last character, `s` has `n - 1` characters, and `(s + t[-i:])` is not equal to `t`.***
