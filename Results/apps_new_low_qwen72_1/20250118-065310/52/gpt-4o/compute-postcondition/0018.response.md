Output State: **The string `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length `n` between 1 and 100 inclusive. The variable `i` iterates from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `s` is defined such that if the substring `t[:i]` equals the substring `t[-i:]`, then `s` is set to `t[:-i]`. If `s + t[-i:]` equals `t`, the program returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `s`. If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without returning anything. The variables that remain constant are `t` and `n`. After the loop, `i` will be `n` if the loop completes without returning.**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over the indices from 1 to `n-1`, checking if the prefix `t[:i]` is equal to the suffix `t[-i:]`. If they are equal, it sets `s` to `t[:-i]` and checks if concatenating `s` with `t[-i:]` equals `t`. If this condition is met, it returns 'YES\n' followed by `s`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` changes from 1 to `n-1`.
   - `s` is set if the prefix and suffix match and the concatenation condition is met.
   - `t` and `n` remain constant throughout the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop checks for the longest prefix that matches the suffix and can form the original string `t` when concatenated with the remaining part of the string.
   - If such a prefix is found, it returns immediately.
   - If no such prefix is found, the loop completes without any return.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The conditions for the loop to execute and the conditions for the return statement are consistent with the given output states after the first few iterations.
   - The final state of `i` is `n` if the loop completes without returning, indicating that no valid prefix was found.
