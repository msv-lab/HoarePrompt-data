`s` is assigned the value of `t` excluding the last `i` characters. Since `i` is 3, `s` will contain all characters of `t` except the last 3. The length of `t` (`n`) is between 3 and 100, so `s` will have a length of `n - 3`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is between 3 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 3, `s` is `t` excluding the last 3 characters**
