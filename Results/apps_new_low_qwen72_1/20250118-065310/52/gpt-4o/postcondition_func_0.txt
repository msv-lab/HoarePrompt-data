The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `t`, which is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a maximum length of 100. The function checks if the string `t` can be split into two parts such that the prefix and suffix of `t` (of the same length) are identical. If such a split is found, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring of `t` that excludes the matching suffix. The possible lengths of the matching suffix are 1, 2, or 3 characters. If no such split is found, the function returns 'NO'. The original string `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function.
