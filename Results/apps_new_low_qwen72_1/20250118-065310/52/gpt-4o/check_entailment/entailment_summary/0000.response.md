Reasoning:  
The provided solution attempts to find if the input string `t` can be formed by overlapping two identical substrings. It does this by iterating through possible overlaps from 1 up to the length of `t` minus 1. For each possible overlap, it checks if the prefix and suffix of the same length are equal. If they are, it constructs a new string `s` by removing the overlapping part from the end of `t`. It then checks if concatenating `s` with the overlapping part equals the original string `t`. If so, it returns 'YES' followed by the substring `s`.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic: the condition `if s + t[-i:] == t:` is redundant because the previous check `if t[:i] == t[-i:]` already ensures that `s + t[-i:]` will be equal to `t`. This means the function can be simplified by removing the redundant check.

Additionally, the problem specifies that the overlap must be a positive number less than the length of the message. The current implementation correctly handles this by iterating over all possible overlaps from 1 to `n-1`.

Given these points, the logic is fundamentally correct, even though it can be optimized.

Correctness: **True**
