Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the overlap is more than one character but less than the length of the message. For example, consider the input `t = "abcabcabc"`. According to the problem description, this could be a result of the error where two messages "abcabc" were sent, and they overlapped by three characters ("abc"), resulting in "abcabcabc". However, the program will incorrectly return "NO" because it only checks for overlaps of exactly one character. To be correct, the program should also check for overlaps greater than one character and ensure that the overlap is positive and less than the length of the message.
