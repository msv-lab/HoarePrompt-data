Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over all possible split points of the string `t` and checking if the prefix and suffix of `t` up to that point are equal. If they are, it checks if the rest of the string can be reconstructed by repeating this prefix/suffix. If so, it returns "YES" followed by the original message `s`. If no such split is found, it returns "NO".

However, there are a couple of issues with the logic:
1. The condition `if t[:i] == t[-i:]` checks if the prefix and suffix of length `i` are the same, which is correct.
2. The line `s = t[:-i]` constructs the candidate message `s` by removing the last `i` characters from `t`.
3. The check `if s + t[-i:] == t` is intended to verify if concatenating `s` with the suffix of `t` of length `i` reconstructs `t`. However, this check is not necessary because if `t[:i] == t[-i:]`, then `s + t[-i:]` will always equal `t`.

A more straightforward approach would be to directly check if `t[:i] == t[-i:]` and then return "YES" with the appropriate `s` if this condition holds.

Additionally, the program should ensure that the overlap is non-empty and less than the length of the message `s`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t):
    n = len(t)
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if t[:i] == t[-i:]:
            s = t[:-i]
            return 'YES\n' + s
    return 'NO'
```

Given the original program, it does not correctly handle the case where the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
