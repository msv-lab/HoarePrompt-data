### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Overview:
The program reads an input string `t` and passes it to the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` checks if the string `t` can be split into two parts such that the prefix and suffix of `t` (of the same length) are identical. If such a split is found, it returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring of `t` that excludes the matching suffix. If no such split is found, it returns 'NO'.

#### Function Summary:
- **Input:** A non-empty string `t` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a maximum length of 100.
- **Output:** 
  - 'YES\n' followed by the substring `s` if the string `t` can be split into two parts with a common prefix/suffix.
  - 'NO' if no such split is found.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (where `n` is the length of `t`).
   - For each `i`, it checks if the prefix `t[:i]` is equal to the suffix `t[-i:]`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `t[:i] == t[-i:]`, it forms the substring `s` by excluding the matching suffix: `s = t[:-i]`.
   - It then checks if `s + t[-i:]` equals `t`. This ensures that the substring `s` concatenated with the matching suffix indeed forms the original string `t`.

3. **Return Values:**
   - If the condition is met, it returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring `s`.
   - If no such `i` is found, it returns 'NO'.

#### Addressing the Original Assessment:
- **Overlap Handling:**
  - The original assessment mentions that the program does not handle overlaps greater than one character. However, the loop iterates over all possible prefix/suffix lengths from 1 to `n-1`, which means it does check for overlaps greater than one character.
  - For example, with the input `t = "abcabcabc"`, the program will correctly identify the overlap of "abc" (length 3) and return 'YES\nabcabc'.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases where the overlap is exactly one character, as well as cases where the overlap is greater than one character.
  - It also correctly handles cases where no overlap exists, returning 'NO' as expected.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles overlaps of any length (greater than zero and less than the length of the message) and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
