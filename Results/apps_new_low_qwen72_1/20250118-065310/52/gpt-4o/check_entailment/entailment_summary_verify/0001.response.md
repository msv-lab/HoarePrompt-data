### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over all possible split points `i` from 1 to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the string `t`).
   - For each split point, it checks if the prefix `t[:i]` is equal to the suffix `t[-i:]`.
   - If such a split is found, it constructs the candidate message `s` by removing the last `i` characters from `t`.
   - It then checks if `s + t[-i:]` equals `t` to ensure the split is valid.
   - If the split is valid, it returns "YES" followed by the candidate message `s`.
   - If no valid split is found, it returns "NO".

2. **Original Assessment Critique:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the main logic of the function.
   - However, it incorrectly states that the check `if s + t[-i:] == t` is unnecessary. This check is actually crucial because it ensures that the constructed message `s` concatenated with the suffix `t[-i:]` indeed forms the original string `t`.
   - The assessment also correctly points out that the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message `s`.

3. **Correctness of the Original Program:**
   - The original program does correctly handle the condition that the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message `s`.
   - The check `if s + t[-i:] == t` is necessary to ensure that the constructed message `s` and the suffix `t[-i:]` form the original string `t`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program is correct. It correctly identifies and handles the conditions specified in the problem description. The original assessment's suggestion to remove the check `if s + t[-i:] == t` is incorrect, as this check is essential for validating the split.

Final: **True**
