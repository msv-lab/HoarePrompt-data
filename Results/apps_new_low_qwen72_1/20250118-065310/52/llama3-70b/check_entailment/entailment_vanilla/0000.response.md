Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a substring within the input string `t` such that the suffix of `t` starting from index `i` matches the prefix of `t` up to `len(t) - i`. If such a match is found, it prints "YES" followed by the substring that could be the original message `s`. If no such match is found, it prints "NO".

However, this approach has a flaw. The condition `if t[i:] == t[:len(t - i)]` should actually be `if t[i:] == t[:len(t) - i]`. This typo might cause an error in the program. Additionally, the logic does not correctly handle cases where the overlap is less than the length of the message and greater than zero, which is a requirement according to the problem statement.

Let's correct the typo and ensure the logic is sound:

```python
def func():
    t = input().strip()
    for i in range(1, len(t) // 2 + 1):
        if t.startswith(t[i:]):
            print('YES')
            print(t[:i])
            return
    print('NO')
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- `t = input().strip()` reads the input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
- The loop iterates over possible overlap lengths from 1 to half the length of the string (inclusive).
- `if t.startswith(t[i:])` checks if the string `t` starts with the suffix of `t` starting from index `i`.
- If such a prefix-suffix match is found, it prints "YES" and the substring `t[:i]`, which is the potential original message `s`.
- If no match is found, it prints "NO".

Given the original program had a logical error and a typo, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
