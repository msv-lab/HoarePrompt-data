Postcondition: ***`t` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 3, and `i` is 3. If the substring from index `i` to the end of the string `t` is equal to the substring from the start of the string `t` to the length minus `i`, then this condition is met, and no changes are made to `t` or `i`. Otherwise, the condition is not met, and no changes are made to `t` or `i`.***
