The provided function signature does not include any parameters, but the description indicates that the function should work with a string `t`. However, since the function signature does not explicitly list `t` as a parameter, we'll consider the typical scenario where `t` might be expected as an argument. Given the context, let's assume the function should actually be defined with a parameter.

Given the corrected assumption, the function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with a length not exceeding 100 characters. The output or return value of the function is not specified in the given context, so I cannot provide a complete description of the functionality without this information.

However, based on the provided information, here is the partial description:

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with a length not exceeding 100 characters.** 

If you can provide the expected output or return value of the function, I can complete the description.
