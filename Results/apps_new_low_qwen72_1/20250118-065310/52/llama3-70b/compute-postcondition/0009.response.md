The provided code snippet performs the following actions:
- It prints 'YES' to the console.
- It prints a substring of `t` excluding the last `i` characters. Since `i` is 3, it prints `t` from the start up to but not including the last three characters.
- It then calls `exit()`, which terminates the program immediately, preventing any further code from running.

Given the initial state where `t` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 3, and `i` is 3, the code will print 'YES' and the substring of `t` as described, and then terminate the program. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged because `exit()` is called before any assignment or modification to these variables could occur.

Output State: **t is a string input by the user with a length greater than 3, i is 3**
