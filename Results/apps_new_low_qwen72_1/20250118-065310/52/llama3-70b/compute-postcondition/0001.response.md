To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will start its first iteration.

### Analysis:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(t))`.
- The `range(1, len(t))` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(t)`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the sequence generated by `range(1, len(t))` must contain at least one element.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The sequence `range(1, len(t))` will contain at least one element if `len(t)` is greater than 1.
- If `len(t)` is 1 or less, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a string input by the user.

### Required State for the Loop to Execute:
- `t` must be a string with a length greater than 1.
- The variable `i` will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a string input by the user, `len(t)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
