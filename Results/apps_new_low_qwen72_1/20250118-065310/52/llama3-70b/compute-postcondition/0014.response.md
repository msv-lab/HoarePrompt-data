Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a non-empty string `t` consisting of lowercase Latin letters (with a maximum length of 100 characters) from the user. It then checks if there exists a non-empty proper prefix of `t` that is also a suffix of `t`. If such a prefix-suffix match is found, the function prints "YES" followed by the matched prefix and terminates the program. If no such match is found, the function prints "NO" and continues execution. The function does not return any value. If the input string `t` has a length of 1, the function will always print "NO" because a single-character string cannot have a non-empty proper prefix that is also a suffix. **
