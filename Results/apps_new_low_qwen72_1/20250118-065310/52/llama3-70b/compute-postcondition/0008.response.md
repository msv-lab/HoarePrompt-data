The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than the length of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a string with a length greater than 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `t` must still have a length greater than 3 for the loop condition (`i < len(t)`) to hold true.

State: **`t` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 3, and `i` is 3.**
