The first line prints 'YES' to the console. The second line prints the substring of `t` from the beginning up to the length of `t` minus `i`. Since `i` is 2, it prints `t` without the last two characters. The third line causes the program to terminate immediately, so no further code is executed after this point.

Output State: **t is a string input by the user with a length greater than 2, i is 2, and the program has printed 'YES' and the substring of t excluding the last 2 characters, then terminated**
