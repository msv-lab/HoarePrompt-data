The provided code block performs the following actions:

1. Prints 'YES'.
2. Prints the substring of `t` from the beginning up to but not including the last character (`t[:len(t) - i]`).
3. Exits the program immediately after the print statements.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is a string input by the user.
- `len(t)` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- The substring of `t` starting from index 1 to the end (`t[i:]`) is equal to the substring of `t` from the beginning up to but not including the last character (`t[:len(t) - i]`).

From these conditions, we can infer that the string `t` must be a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward) and has at least two characters. For example, if `t` is "abba", then `t[1:]` is "bba" and `t[:len(t) - 1]` is "abb".

After executing the code:
- 'YES' is printed.
- The substring `t[:len(t) - i]` is printed, which is the string `t` without its last character.
- The program exits, and no further code is executed.

The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged because the `exit()` function terminates the program before any further changes can be made.

Output State: **t is a string input by the user, len(t) is greater than 1, i is 1, t[i:] is equal to t[:len(t) - i], 'YES' is printed, t[:len(t) - i] is printed, program exits**
