Postcondition: ***`t` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If the substring of `t` starting from index `i` to the end is equal to the substring from the beginning of `t` up to (but not including) the last `i` characters, the program prints 'YES' followed by the substring of `t` excluding the last 2 characters, and then terminates.***
