To determine the final output state after all executions of the given loop, we need to follow the provided steps and analyze the loop's behavior based on the initial state and the conditions within the loop.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a string input by the user.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(t)):
    if t[i:] == t[:len(t) - i]:
        print('YES')
        print(t[:len(t) - i])
        exit()
```

### Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices `i` from 1 to `len(t) - 1`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if the substring `t[i:]` (from index `i` to the end) is equal to the substring `t[:len(t) - i]` (from the start to the position `len(t) - i`).
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'YES' followed by the substring `t[:len(t) - i]` and then exits the program.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - The variable `i` changes in each iteration, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 until `len(t) - 1`.
   - The string `t` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - The loop will exit immediately upon finding a match, so it will not complete all iterations if a match is found.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to iterate as long as no match is found between the substrings `t[i:]` and `t[:len(t) - i]`.
   - If a match is found, the loop will print 'YES' and the matching substring, then terminate the program.
   - If no match is found, the loop will complete all iterations, but no output will be printed.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop will only execute if the length of `t` is greater than 1.
   - If the length of `t` is 1, the loop will not execute because the range `range(1, len(t))` will be empty.
   - If the length of `t` is greater than 1, the loop will check each possible substring and exit on the first match.

### Final Output State:
- **Variables that remain constant**: `t`
- **Final values of all variables**: 
  - `i` will be the value at which the loop either finds a match and exits or completes all iterations.
  - `t` remains unchanged.
- **Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute**:
  - The loop executes if `len(t) > 1`.
  - The loop does not execute if `len(t) <= 1`.

Output State: **If `len(t) > 1`, the loop will check each substring `t[i:]` against `t[:len(t) - i]` for `i` from 1 to `len(t) - 1`. If a match is found, 'YES' and the matching substring `t[:len(t) - i]` are printed, and the program exits. If no match is found, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything. If `len(t) <= 1`, the loop does not execute.**
