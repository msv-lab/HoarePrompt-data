### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Feasibility**:
   - The function `func_1` starts by calculating the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers, which is given by the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - If this `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it means it's impossible to form such a sequence, and the function returns `-1`.

2. **Determine the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:
   - The function calculates the largest possible GCD (`d`) that can be used to form the sequence by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. This ensures that the sequence will have the maximum possible GCD.
   - The remainder of `n` after subtracting `d * min_sum` is stored in `remainder`.

3. **Construct the Sequence**:
   - The initial sequence is constructed as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which ensures that each element is a multiple of `d` and the sequence is strictly increasing.
   - The `remainder` is then distributed among the elements of the sequence starting from the last element to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the sequence is successfully constructed, it is printed. If not, `-1` is printed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum is `n` and has the maximum possible GCD. The steps are logically sound and cover all edge cases, including when no such sequence exists.
