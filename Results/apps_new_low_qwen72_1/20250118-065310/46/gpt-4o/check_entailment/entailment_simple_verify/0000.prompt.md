You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence



- Annotated Code: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` = `k` * (`k` + 1) // 2, and `min_sum` ≤ `n`
    d = n // min_sum

remainder = n - d * min_sum

sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum - m (where m is the number of times the loop executes), sequence is [d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(m)] + [d * (i + 1) for i in range(m, k)], i is k - m.
    return sequence
    #The program returns a list `sequence` which is constructed as `[d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(m)] + [d * (i + 1) for i in range(m, k)]`, where `d` is `n // min_sum`, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `m` is the number of times the loop executes, and `i` is `k - m`. The exact values depend on the initial values of `n` and `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initial Check for Feasibility**: The program first checks if the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers (`min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`) exceeds `n`. If it does, it returns `-1`, which is correct because it's impossible to form such a sequence.

2. **Finding the GCD**: The program calculates the maximum possible GCD (`d`) by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. This ensures that the GCD is as large as possible while still allowing the sequence to sum up to `n`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**: The sequence is constructed by multiplying each term in the sequence `1, 2, ..., k` by the GCD `d`. This ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and each term is divisible by `d`.

4. **Adjusting the Sum**: If the sum of the sequence is less than `n`, the program adjusts the last few terms by incrementing them until the sum equals `n`. This is done by distributing the remaining difference (`remainder`) across the sequence from the end to the beginning.

5. **Output**: The program prints the sequence if it exists, or `-1` if it doesn't.

The program handles edge cases and ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing, sums to `n`, and has the maximum possible GCD. Therefore, the program is correct.
