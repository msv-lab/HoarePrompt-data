Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. This part is accurate and aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The calculation `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2` is correct. This formula gives the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the smallest possible sum for a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if `min_sum > n`. If this condition is true, it correctly returns `-1` because it is impossible to form a sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers that sum up to `n` if the minimum possible sum is greater than `n`.

4. **GCD Maximization**: The program sets `d = n // min_sum`. This is intended to find the largest possible GCD that can be used to form the sequence while keeping the sum close to `n`. However, this approach has a flaw. The value of `d` should be the greatest common divisor of the sequence, not just a divisor. The current approach may not always yield the correct GCD.

5. **Sequence Construction**: The program constructs the sequence `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which is a sequence of `k` numbers with GCD `d`. The sum of this sequence is `d * min_sum`. This part is logically sound but depends on the correctness of `d`.

6. **Adjusting the Sequence**: The program then distributes the remainder `n - d * min_sum` among the last elements of the sequence, starting from the end. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and the sum is exactly `n`. This part is also logically sound but again depends on the correctness of `d`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the sequence if it exists, otherwise it prints `-1`. This part is correct.

**Critical Flaw**:
The main issue lies in the calculation of `d`. The current method of setting `d = n // min_sum` does not guarantee that `d` is the greatest common divisor of the sequence. For example, consider `n = 12` and `k = 3`. The minimum sum is `6`, and `d = 12 // 6 = 2`. The sequence constructed is `[2, 4, 6]`, which has a GCD of `2`. However, a better sequence with a higher GCD is `[1, 4, 7]` with a GCD of `1`, which is not optimal. The correct sequence should be `[3, 4, 5]` with a GCD of `1`.

**Correct Approach**:
To ensure the GCD is maximized, a more robust approach would involve finding the largest possible GCD `g` such that `n` can be divided into `k` parts, each divisible by `g`, and the sum of these parts equals `n`. This involves iterating over possible values of `g` and checking if the conditions are met.

Given the critical flaw in the GCD calculation, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

Final: **False**
