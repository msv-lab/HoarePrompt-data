You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To assess the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct because the smallest sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers is `1, 2, 3, ..., k`, whose sum is indeed `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if `min_sum > n`. If this condition is true, it means it's impossible to form a sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers that sum up to `n`, so it returns `-1`. This is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **GCD Maximization**: The program attempts to maximize the GCD of the sequence by setting `d = n // min_sum`. This `d` is the largest possible GCD that can be used to form the sequence while keeping the sum close to `n`.

5. **Sequence Construction**: The program constructs the sequence `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which is a sequence of `k` numbers with GCD `d`. The sum of this sequence is `d * min_sum`.

6. **Adjusting the Sequence**: The program then adjusts the sequence to ensure the sum is exactly `n`. It does this by distributing the remainder `n - d * min_sum` among the last elements of the sequence, starting from the end. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and the sum is exactly `n`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the sequence if it exists, otherwise it prints `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the requirements of the problem. It ensures the sequence is strictly increasing, maximizes the GCD, and handles the case where no valid sequence exists.

Correctness: **True**
