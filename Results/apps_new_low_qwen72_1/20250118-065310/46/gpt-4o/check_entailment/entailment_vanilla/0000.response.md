Reasoning:  
To assess the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct because the smallest sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers is `1, 2, 3, ..., k`, whose sum is indeed `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if `min_sum > n`. If this condition is true, it means it's impossible to form a sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers that sum up to `n`, so it returns `-1`. This is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **GCD Maximization**: The program attempts to maximize the GCD of the sequence by setting `d = n // min_sum`. This `d` is the largest possible GCD that can be used to form the sequence while keeping the sum close to `n`.

5. **Sequence Construction**: The program constructs the sequence `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which is a sequence of `k` numbers with GCD `d`. The sum of this sequence is `d * min_sum`.

6. **Adjusting the Sequence**: The program then adjusts the sequence to ensure the sum is exactly `n`. It does this by distributing the remainder `n - d * min_sum` among the last elements of the sequence, starting from the end. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and the sum is exactly `n`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the sequence if it exists, otherwise it prints `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the requirements of the problem. It ensures the sequence is strictly increasing, maximizes the GCD, and handles the case where no valid sequence exists.

Correctness: **True**
