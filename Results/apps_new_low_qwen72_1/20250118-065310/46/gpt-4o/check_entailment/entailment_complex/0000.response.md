### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Feasibility**:
   - The program starts by calculating the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of length `k`. This is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it is impossible to form such a sequence, and the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:
   - The program then calculates `d` as `n // min_sum`. This value represents the largest possible GCD that can be used to form the sequence.
   - The remainder `n - d * min_sum` is calculated to distribute the remaining part of `n` among the sequence elements.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The sequence is initially constructed as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which ensures that each element is divisible by `d`.
   - The remainder is then distributed from the last element to the first, ensuring that the sequence remains strictly increasing and the sum equals `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the sequence is successfully constructed, it is printed. Otherwise, `-1` is printed.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Feasibility Check**: The check `min_sum > n` ensures that the problem is solvable. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to form a strictly increasing sequence of length `k` that sums to `n`.
- **GCD Calculation**: The value `d` is correctly calculated as the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, ensuring that the GCD is maximized.
- **Sequence Construction**: The sequence is constructed by multiplying each index by `d` and then distributing the remainder to ensure the sum is exactly `n`.

### Potential Issues:
- The code correctly handles the distribution of the remainder to ensure the sequence is strictly increasing and sums to `n`.
- The logic for constructing the sequence and distributing the remainder is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It checks for feasibility, calculates the GCD, constructs the sequence, and ensures the sum is `n`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
