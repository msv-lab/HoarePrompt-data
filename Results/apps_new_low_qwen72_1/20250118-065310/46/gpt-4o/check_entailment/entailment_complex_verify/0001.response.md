Reasoning: 

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. This is essential for solving the problem and is handled correctly.

2. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct because the smallest sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers is `1, 2, 3, ..., k`, whose sum is indeed `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if `min_sum > n`. If this condition is true, it means it's impossible to form a sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers that sum up to `n`, so it returns `-1`. This is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **GCD Maximization**: The program attempts to maximize the GCD of the sequence by setting `d = n // min_sum`. This is a good approach because `d` is the largest possible GCD that can be used to form the sequence while keeping the sum close to `n`.

5. **Sequence Construction**: The program constructs the sequence `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which is a sequence of `k` numbers with GCD `d`. The sum of this sequence is `d * min_sum`.

6. **Adjusting the Sequence**: The program then adjusts the sequence to ensure the sum is exactly `n`. It does this by distributing the remainder `n - d * min_sum` among the last elements of the sequence, starting from the end. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and the sum is exactly `n`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the sequence if it exists, otherwise it prints `-1`.

However, there is one subtle issue in the sequence adjustment part. When adjusting the sequence, the program distributes the remainder among the last elements of the sequence. This can potentially lead to a situation where the sequence is no longer strictly increasing if the remainder is large enough to make the difference between consecutive elements less than or equal to zero.

For example, consider `n = 10` and `k = 3`:
- `min_sum = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`
- `d = 10 // 6 = 1`
- `remainder = 10 - 1 * 6 = 4`
- Initial sequence: `[1, 2, 3]`
- After adjustment: `[1, 2, 7]` (which is not strictly increasing).

To fix this, the program should ensure that the adjustments do not violate the strictly increasing property of the sequence. One way to do this is to distribute the remainder more evenly or check the adjusted sequence to ensure it remains strictly increasing.

Given the above reasoning, the program is mostly correct but has a potential issue with the sequence adjustment that could violate the strictly increasing property. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate.

Final: **False**
