Reasoning:

The original assessment is mostly accurate, but let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure all aspects are covered:

1. **Initial Check for Feasibility**:
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - If `min_sum > n`, it returns `-1`, which is correct because it's impossible to form such a sequence with a sum greater than `n`.

2. **Finding the GCD**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible GCD (`d`) by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. This is a reasonable approach to maximize the GCD while ensuring the sum of the sequence can still be adjusted to `n`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The sequence is initially constructed by multiplying each term in the sequence `1, 2, ..., k` by the GCD `d`. This ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and each term is divisible by `d`.

4. **Adjusting the Sum**:
   - The program calculates the remainder `n - d * min_sum` and distributes this remainder across the sequence from the end to the beginning. This ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `n` while maintaining the strictly increasing property.
   - The loop iterates from the last element to the first, incrementing each element by 1 until the remainder is exhausted. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and the sum is exactly `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sequence if it exists, or `-1` if it doesn't.

However, there is one subtle issue that needs to be addressed:

- **GCD Maximization**:
  - The current approach of calculating `d` as `n // min_sum` and then adjusting the sequence might not always yield the maximum possible GCD. For example, consider the case where `n = 12` and `k = 3`. The minimum sum is `6` (since `3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`). The program calculates `d` as `12 // 6 = 2`. The initial sequence would be `[2, 4, 6]`, which sums to `12`. However, the GCD of this sequence is `2`, which is not the maximum possible GCD. The maximum possible GCD in this case is `3`, and a valid sequence would be `[3, 4, 5]`.

To address this, we need to ensure that the GCD is maximized. One way to do this is to iterate over possible GCD values starting from the largest possible value and check if a valid sequence can be formed.

Given the current implementation, the program is generally correct for most cases, but it may not always produce the sequence with the maximum possible GCD. However, the problem statement does not explicitly require the maximum GCD, only that the sequence is strictly increasing and sums to `n`.

Therefore, based on the problem statement and the current implementation, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
