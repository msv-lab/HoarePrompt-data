Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initial Check for Feasibility**: The program first checks if the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers (`min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`) exceeds `n`. If it does, it returns `-1`, which is correct because it's impossible to form such a sequence.

2. **Finding the GCD**: The program calculates the maximum possible GCD (`d`) by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. This ensures that the GCD is as large as possible while still allowing the sequence to sum up to `n`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**: The sequence is constructed by multiplying each term in the sequence `1, 2, ..., k` by the GCD `d`. This ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and each term is divisible by `d`.

4. **Adjusting the Sum**: If the sum of the sequence is less than `n`, the program adjusts the last few terms by incrementing them until the sum equals `n`. This is done by distributing the remaining difference (`remainder`) across the sequence from the end to the beginning.

5. **Output**: The program prints the sequence if it exists, or `-1` if it doesn't.

The program handles edge cases and ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing, sums to `n`, and has the maximum possible GCD. Therefore, the program is correct.
