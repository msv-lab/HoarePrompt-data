Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

# Annotated Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` = `k` * (`k` + 1) // 2, and `min_sum` ≤ `n`
    d = n // min_sum

remainder = n - d * min_sum

sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum - m (where m is the number of times the loop executes), sequence is [d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(m)] + [d * (i + 1) for i in range(m, k)], i is k - m.
    return sequence
    #The program returns a list `sequence` which is constructed as `[d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(m)] + [d * (i + 1) for i in range(m, k)]`, where `d` is `n // min_sum`, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `m` is the number of times the loop executes, and `i` is `k - m`. The exact values depend on the initial values of `n` and `k`.
