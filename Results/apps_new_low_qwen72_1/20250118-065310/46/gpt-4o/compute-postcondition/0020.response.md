The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

- **Case_1**: If certain conditions within the function lead to an invalid scenario, the function returns `-1`.
- **Case_2**: Otherwise, the function returns a list `sequence` which is constructed based on the formula `[d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(m)] + [d * (i + 1) for i in range(m, k)]`, where `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `m` is the number of times the loop executes, and `i` is `k - m`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` and either return `-1` under certain conditions or return a specific list `sequence` constructed from these parameters.
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10). It returns `-1` in certain conditions. Otherwise, it returns a list `sequence` constructed as `[d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(m)] + [d * (i + 1) for i in range(m, k)]`, where `d` is `n // min_sum`, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `m` is the number of times the loop executes, and `i` is `k - m`.**
