To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 2`.
- `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1]` with `sequence[k - 2]` incremented by 1.
- `i` is `k - 2`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` is set to `k - 1`.
3. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 2`.
4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

### Adjusting the State:
- `i` is currently `k - 2`.
- To start the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 3`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `min_sum` remains `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` remains `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` remains `n - d * min_sum - 2`.
- `sequence` remains `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1]` with `sequence[k - 2]` incremented by 1.
- `i` is now `k - 3`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 2`, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1]` with `sequence[k - 2]` incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 3`**
