The provided code snippet modifies the `sequence` and `remainder` based on the initial conditions. Specifically, it increments the last element of the `sequence` list by 1 and decreases `remainder` by 1. Let's determine the final state considering the initial conditions and the effects of the code:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`.
- `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`.
- `i` is `k - 1`.

The code snippet:
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Effect of the code:
- The last element of `sequence` (which is `sequence[k-1]`) is incremented by 1.
- `remainder` is decremented by 1.

Since `i` is `k - 1`, the last element of `sequence` is `d * k`. After the code executes, this element becomes `d * k + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum - 1, sequence is [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1], i is k - 1**
