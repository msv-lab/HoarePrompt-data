Output State: **The program returns a list `sequence` which is constructed as `[d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(m)] + [d * (i + 1) for i in range(m, k)]`, where `d` is `n // min_sum`, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `m` is the number of times the loop executes, and `i` is `k - m`. The exact values depend on the initial values of `n` and `k`.**
