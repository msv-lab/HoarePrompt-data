The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is within, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum - 1, sequence is [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1], i is k - 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
