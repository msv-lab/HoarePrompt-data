Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 2`, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1]` with `sequence[k - 2]` incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 3`. If `remainder` == 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
