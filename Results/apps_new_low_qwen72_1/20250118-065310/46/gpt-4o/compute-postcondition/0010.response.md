The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `-1`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, starting from `k - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to `k - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum - 1, sequence is [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1], i is k - 2**
