The provided code snippet modifies the `sequence` list and the `remainder` variable based on the initial conditions. Let's break down the final state considering the given initial conditions and the effects of the code:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum - 2`.
- `sequence` is initialized as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1]` with `sequence[k - 2]` incremented by 1.
- `i` is set to `k - 3`.

The code snippet:
```python
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

This code modifies `sequence` by incrementing the element at index `i` by 1 and decrements `remainder` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `k - 3`, so the element at index `k - 3` in `sequence` is incremented by 1.
- `remainder` is decremented by 1.

Combining these changes, the final state is:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, min_sum is \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \), d is \( n // \text{min_sum} \), remainder is \( n - d \times \text{min_sum} - 3 \), sequence is \([d \times (i + 1) \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(k-1)] + [d \times k + 1]\) with `sequence[k - 2]` incremented by 1 and `sequence[k - 3]` incremented by 1, i is \( k - 3 \)**.
