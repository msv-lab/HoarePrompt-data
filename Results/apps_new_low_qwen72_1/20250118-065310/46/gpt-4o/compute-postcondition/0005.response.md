To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.
- `sequence` is initialized as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `k`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `i` starts at `k - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1 (but does not include -1).

### Conditions for the First Execution:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must start at `k - 1`.
- `k` must be at least 1 (since `k` is a positive integer).

### Initial State:
- `i` must be `k - 1`.
- `k` must be a positive integer.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`.
- `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`.
- `i` is `k - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is `k - 1`**
