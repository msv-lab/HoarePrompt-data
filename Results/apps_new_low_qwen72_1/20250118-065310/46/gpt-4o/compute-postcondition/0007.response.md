Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is `k - 1`, `remainder` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
