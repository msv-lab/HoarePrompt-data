The value of `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This formula represents the sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, but now `min_sum` holds the value of the sum of the first `k` integers.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` = `k` * (`k` + 1) // 2**
