Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum - 1, sequence is [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k-1)] + [d * k + 1], i is k - 2. If remainder == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
