The code snippet performs the following operations:

1. Calculates `d` as the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`.
2. Calculates `remainder` as the difference between `n` and the product of `d` and `min_sum`.
3. Generates a list `sequence` where each element is `d` multiplied by `(i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10.
- `min_sum` = `k` * (`k` + 1) // 2.
- `min_sum` ≤ `n`.

Let's determine the final state:

1. `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`.
2. `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.
3. `sequence` is a list where each element is `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`.

The final state will include:
- The updated values of `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence`.
- The unchanged values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum, sequence is [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]**
