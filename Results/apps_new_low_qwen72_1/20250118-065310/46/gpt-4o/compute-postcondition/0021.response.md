Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10) as input and returns a result based on the following conditions:**

1. **If the minimum sum required to form a sequence of length `k` (calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`) is greater than `n`, the function returns `-1`.**
2. **Otherwise, the function constructs and returns a list `sequence` of length `k` such that the sum of the elements in `sequence` equals `n`. The elements in `sequence` are distributed as evenly as possible, with any remaining value distributed starting from the end of the list.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- **If `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum required (`k * (k + 1) // 2`), the function will return a sequence where each element is `n // min_sum` (which is 1 in this case), without any additional distribution.**
- **If `n` is much larger than the minimum sum, the function will distribute the remainder (`n - d * min_sum`) starting from the end of the list, ensuring that the sum of the elements in `sequence` equals `n`.**
- **If `k` is 1, the function will always return a list with a single element equal to `n`, as the minimum sum required is 1, and `n` can always be represented as a single-element list.**
- **The function assumes that `n` and `k` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10) and does not handle cases where these constraints are violated.**

**Final State:**
- **The function either returns `-1` if the minimum sum condition is not met, or it returns a list `sequence` of length `k` where the sum of the elements in `sequence` equals `n`. The elements in `sequence` are distributed as evenly as possible, with any remaining value added to the elements starting from the end of the list.**
