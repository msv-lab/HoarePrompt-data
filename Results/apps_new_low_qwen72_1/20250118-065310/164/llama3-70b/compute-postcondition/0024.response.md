The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This operation does not modify any of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, all the conditions and variable values from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, `g` is the index of the character 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of the character 'T' in `s`, `i` is `n-1` after the loop completes, `g` is not -1, `t` is not -1, the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and for every step of size `k` from `g` to `t` (inclusive), the character at the corresponding position in `s` is not '#'. 'YES' has been printed.**
