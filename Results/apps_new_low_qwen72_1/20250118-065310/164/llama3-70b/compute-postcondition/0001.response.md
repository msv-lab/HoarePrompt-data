To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once.
- `g` is -1.
- `t` is -1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `range(n)` produces a sequence of integers starting from 0 up to `n-1`.
- For `range(n)` to produce this sequence, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
2. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` with specific character constraints.
   - `g` is -1.
   - `t` is -1.

Since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 100 inclusive, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already satisfied by the given condition).
- `i` is 0 (since the loop starts with `i` set to 0).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, `g` is -1, `t` is -1, `i` is 0**
