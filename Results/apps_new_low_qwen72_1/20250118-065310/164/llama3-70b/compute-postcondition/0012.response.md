Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', then `g` is 0 and `t` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'T', then `t` is 0 and `g` is -1 if `s[1]` is 'T', otherwise `g` remains -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` and `t` are both 1 if `s[1]` is 'T', otherwise `g` and `t` remain -1.***
