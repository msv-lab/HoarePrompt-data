The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The function also accepts a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once.

The function returns a result based on the given parameters, but the specific return conditions are not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, I cannot fully describe the return value without additional information. However, based on the provided constraints, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return conditions are not specified.**
