Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no explicit parameters but reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input, followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once. It determines whether it is possible to move from the position of 'G' to the position of 'T' in the string `s` by making jumps of size `k` without landing on any '#' character. If such a path exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. The function ensures that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, and `s` is a valid string as described. Edge cases include scenarios where 'G' or 'T' are not found in the string, which would result in 'NO' being printed. **
