Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, `g` is the index of the character 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of the character 'T' in `s`. The loop will always execute `n` times, and `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes. Additionally, `g` is not -1 and `t` is not -1. The absolute difference between `t` and `g` is not divisible by `k`, or there exists at least one index `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k + 1` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#'.***
