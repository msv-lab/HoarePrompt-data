To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head includes the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once.
- `i` is 0.
- If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', then `g` is 0 and `t` is -1.
- If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'T', then `t` is 0 and `g` is -1.
- If the character at index 0 of `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` and `t` remain -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', then `g` is 0 and `t` is -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'T', then `t` is 0 and `g` is -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` and `t` remain -1.**
