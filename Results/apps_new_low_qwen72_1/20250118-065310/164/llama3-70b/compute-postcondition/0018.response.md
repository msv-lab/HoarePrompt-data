Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `s[i]` is 'G', `g` is 2 and `t` is -1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', `t` is 0 and `g` is 2 if the character at index 0 of `s` is 'T', `t` is 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T' and `s[1]` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains -1. If `s[i]` is not 'G', `t` is 2 if `s[i]` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', then `g` is 1 and `t` is 2 if `s[i]` is 'T', otherwise `t` is -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'T', then `t` is 2 and `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G', otherwise `g` remains -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G', otherwise `g` remains -1, and `t` is 2 if `s[i]` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains -1.***
