The code snippet `g = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `g`. This changes the value of `g` from its initial state, which could be 1 or -1 depending on the conditions given in the initial state, to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `g` is 2, `t` is -1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', `t` is 0 and `g` is 2 if the character at index 0 of `s` is 'T', `t` is 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T' and `s[1]` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains -1.**
