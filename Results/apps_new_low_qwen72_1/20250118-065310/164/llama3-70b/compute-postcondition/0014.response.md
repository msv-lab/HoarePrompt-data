The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. The loop condition is that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `n` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', then `g` is 1 and `t` is -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is 'T', then `t` is 0 and `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G', otherwise `g` remains -1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G', otherwise `g` remains -1, and `t` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains -1.**
