The provided code snippet reads two inputs: the first line reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, and the second line reads a string `s` of length `n`. It also initializes two variables `g` and `t` to -1. These variables are intended to store the positions of 'G' and 'T' in the string `s`, but the code snippet provided does not actually find these positions or modify these variables. Therefore, they remain at their initial values of -1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1.
- A string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once.

After executing the code:
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user.
- `s` is updated to the string provided by the user.
- `g` and `t` remain -1.

Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n-1 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' where 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once, g is -1, t is -1**
