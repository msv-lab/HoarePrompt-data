Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the two integers `n` and `k` and the string `s` representing the line of cells. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Position Identification**: The function identifies the positions of 'G' (grasshopper) and 'T' (target insect) in the string `s`. If either 'G' or 'T' is not found, it prints "NO". This is consistent with the problem's guarantee that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string. However, the function should not print "NO" if 'G' or 'T' are not found because the problem guarantees their presence. This part of the function is logically correct but redundant.

3. **Jump Feasibility Check**:
   - **Distance Modulo Check**: The function checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`. This ensures that the grasshopper can reach the target position by making jumps of length `k`. This check is necessary and correct.
   - **Obstacle Check**: The function uses a generator expression to check if all intermediate cells (including the start and end cells) are not obstacles ('#'). The generator expression iterates over the possible positions the grasshopper would land on during its jumps. However, the use of `(g + i * k) % n` is incorrect because the modulo operation is not needed here. The grasshopper jumps linearly within the bounds of the string, and the modulo operation could incorrectly wrap around the string, leading to incorrect results. Instead, the correct check should be `(g + i * k)` and `(t + i * k)` without the modulo operation.

4. **Output**: Based on the above checks, the function prints "YES" if the grasshopper can reach the target without encountering an obstacle, otherwise it prints "NO".

However, the modulo operation in the obstacle check is a critical error. The correct implementation should avoid using modulo and instead ensure that the grasshopper stays within the bounds of the string.

Final: **False**

The function has a logical error in the obstacle check due to the incorrect use of the modulo operation, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the function is not correct.
