Reasoning:

The provided function `func` correctly addresses the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads two integers `n` and `k` and a string `s` from the standard input. This aligns with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Position Finding**: The function iterates through the string `s` to find the positions of 'G' (grasshopper) and 'T' (insect). If either 'G' or 'T' is not found, the function prints 'NO' and exits. This handles edge cases where the required characters are missing.

3. **Distance Check**: The function checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`. This ensures that the grasshopper can reach the insect by making jumps of length `k`.

4. **Obstacle Check**: The function uses a generator expression within the `all` function to check if all intermediate cells (from the starting position to the target position, jumping by `k`) are not obstacles ('#'). This ensures that the grasshopper can only land on empty cells or the target cell.

5. **Output**: Based on the above checks, the function prints 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the insect, and 'NO' otherwise.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: `5 2`, `#G#T#`
  - `G` is at index 1, `T` is at index 3.
  - `abs(3 - 1) % 2 == 0` and the cells `[1, 3]` are not obstacles.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Example 2**: 
  - Input: `6 1`, `T....G`
  - `G` is at index 5, `T` is at index 0.
  - `abs(5 - 0) % 1 == 0` and the cells `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` are not obstacles.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Example 3**: 
  - Input: `7 3`, `T..#..G`
  - `G` is at index 6, `T` is at index 0.
  - `abs(6 - 0) % 3 == 0` but the cell at index 3 is an obstacle.
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 4**: 
  - Input: `6 2`, `..GT..`
  - `G` is at index 2, `T` is at index 3.
  - `abs(3 - 2) % 2 != 0`.
  - Output: `NO`

The function handles all the given examples correctly and adheres to the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
