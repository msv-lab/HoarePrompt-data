Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition that checks if the path is clear of obstacles. Specifically, the line `all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` uses modulo `n` which can cause incorrect indexing when `g + i * k` exceeds the length of the string `s`. This can lead to incorrect results when the grasshopper needs to jump over multiple positions.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2
#G#T#
```
Here, `g = 1`, `t = 3`, and `k = 2`. The grasshopper can jump from index 1 to index 3, which is valid. However, the condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` will incorrectly check `s[1 % 5]`, `s[3 % 5]`, and `s[5 % 5]`, which includes `s[0]` (an obstacle). This will incorrectly return `False` even though the jump is valid.

A corrected version of the condition should avoid using modulo `n` and instead directly check the indices within the valid range.
