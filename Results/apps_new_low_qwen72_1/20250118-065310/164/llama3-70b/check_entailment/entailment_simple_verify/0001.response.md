Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the two integers `n` and `k` and the string `s` representing the line of cells. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Position Identification**: The function identifies the positions of 'G' (grasshopper) and 'T' (target insect) in the string `s`. If either 'G' or 'T' is not found, it prints "NO". This is consistent with the problem's guarantee that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.

3. **Jump Feasibility Check**:
   - **Distance Modulo Check**: The function checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`. This ensures that the grasshopper can reach the target position by making jumps of length `k`.
   - **Obstacle Check**: The function uses a generator expression to check if all intermediate cells (including the start and end cells) are not obstacles ('#'). The generator expression iterates over the possible positions the grasshopper would land on during its jumps. However, there is a subtle issue with the modulo operation used in the generator expression: `s[(g + i * k) % n]`. This operation wraps around the string, which is not necessary since the problem does not involve circular movement. Instead, we should ensure that the positions are within the bounds of the string `s`.

4. **Output**: Based on the above checks, the function prints "YES" if the grasshopper can reach the target without encountering an obstacle, otherwise it prints "NO".

Despite the minor issue with the modulo operation, the function still works correctly because the modulo operation does not affect the correctness of the program in this context. The modulo operation is unnecessary but does not introduce any errors.

Final: **True**
