You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.

    if g == -1 or t == -1:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition that checks if the path is clear of obstacles. Specifically, the line `all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` uses modulo `n` which can cause incorrect indexing when `g + i * k` exceeds the length of the string `s`. This can lead to incorrect results when the grasshopper needs to jump over multiple positions.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2
#G#T#
```
Here, `g = 1`, `t = 3`, and `k = 2`. The grasshopper can jump from index 1 to index 3, which is valid. However, the condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` will incorrectly check `s[1 % 5]`, `s[3 % 5]`, and `s[5 % 5]`, which includes `s[0]` (an obstacle). This will incorrectly return `False` even though the jump is valid.

A corrected version of the condition should avoid using modulo `n` and instead directly check the indices within the valid range.
