    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with each query being a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the result of each query. For each query, if there exists a `d` in `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` contains 1. Otherwise, if no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, `results` contains the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`. If no such `d` exists, `results` contains -1. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the result of each query from the `queries` list. Each result is determined based on the conditions: if there exists a `d` in the query's `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, the result is 1. Otherwise, if no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, the result is the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`. If no such `d` exists, the result is -1. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of queries) and `queries` (a list of lists, where each inner list represents a query). Each query consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and `n` pairs of integers `(d_i, h_i)` (1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9), representing the number of heads reduced and the number of heads grown for each blow type. The function processes each query and returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the result of each query. The result for each query is determined as follows:

1. If there exists a `d` in the query's `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, the result is 1.
2. If no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, the result is the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`, where `max_single_blow` is the maximum `d` and `max_effective_blow` is the maximum value of `d - h` for all `d > h`.
3. If no such `d` exists, the result is -1.

The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` is 0 (i.e., no blows are provided in a query), the function will still execute and return -1 for that query since there are no valid `d` values to compare against `x`.
- If `x` is 0, the function will correctly return 1 for that query because any non-negative `d` will satisfy `d >= x`.
- If all `d` values are less than `x` and all `d` values are less than or equal to their corresponding `h` values, the function will correctly return -1 for that query.
- The function assumes that `queries` is well-formed and each inner list contains exactly `n + 1` elements, where the first element is `n` and the next `n` elements are pairs of `(d_i, h_i)`. If this assumption is violated, the function may raise an error or produce incorrect results.
