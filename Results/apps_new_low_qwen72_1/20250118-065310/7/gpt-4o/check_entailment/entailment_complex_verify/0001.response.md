Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly processes the input and handles each query as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes this list to extract the number of queries `t` and the details of each query, including the number of blows `n`, the initial number of heads `x`, and the pairs `(d_i, h_i)` for each blow type.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program initializes variables to keep track of the maximum single blow (`max_single_blow`) and the most effective blow (`max_effective_blow`).
   - It iterates through each blow type to:
     - Check if any blow can immediately defeat Zmei Gorynich (`if d >= x`). If so, it appends `1` to the results and breaks out of the loop.
     - Update `max_single_blow` to the maximum value of `d`.
     - Update `max_effective_blow` to the maximum value of `d - h` for all `d > h`.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - If no immediate defeat is possible and no effective blow is found (`max_effective_blow <= 0`), the function appends `-1` to the results, indicating that Zmei Gorynich cannot be defeated.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the remaining heads after the first best possible blow (`remaining_heads = x - max_single_blow`) and determines the number of additional blows needed using the formula `(remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`. This formula ensures that any remaining fraction of a blow is counted as a full additional blow.
   - The total number of blows required is then `additional_blows + 1` (including the initial best possible blow).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as:
     - `n` being 0 (no blows provided), returning `-1`.
     - `x` being 0, returning `1` since any non-negative `d` will satisfy `d >= x`.
     - All `d` values being less than `x` and all `d` values being less than or equal to their corresponding `h` values, returning `-1`.

The solution is logically sound and efficiently processes the input to produce the correct output for each query.

Final: **True**
