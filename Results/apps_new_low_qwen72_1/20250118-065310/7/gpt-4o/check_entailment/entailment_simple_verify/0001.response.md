Reasoning:
The provided solution follows a logical and efficient approach to solving the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it into a structured format. This is a common and efficient way to handle input in competitive programming scenarios.

2. **Query Processing**: Each query is processed independently, which is appropriate given the problem statement specifies that each query is independent.

3. **Immediate Defeat Check**: The function first checks if any single blow can immediately defeat Zmei Gorynich by cutting off all its heads in one go (`if d >= x`). If such a blow exists, the function returns `1` immediately. This is correct because if any single blow can reduce the number of heads to zero or less, only one blow is needed.

4. **Effective Blow Calculation**: If no immediate defeat is possible, the function looks for the most effective blow, defined as the blow that reduces the number of heads by the greatest amount relative to the number of heads grown back (`max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`). This is crucial because the goal is to minimize the number of blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich. The function also keeps track of the maximum number of heads that can be cut in a single blow (`max_single_blow = max(max_single_blow, d)`).

5. **Defeat Impossibility Check**: If the most effective blow does not reduce the number of heads (`max_effective_blow <= 0`), it means Zmei Gorynich cannot be defeated, and the function returns `-1`. This is correct because if every blow results in a net increase in heads, it is impossible to defeat the monster.

6. **Additional Blows Calculation**: If the most effective blow can reduce the number of heads, the function calculates the number of additional blows needed to defeat Zmei Gorynich using the formula `(remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`. This formula ensures that any remaining fraction of a blow is counted as a full additional blow, which is necessary to ensure the monster is defeated.

7. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed out at the end, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

The logic and steps taken in the program are well-reasoned and correctly address the problem. The solution efficiently processes the input and computes the correct output for each query.

Final: **True**
