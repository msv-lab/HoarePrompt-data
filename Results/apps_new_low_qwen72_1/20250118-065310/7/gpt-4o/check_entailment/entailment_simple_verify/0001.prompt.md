You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich — a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads! 

 $m$ 

Initially Zmei Gorynich has $x$ heads. You can deal $n$ types of blows. If you deal a blow of the $i$-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by $min(d_i, curX)$, there $curX$ is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows $h_i$ new heads. If $curX = 0$ then Gorynich is defeated. 

You can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.

For example, if $curX = 10$, $d = 7$, $h = 10$ then the number of heads changes to $13$ (you cut $7$ heads off, but then Zmei grows $10$ new ones), but if $curX = 10$, $d = 11$, $h = 100$ then number of heads changes to $0$ and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.

Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) – the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le x \le 10^9$) — the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.

The following $n$ lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The $i$-th line contains two integers $d_i$ and $h_i$ ($1 \le d_i, h_i \le 10^9$) — the description of the $i$-th blow.


-----Output-----

For each query print the minimum number of blows you have to deal to defeat Zmei Gorynich. 

If Zmei Gorynuch cannot be defeated print $-1$.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 10
6 3
8 2
1 4
4 10
4 1
3 2
2 6
1 100
2 15
10 11
14 100

Output
2
3
-1



-----Note-----

In the first query you can deal the first blow (after that the number of heads changes to $10 - 6 + 3 = 7$), and then deal the second blow.

In the second query you just deal the first blow three times, and Zmei is defeated. 

In third query you can not defeat Zmei Gorynich. Maybe it's better to convince it to stop fighting?

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with each query being a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the result of each query. For each query, if there exists a `d` in `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` contains 1. Otherwise, if no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, `results` contains the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`. If no such `d` exists, `results` contains -1. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the result of each query from the `queries` list. Each result is determined based on the conditions: if there exists a `d` in the query's `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, the result is 1. Otherwise, if no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, the result is the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`. If no such `d` exists, the result is -1. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided solution reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it into a structured format for easier handling. It then processes each query independently. For each query, it checks if any single blow can immediately defeat Zmei Gorynich by cutting off all its heads in one go (`if d >= x`). If such a blow exists, the function returns `1` immediately as only one blow is needed.

If no such immediate defeat is possible, the function then looks for the most effective blow, defined as the blow that reduces the number of heads by the greatest amount relative to the number of heads grown back (`max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`). This is crucial because the goal is to minimize the number of blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich.

The function also keeps track of the maximum number of heads that can be cut in a single blow (`max_single_blow = max(max_single_blow, d)`). This is used to calculate the remaining heads after the first best possible blow.

If the most effective blow does not reduce the number of heads (`max_effective_blow <= 0`), it means Zmei Gorynich cannot be defeated, and the function returns `-1`.

Otherwise, the function calculates the number of additional blows needed to defeat Zmei Gorynich using the formula `(remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`, which ensures that any remaining fraction of a blow is counted as a full additional blow.

This approach is logically sound and correctly handles the problem as described. The solution efficiently processes the input and computes the correct output for each query.
