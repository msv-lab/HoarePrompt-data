You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich — a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads! 

 $m$ 

Initially Zmei Gorynich has $x$ heads. You can deal $n$ types of blows. If you deal a blow of the $i$-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by $min(d_i, curX)$, there $curX$ is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows $h_i$ new heads. If $curX = 0$ then Gorynich is defeated. 

You can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.

For example, if $curX = 10$, $d = 7$, $h = 10$ then the number of heads changes to $13$ (you cut $7$ heads off, but then Zmei grows $10$ new ones), but if $curX = 10$, $d = 11$, $h = 100$ then number of heads changes to $0$ and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.

Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) – the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le x \le 10^9$) — the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.

The following $n$ lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The $i$-th line contains two integers $d_i$ and $h_i$ ($1 \le d_i, h_i \le 10^9$) — the description of the $i$-th blow.


-----Output-----

For each query print the minimum number of blows you have to deal to defeat Zmei Gorynich. 

If Zmei Gorynuch cannot be defeated print $-1$.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 10
6 3
8 2
1 4
4 10
4 1
3 2
2 6
1 100
2 15
10 11
14 100

Output
2
3
-1



-----Note-----

In the first query you can deal the first blow (after that the number of heads changes to $10 - 6 + 3 = 7$), and then deal the second blow.

In the second query you just deal the first blow three times, and Zmei is defeated. 

In third query you can not defeat Zmei Gorynich. Maybe it's better to convince it to stop fighting?

Each result is determined based on the conditions: if there exists a `d` in the query's `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, the result is 1. Otherwise, if no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, the result is the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`. If no such `d` exists, the result is -1. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it handles the calculation of the minimum number of blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `remaining_heads` is calculated and used to determine the additional blows needed.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
remaining_heads = x - max_single_blow
additional_blows = (remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow
results.append(additional_blows + 1)
```

### Issue Explanation:
1. **Initial Reduction of Heads**: The code reduces the initial number of heads `x` by `max_single_blow` before calculating the additional blows needed. This is incorrect because the maximum single blow might not be the best first move. The optimal strategy might involve using the most effective blow (where `d > h`) first to minimize the total number of blows.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Additional Blows**: After reducing the heads by `max_single_blow`, the code calculates the additional blows needed using the formula `(remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`. This formula assumes that the remaining heads can be reduced in chunks of `max_effective_blow`, which might not be accurate if the most effective blow is not the best first move.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 10
6 3
8 2
1 4
```
- Initial heads: 10
- Blows: (6, 3), (8, 2), (1, 4)

The correct sequence of moves to defeat Zmei Gorynich is:
1. Use the blow (8, 2): Heads change to \(10 - 8 + 2 = 4\).
2. Use the blow (6, 3): Heads change to \(4 - 6 + 3 = 1\).
3. Use the blow (6, 3): Heads change to \(1 - 6 + 3 = -2\) (which means Zmei is defeated).

The program, however, will incorrectly calculate the minimum number of blows as follows:
1. It will first reduce the heads by `max_single_blow` (which is 8): \(10 - 8 = 2\).
2. It will then calculate the additional blows needed using the formula: \((2 + 6 - 1) // 6 = 1\).
3. The total number of blows will be \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is incorrect.

The correct answer should be 3, but the program outputs 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the logical error in the calculation of the minimum number of blows.
