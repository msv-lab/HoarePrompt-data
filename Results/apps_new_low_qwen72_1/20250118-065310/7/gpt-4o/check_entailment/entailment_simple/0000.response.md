Reasoning:  
The program seems to correctly follow the logic needed to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the data to extract the number of queries and the details of each query (number of blows, initial heads, and the effects of each blow).

2. **Query Processing**: For each query, it initializes variables to track the maximum single blow (`max_single_blow`) and the most effective blow (`max_effective_blow`).

3. **Blow Analysis**:
   - If any blow can immediately defeat the dragon (i.e., `d >= x`), the result is 1.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the maximum single blow (`max_single_blow`) and the most effective blow (`max_effective_blow`), which is the difference between the damage and the growth (`d - h`).

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - If no effective blow exists (i.e., `max_effective_blow <= 0`), the result is -1, indicating the dragon cannot be defeated.
   - If an effective blow exists, it calculates the number of additional blows needed to reduce the remaining heads to zero or less. This is done using the formula `(remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`.

5. **Output**: The program appends the result for each query to the `results` list and prints the results at the end.

The logic and calculations appear to be correct and align with the problem requirements. The program handles edge cases and ensures that the minimum number of blows is calculated accurately.

Correctness: **True**
