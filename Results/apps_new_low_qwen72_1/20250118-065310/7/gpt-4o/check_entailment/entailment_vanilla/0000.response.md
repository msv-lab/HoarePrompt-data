Reasoning:  
The provided solution reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it into a structured format for easier handling. It then processes each query independently. For each query, it checks if any single blow can immediately defeat Zmei Gorynich by cutting off all its heads in one go (`if d >= x`). If such a blow exists, the function returns `1` immediately as only one blow is needed.

If no such immediate defeat is possible, the function then looks for the most effective blow, defined as the blow that reduces the number of heads by the greatest amount relative to the number of heads grown back (`max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`). This is crucial because the goal is to minimize the number of blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich.

The function also keeps track of the maximum number of heads that can be cut in a single blow (`max_single_blow = max(max_single_blow, d)`). This is used to calculate the remaining heads after the first best possible blow.

If the most effective blow does not reduce the number of heads (`max_effective_blow <= 0`), it means Zmei Gorynich cannot be defeated, and the function returns `-1`.

Otherwise, the function calculates the number of additional blows needed to defeat Zmei Gorynich using the formula `(remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`, which ensures that any remaining fraction of a blow is counted as a full additional blow.

This approach is logically sound and correctly handles the problem as described. The solution efficiently processes the input and computes the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
