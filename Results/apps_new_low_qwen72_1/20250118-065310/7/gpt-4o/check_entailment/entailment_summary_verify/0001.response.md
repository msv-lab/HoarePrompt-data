Reasoning:
The provided solution reads and processes the input data efficiently, converting it into a structured format that makes it easy to handle each query. The logic within `func_1` is designed to determine the minimum number of blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich or to determine if it is impossible to do so.

1. **Immediate Defeat Check**: The function first checks if any single blow can immediately defeat Zmei Gorynich by cutting off all its heads in one go (`if d >= x`). If such a blow exists, the function correctly returns `1` immediately, as only one blow is needed. This part of the logic is correct and efficient.

2. **Most Effective Blow Calculation**: If no immediate defeat is possible, the function then looks for the most effective blow, defined as the blow that reduces the number of heads by the greatest amount relative to the number of heads grown back (`max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`). This step is crucial because it helps identify the blow that, when used repeatedly, will minimize the number of blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich.

3. **Handling Ineffective Blows**: The function correctly identifies if no effective blow exists (`if max_effective_blow <= 0`) and returns `-1` in such cases, indicating that Zmei Gorynich cannot be defeated. This is a necessary check to ensure the function handles cases where defeat is impossible.

4. **Calculating Additional Blows**: If an effective blow exists, the function calculates the remaining heads after applying the most effective single blow and then determines the number of additional blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich using the formula `(remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`. This formula ensures that any remaining fraction of a blow is counted as a full additional blow, which is a correct and efficient way to compute the minimum number of blows.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as:
   - If `n` is 0 (no blows provided), the function will return `-1` for that query.
   - If `x` is 0, the function will return `1` for that query because any non-negative `d` will satisfy `d >= x`.
   - If all `d` values are less than `x` and all `d` values are less than or equal to their corresponding `h` values, the function will return `-1` for that query.

The function assumes that the input is well-formed and each query contains exactly `n + 1` elements, where the first element is `n` and the next `n` elements are pairs of `(d_i, h_i)`. This assumption is reasonable given the problem constraints and the input format.

Overall, the logic and implementation of the function are sound and correctly handle the problem as described.

Final: **True**
