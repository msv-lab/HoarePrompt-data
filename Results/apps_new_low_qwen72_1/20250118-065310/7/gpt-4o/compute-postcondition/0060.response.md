The value of `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `d`. Since `d` is part of the current tuple being processed in `blows`, this operation ensures that `max_single_blow` reflects the highest value encountered so far between the current `max_single_blow` and `d`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `d >= x`, `results` includes an additional 1. `n` is the first integer from the next query, `x` is the second integer from the next query, `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one more element, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`, otherwise `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged, `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`.**
