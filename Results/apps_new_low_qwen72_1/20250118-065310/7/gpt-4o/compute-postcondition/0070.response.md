Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with each query being a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the result of each query. For each query, if there exists a `d` in `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` contains 1. Otherwise, if no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, `results` contains the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`. If no such `d` exists, `results` contains -1. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`.**

Explanation:
- **Constant Variables**: `t` remains constant throughout the loop, representing the total number of queries.
- **Final Values of Variables**:
  - `queries`: Remains unchanged, as it is only iterated over.
  - `results`: Contains the results of each query after processing, with each result being either 1, -1, or the calculated number of blows.
  - `n`, `x`, and `blows` are updated per query but reset at the start of each iteration.
  - `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` are recalculated for each query based on the current `blows`.
- **Conditions for Execution**:
  - The loop executes once for each query in `queries`.
  - The inner loop iterates over each pair `(d, h)` in `blows` to find the maximum single blow and the most effective blow.
  - The loop appends 1 to `results` if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`.
  - If no `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop calculates the number of additional blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less using the most effective blow and appends this value to `results`.
  - If no effective blow exists (`max_effective_blow` ≤ 0), the loop appends -1 to `results`.
