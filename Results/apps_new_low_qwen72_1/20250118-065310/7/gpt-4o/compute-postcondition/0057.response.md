To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the objects in the loop head:

- The loop iterates over `blows`, which is a list of tuples `(d, h)`.
- Each tuple `(d, h)` is unpacked into variables `d` and `h`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries.
- `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x` and, if the condition `d >= x` is true, `results` includes an additional 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the next query.
- `x` is the second integer from the next query.
- `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one element.
- `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `d`.
- `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`, otherwise `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged.
- `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`.

### Adjusting the States

1. **`blows`**: The loop iterates over `blows`, so the next iteration will use the next tuple `(d, h)` in the list.
2. **`d` and `h`**: These variables are updated with the values from the next tuple in `blows`.

### Updated State

- The list `blows` must have at least one more tuple for the loop to execute again.
- The variables `d` and `h` will be set to the values of the next tuple in `blows`.

### Final State

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x` and, if the condition `d >= x` is true, `results` includes an additional 1, `n` is the first integer from the next query, `x` is the second integer from the next query, `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one more element, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `d`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`, otherwise `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged, `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`. `d` and `h` are the values of the next tuple in `blows`.**
