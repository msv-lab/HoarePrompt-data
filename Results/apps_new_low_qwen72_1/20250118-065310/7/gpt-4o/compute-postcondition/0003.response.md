To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing:
  - An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100),
  - An integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9),
  - `n` pairs of integers `(d_i, h_i)` where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9.
- `queries` must have at least one query.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first integer from the first query.
- `x` is the second integer from the first query.
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query.
- `max_single_blow` is 0.
- `max_effective_blow` is -inf.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (d, h) in blows:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the list `blows`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `blows` must contain at least one pair of integers `(d, h)`.

### Required State:
- `blows` must have at least one pair of integers `(d, h)`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the list `blows` must have at least one pair of integers `(d, h)`. The other variables (`t`, `queries`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `max_single_blow`, `max_effective_blow`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they provide context for the loop's operation.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, `queries` must have at least one query, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query and must have at least one pair of integers (d, h), `max_single_blow` is 0, `max_effective_blow` is -inf**
