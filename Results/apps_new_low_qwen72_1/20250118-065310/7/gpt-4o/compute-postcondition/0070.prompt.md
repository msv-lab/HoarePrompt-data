Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of queries. Each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), followed by n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of heads reduced and the number of heads grown for each blow type. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for query in queries:
    n, x = query[0]
    blows = query[1:]
    max_single_blow = 0
    max_effective_blow = float('-inf')
    for d, h in blows:
        if d >= x:
            results.append(1)
            break
        max_single_blow = max(max_single_blow, d)
        if d > h:
            max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)
    else:
        if max_effective_blow <= 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            remaining_heads = x - max_single_blow
            additional_blows = (remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1
                ) // max_effective_blow
            results.append(additional_blows + 1)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, `queries` must have at least one query, `results` is [1] if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `results` is [additional_blows + 1] where `additional_blows` is calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`, `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value of `d` from `blows`, and `max_effective_blow` is the maximum value of `d - h` where `d > h` in `blows`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` may contain 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value of `d` found in `blows` or 0 if no such value exists, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum value of `d - h` for all `d` > `h` in `blows` or negative infinity if no such value exists. If the loop completes without appending 1 to `results`, `results` will contain either -1 (if `max_effective_blow` ≤ 0) or the number of additional blows required to reduce `x` to zero using the most effective blow plus one.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1 for each query where any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or the number of additional blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less if no `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. `n` is the first integer from the last processed query, `x` is the second integer from the last processed query, `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have been processed completely for each query, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value of `d` encountered across all queries, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum value of `d - h` encountered where `d` > `h` across all queries, `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
