To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries.
- `results` may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- `n` is the first integer from the second query.
- `x` is the second integer from the second query.
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element.
- `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`.
- If `d` > `h`, `max_effective_blow` is `d - h`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains negative infinity.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (d, h) in blows:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the list `blows`, which is a list of tuples `(d, h)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the list `blows` must have at least one more tuple `(d, h)`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries.
- `results` may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- `n` is the first integer from the second query.
- `x` is the second integer from the second query.
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element.
- `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`.
- If `d` > `h`, `max_effective_blow` is `d - h`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains negative infinity.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only objects in the loop head are `d` and `h`, which are elements of the list `blows`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the list `blows` must have at least one more tuple `(d, h)`.

### New State:
- The list `blows` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time.
- The next tuple `(d, h)` will be the second element in the list `blows`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least two elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, if `d` > `h`, `max_effective_blow` is `d - h`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains negative infinity.**
