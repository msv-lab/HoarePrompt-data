The code snippet updates the value of `max_effective_blow` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `d - h`.

- `max_effective_blow` is updated based on the comparison between its current value and the result of `d - h`.
- The values of `t`, `queries`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `blows`, and `query` remain unchanged.
- The length of `queries` is still greater than the current index of `query`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `d >= x`, `results` includes an additional 1. `n` is the first integer from the next query, `x` is the second integer from the next query, `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one more element, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`, `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`.**
