The provided code snippet consists of two lines:
1. `results.append(1)` - This line appends the integer 1 to the `results` list.
2. `break` - This line is used to exit a loop immediately. However, since there is no loop in the context, this line would cause a `SyntaxError`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `queries` is a list of queries.
- `results` is [1] if `d` ≥ `x`, otherwise `results` is [].
- `n` is the first integer from the first query.
- `x` is the second integer from the first query.
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query.
- `max_single_blow` is `d`.
- `max_effective_blow` is `d - h` if `d` > `h`; otherwise, it remains -inf.

After executing the code snippet:
- The `results` list will have an additional 1 appended to it, making it either [1, 1] or [1] depending on the initial state of `results`.
- The `break` statement would cause a `SyntaxError` because it is outside of a loop.

Since the `break` statement causes a syntax error, the code execution would terminate prematurely, and the `results` list would remain unchanged in practice. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we will assume the code is executed without considering the syntax error.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, queries is a list of queries, results is [1, 1], n is the first integer from the first query, x is the second integer from the first query, blows is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, max_single_blow is d, max_effective_blow is d - h if d > h; otherwise, max_effective_blow is -inf**
