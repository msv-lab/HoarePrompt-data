The line of code updates the value of `max_effective_blow` by taking the maximum between its current value and the value of `d - h`.

- If `d > h`, then `max_effective_blow` was initially set to `d - h` or `-inf` (if `d - h` was not greater than `h` before). Now, it is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.
- If `d ≤ h`, then `max_effective_blow` remains `-inf` unless a previous `d - h` was greater than `h`, in which case it would have been set to that value.

Since `d` and `h` are the values of the next element in `blows`, this operation is specific to the current `d` and `h` being processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries, `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, `max_single_blow` is `max(d, d)`, `max_effective_blow` is `max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`, `d` and `h` are the values of the next element in `blows`. If `d` ≥ `x`, `results` is [1, 1, 1]; otherwise, `results` is [1].**
