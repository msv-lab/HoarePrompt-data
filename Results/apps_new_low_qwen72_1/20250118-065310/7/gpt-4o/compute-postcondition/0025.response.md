The provided code snippet initializes several variables based on the second query in the `queries` list. It then calculates the `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` from the `blows` list. Let's analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9
- `queries` must have at least two queries
- `results` is [1] if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `results` is [additional_blows + 1] where `additional_blows` is calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`
- `n` is the first integer from the second query
- `x` is the second integer from the second query
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query
- `max_single_blow` is the maximum value of `d` from `blows`
- `max_effective_blow` is the maximum value of `d - h` where `d > h` in `blows`

Code Snippet:
```python
n, x = query[0]
blows = query[1:]
max_single_blow = 0
max_effective_blow = float('-inf')
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `n, x = query[0]` extracts the first two elements from the second query in `queries` and assigns them to `n` and `x`, respectively.
2. The second line `blows = query[1:]` creates a list `blows` containing all elements from the second query starting from the third element.
3. The third line `max_single_blow = 0` initializes `max_single_blow` to 0.
4. The fourth line `max_effective_blow = float('-inf')` initializes `max_effective_blow` to negative infinity.

Final Output State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `queries` remains a list of queries with at least two queries
- `results` is not affected by this code snippet
- `n` is the first integer from the second query
- `x` is the second integer from the second query
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query
- `max_single_blow` is 0
- `max_effective_blow` is negative infinity

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, queries is a list of queries with at least two queries, results is not affected, n is the first integer from the second query, x is the second integer from the second query, blows is a list of the remaining elements of the second query, max_single_blow is 0, max_effective_blow is negative infinity**
