Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least three elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`. If `d` > `h`, `max_effective_blow` is `max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged and `results` does not change.***
