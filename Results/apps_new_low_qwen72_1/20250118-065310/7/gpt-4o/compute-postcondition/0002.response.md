The provided code snippet processes the first query from the `queries` list. It extracts the number of pairs `n` and the target value `x` from the first element of the first query. It then extracts the pairs of integers `(d_i, h_i)` from the rest of the elements in the first query and stores them in the list `blows`. It initializes `max_single_blow` to 0 and `max_effective_blow` to negative infinity. 

Since the code does not modify `t`, `queries`, or `results` beyond the extraction, these variables remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `x`, `blows`, `max_single_blow`, and `max_effective_blow` are updated based on the first query.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, and `queries` must have at least one query, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, `max_single_blow` is 0, `max_effective_blow` is -inf**
