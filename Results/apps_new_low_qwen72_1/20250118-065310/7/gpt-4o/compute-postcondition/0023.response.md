Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, `queries` must have at least one query, `results` is [1] if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `results` is [additional_blows + 1] where `additional_blows` is calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow`, `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value of `d` from `blows`, and `max_effective_blow` is the maximum value of `d - h` where `d > h` in `blows`.**
