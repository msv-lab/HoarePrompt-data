The provided code snippet consists of two lines:
1. `results.append(1)` adds the value 1 to the `results` list.
2. `break` is used to exit a loop immediately, but since this code snippet is not within a loop, it would cause a `SyntaxError`.

However, assuming the context where this snippet is valid (i.e., within a loop), the `break` statement would terminate the loop after appending 1 to `results`. Since we are focusing on the combined effect of the lines and assuming a valid context, we can consider the impact of the `append` operation and ignore the `break` statement for the purpose of this analysis.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `queries` is a list of queries
- `results` is [1] if `d` ≥ `x`, otherwise `results` is []
- If `d` ≥ `x`, `results` is [1, 1]
- `n` is the first integer from the first query
- `x` is the second integer from the first query
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query
- `max_single_blow` is `d`
- `max_effective_blow` is `d - h` if `d > h`; otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains -inf
- `d` and `h` are the values of the next element in `blows`

After executing the code:
- The `results.append(1)` line adds another 1 to the `results` list.

If `d` ≥ `x` before the code execution, `results` was [1, 1]. After appending 1, `results` becomes [1, 1, 1].
If `d` < `x` before the code execution, `results` was []. After appending 1, `results` becomes [1].

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, queries is a list of queries, results is [1, 1, 1] if d ≥ x, otherwise results is [1], n is the first integer from the first query, x is the second integer from the first query, blows is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, max_single_blow is d, max_effective_blow is d - h if d > h; otherwise, max_effective_blow remains -inf, d and h are the values of the next element in blows**
