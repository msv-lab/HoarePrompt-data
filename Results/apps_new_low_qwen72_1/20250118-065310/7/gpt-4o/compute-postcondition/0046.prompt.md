Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, queries is a list of queries with at least two queries, results is not affected, n is the first integer from the second query, x is the second integer from the second query, blows is a list of the remaining elements of the second query, max_single_blow is 0, max_effective_blow is negative infinity
Code of the loop:
for d, h in blows:
    if d >= x:
        results.append(1)
        break
    max_single_blow = max(max_single_blow, d)
    if d > h:
        max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)
else:
    if max_effective_blow <= 0:
        results.append(-1)
    else:
        remaining_heads = x - max_single_blow
        additional_blows = (remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1
            ) // max_effective_blow
        results.append(additional_blows + 1)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`. If `d` > `h`, `max_effective_blow` is `d - h`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains negative infinity.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least two elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, if `d` ≥ `x`, `results` contains an additional 1 and may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d > h`. If `d` is not greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least three elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`. If `d` > `h`, `max_effective_blow` is `max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged and `results` does not change.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
