Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `d` ≥ `x`, `results` includes an additional 1. `n` is the first integer from the next query, `x` is the second integer from the next query, `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one more element, `d` and `h` are the values of the next tuple in the `blows` list, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`. If `d` > `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d` - `h`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged. `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`.***
