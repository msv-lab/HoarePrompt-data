The code snippet updates the value of `max_effective_blow` by taking the maximum between its current value and `d - h`. The impact of this code is as follows:

- `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.
- All other variables (`t`, `queries`, `n`, `x`, `blows`, `max_single_blow`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `max_effective_blow` was either negative infinity or `d - h` if `d > h`. After executing the code, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of these two values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least two elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, if `d` ≥ `x`, `results` contains an additional 1 and may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`.**
