The code snippet updates the value of `max_effective_blow` to the maximum of its current value and the difference between `d` and `h`. Since `d` is already known to be greater than `h`, the difference `d - h` is a positive value. This means `max_effective_blow` will be updated to at least this positive value if it was previously less than this value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x` and, if the condition `d >= x` is true, `results` includes an additional 1, `n` is the first integer from the next query, `x` is the second integer from the next query, `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one element, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and the value of `d`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`, `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`. Additionally, the current value of `d` is greater than `h`.**
