The only objects in the loop head are `d` and `h` from the tuple `(d, h)` in the list `blows`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `blows`. If `blows` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `blows` had at least one element, and `d` and `h` were the values of the first element in `blows`. For the loop to execute one more time, `blows` must have at least another element, and `d` and `h` will take the values of the next element in `blows`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries, `results` is [1] if `d` ≥ `x`, otherwise `results` is [], if `d` ≥ `x`, `results` is [1, 1], `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, `max_single_blow` is `d`, and `max_effective_blow` is `d - h` if `d > h`; otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains -inf, `d` and `h` are the values of the next element in `blows`**
