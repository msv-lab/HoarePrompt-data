The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `results.append(1)`
2. `break`

The first line appends the integer 1 to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial state of `results`, it will now contain one more element, which is 1.

The second line, `break`, is typically used to exit a loop prematurely. However, since this code snippet is not within a loop, the `break` statement would cause a `SyntaxError` if executed. For the purpose of this simulation, we will assume the `break` statement is ignored or part of a larger context that is not shown here, focusing on the valid operations.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries
- `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`
- `n` is the first integer from the next query
- `x` is the second integer from the next query
- `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one more element
- `d` and `h` are the values of the next tuple in the `blows` list
- `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`
- If `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - h`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged
- `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`

After executing the code snippet:
- `results` will have an additional 1 appended to it.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, queries is a list of queries with at least two queries, results contains 1 if any d in blows is greater than or equal to x and an additional 1, n is the first integer from the next query, x is the second integer from the next query, blows is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one more element, d and h are the values of the next tuple in the blows list, max_single_blow is the maximum of the previous max_single_blow and d, if d > h, max_effective_blow is updated to the maximum of its current value and d - h, otherwise max_effective_blow remains unchanged, query is the next query in the queries list, and the length of queries must be greater than the current index of query**
