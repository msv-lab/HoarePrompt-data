Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the result of each query from the `queries` list. Each result is determined based on the conditions: if there exists a `d` in the query's `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, the result is 1. Otherwise, if no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, the result is the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`. If no such `d` exists, the result is -1. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`.**
