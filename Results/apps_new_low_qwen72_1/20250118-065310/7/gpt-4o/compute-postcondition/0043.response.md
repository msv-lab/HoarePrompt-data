The value of `max_single_blow` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `d`. Since `d` is the third element in `blows`, and `blows` must have at least three elements, `d` is a valid integer. The value of `max_single_blow` before this operation is the maximum of 0 and `d` if `d` ≥ `x`. After the operation, `max_single_blow` will be the maximum of its previous value and `d`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least three elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` > `h`, `(d, h)` is the third element in `blows`, and if `d` is not greater than `x`, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged and `results` does not change.
