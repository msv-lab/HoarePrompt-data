Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least three elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d` if `d` ≥ `x`. If `d` ≥ `x`, `results` contains an additional 1 and `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` > `h`. If `d` is not greater than `x`, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged and `results` does not change. `(d, h)` is the third element in `blows`.***
