To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries.
- `results` is not affected.
- `n` is the first integer from the second query.
- `x` is the second integer from the second query.
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query.
- `max_single_blow` is 0.
- `max_effective_blow` is negative infinity.

The loop head is:
```
for (d, h) in blows:
```

For this loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must be true:
- `blows` must be a non-empty list. This is because the loop iterates over pairs `(d, h)` in `blows`, and if `blows` is empty, the loop will not execute even once.

Given the initial state, we know that `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query. Since `queries` has at least two queries and `blows` is derived from the second query, `blows` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state must be:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries.
- `results` is not affected.
- `n` is the first integer from the second query.
- `x` is the second integer from the second query.
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element.
- `max_single_blow` is 0.
- `max_effective_blow` is negative infinity.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` is not affected, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element, `max_single_blow` is 0, `max_effective_blow` is negative infinity**
