Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1 for each query where any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or the number of additional blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less if no `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. `n` is the first integer from the last processed query, `x` is the second integer from the last processed query, `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have been processed completely for each query, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value of `d` encountered across all queries, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum value of `d - h` encountered where `d` > `h` across all queries, `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`.**
