The value of `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is negative infinity) and the difference between `d` and `h`. Since `d` is greater than `h`, the difference `d - h` is a positive value, which will be greater than negative infinity. Therefore, `max_effective_blow` will be updated to `d - h`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is `d - h`, and the current value of `d` is greater than `h`.**
