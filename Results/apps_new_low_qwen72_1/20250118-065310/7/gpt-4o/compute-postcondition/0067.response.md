The code updates `max_effective_blow` to the maximum of its current value and the difference between `d` and `h`. We need to evaluate this expression and determine the new value of `max_effective_blow`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries
- `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `d` ≥ `x`, `results` includes an additional 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the next query
- `x` is the second integer from the next query
- `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one more element
- `d` and `h` are the values of the next tuple in the `blows` list
- `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`
- `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - h` if `d` > `h`. Otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged
- `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`

The code snippet:
```
max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)
```

Impact of the code:
- `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.

Since `d` and `h` are the values of the next tuple in the `blows` list, the new value of `max_effective_blow` will be:
- If `d > h`, then `max_effective_blow` will be the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.
- If `d <= h`, then `max_effective_blow` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `d` ≥ `x`, `results` includes an additional 1. `n` is the first integer from the next query, `x` is the second integer from the next query, `blows` is a list of tuples (each containing two elements) and must have at least one more element, `d` and `h` are the values of the next tuple in the `blows` list, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of its current value and `d - h`, `query` is the next query in the `queries` list, and the length of `queries` must be greater than the current index of `query`.**
