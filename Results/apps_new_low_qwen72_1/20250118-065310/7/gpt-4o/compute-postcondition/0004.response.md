Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, `queries` must have at least one query, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query and must have at least one pair of integers (d, h), `max_single_blow` is 0, `max_effective_blow` is -inf, and the current value of `d` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
