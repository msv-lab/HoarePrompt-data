The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(d, h)` and the list `blows`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `blows`. If `blows` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `blows` must have had at least two elements, and the tuple `(d, h)` was set to the values of the second element in `blows`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `blows` must have at least three elements, and the tuple `(d, h)` will be set to the values of the third element in `blows`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least three elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, if `d` ≥ `x`, `results` contains an additional 1 and may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d > h`. If `d` is not greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged. `(d, h)` is the third element in `blows`.**
