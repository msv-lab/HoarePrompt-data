The code updates the value of `max_effective_blow` to be the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.

- `max_effective_blow` is updated based on the condition `max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`.
- If `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` will be set to `d - h` if `d - h` is greater than the current value of `max_effective_blow`.
- If `d <= h`, `max_effective_blow` will remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `max_effective_blow` is initially `d - h` if `d > h`; otherwise, it is `-inf`.

Therefore, the new value of `max_effective_blow` will be:

- If `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` will be `d - h` (since `d - h` is already the maximum).
- If `d <= h`, `max_effective_blow` will remain `-inf`.

The other variables (`t`, `queries`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `blows`, `max_single_blow`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries, `results` is [1] if `d` ≥ `x`, otherwise `results` is [], if `d` ≥ `x`, `results` is [1, 1], `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, `max_single_blow` is `d`, `max_effective_blow` is `d - h` if `d > h`; otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains -inf**
