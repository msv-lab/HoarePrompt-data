The provided code snippet appends the value 1 to the list `results` and then breaks out of the loop. However, since there is no explicit loop shown in the snippet, the `break` statement might cause a syntax error if this code is executed in isolation. Assuming the context includes a loop (which is common for handling queries), the effect of the code is to add 1 to `results` and terminate further processing within that loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, `queries` must have at least one query
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is the first integer from the first query
- `x` is the second integer from the first query
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query and must have at least one pair of integers (d, h)
- `max_single_blow` is 0
- `max_effective_blow` is -inf
- the current value of `d` is greater than or equal to `x`

After executing the code:
- `results` now contains the value 1
- The `break` statement would typically terminate the loop, but since no loop is explicitly shown, we assume it affects the loop context.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, queries is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, queries must have at least one query, results is [1], n is the first integer from the first query, x is the second integer from the first query, blows is a list of the remaining elements of the first query and must have at least one pair of integers (d, h), max_single_blow is 0, max_effective_blow is -inf, and the current value of d is greater than or equal to x**
