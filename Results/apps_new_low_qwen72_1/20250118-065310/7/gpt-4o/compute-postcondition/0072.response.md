The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `queries`. `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, indicating the number of queries. `queries` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a single query and contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and `n` pairs of integers `(d_i, h_i)` (1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9). Each pair `(d_i, h_i)` represents the number of heads reduced and the number of heads grown for each blow type.

The function returns a list `results` of integers. The length of `results` is equal to the length of `queries`. For each query, the corresponding element in `results` is determined as follows:
- If there exists a `d` in the query's `blows` that is greater than or equal to `x`, the result is 1.
- If no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but there exists a `d` that is greater than `h`, the result is the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less, calculated as `(x - max_single_blow + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow + 1`.
- If no such `d` exists, the result is -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts `t` (an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and `queries` (a list of lists, each containing an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and `n` pairs of integers `(d_i, h_i)`). It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the result of each query. The result for each query is 1 if any `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, the minimum number of blows required to reduce `x` to 0 or less if no `d` is greater than or equal to `x` but some `d` is greater than `h`, or -1 if no such `d` exists.**
