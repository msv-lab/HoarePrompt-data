Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries, `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, `max_single_blow` is `max(d, d)`. If `d` > `h`, `max_effective_blow` is `max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`. If `d` ≥ `x`, `results` is [1, 1, 1]; otherwise, `results` is [1].***
