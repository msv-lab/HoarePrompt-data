Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` may contain 1 if any `d` in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value of `d` found in `blows` or 0 if no such value exists, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum value of `d - h` for all `d` > `h` in `blows` or negative infinity if no such value exists. If the loop completes without appending 1 to `results`, `results` will contain either -1 (if `max_effective_blow` ≤ 0) or the number of additional blows required to reduce `x` to zero using the most effective blow plus one.**
