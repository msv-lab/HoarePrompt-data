To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions that allow the loop to start. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for query in queries:
```

For this loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must be met:

1. The variable `queries` must be defined and must be an iterable.
2. The iterable `queries` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of queries.
- Each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), followed by n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9.
- `results` is an empty list.

We can infer that `queries` is a list of queries, and for the loop to execute, `queries` must have at least one query.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts must be adjusted to ensure that `queries` contains at least one query.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries where each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, and `queries` must have at least one query, `results` is an empty list.**
