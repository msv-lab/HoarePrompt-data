Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least two elements, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, if `d` ≥ `x`, `results` contains an additional 1 and may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `max_effective_blow` is the maximum of `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d > h`. If `d` is not greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` remains unchanged.***
