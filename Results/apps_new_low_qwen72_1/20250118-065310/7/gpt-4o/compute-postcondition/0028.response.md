The provided code snippet appends the value 1 to the list `results` and then uses the `break` statement, which typically exits a loop. However, since there is no loop explicitly shown in the given context, the `break` statement would raise a `SyntaxError` if this were the actual context. Assuming this is part of a larger code block where a loop exists, the `break` would terminate the loop immediately after appending 1 to `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries
- `results` is not affected
- `n` is the first integer from the second query
- `x` is the second integer from the second query
- `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element
- `max_single_blow` is 0
- `max_effective_blow` is negative infinity
- `d` is greater than or equal to `x`

After executing the code:
- The value 1 is appended to `results`.
- The `break` statement would exit the loop (assuming it's within a loop).

The final state, considering the loop context, would be:
Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` contains 1, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element, `max_single_blow` is 0, `max_effective_blow` is negative infinity, and `d` is greater than or equal to `x`**
