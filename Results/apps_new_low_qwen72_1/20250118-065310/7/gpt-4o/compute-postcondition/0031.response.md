Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries with at least two queries, `results` may contain 1 if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `n` is the first integer from the second query, `x` is the second integer from the second query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the second query and must have at least one element, `max_single_blow` is the maximum of 0 and `d`, and `max_effective_blow` is negative infinity. Additionally, the current value of `d` is greater than `h`.**
