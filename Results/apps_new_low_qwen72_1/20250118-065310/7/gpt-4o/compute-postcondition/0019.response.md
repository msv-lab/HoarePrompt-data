Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `queries` is a list of queries, `n` is the first integer from the first query, `x` is the second integer from the first query, `blows` is a list of the remaining elements of the first query, `max_single_blow` is `d`, and `max_effective_blow` is `d - h` if `d > h`; otherwise, `max_effective_blow` remains -inf, `d` and `h` are the values of the next element in `blows`. If `d` ≥ `x`, `results` is [1, 1, 1]; otherwise, `results` is [1].***
