t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of queries. queries is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), followed by a list of n tuples, each containing two integers d_i and h_i (1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9).
