t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of queries. Each query is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), followed by n pairs of integers (d_i, h_i) where 1 ≤ d_i, h_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of heads reduced and the number of heads grown for each blow type.
