Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The function correctly checks if `n` is 1 and prints `-1` if so, aligning with the problem's requirement that no Pythagorean triple exists for `n = 1`.

2. **Loop and Calculation**: The function iterates over possible values of `m` starting from `n` up to \(10^{18}\). For each `m`, it calculates `k` as \(\sqrt{m^2 - n^2}\). This is the correct formula to check if `m`, `n`, and `k` form a Pythagorean triple, where `k` must be an integer.

3. **Integer Check**: The condition `if k == int(k):` correctly checks if `k` is an integer. If `k` is an integer, it prints the pair `(m, int(k) + n)` and breaks out of the loop. This is correct because `int(k) + n` gives the third side of the triangle, ensuring that `n`, `m`, and `int(k) + n` form a Pythagorean triple.

4. **Range Consideration**: The loop runs up to \(10^{18}\), which is a very large number and ensures that the loop will find a valid `m` and `k` if they exist within the given constraints. However, this range is unnecessarily large and could be optimized. A more efficient approach would be to limit the range to a smaller but sufficient upper bound, but the current implementation is still correct.

5. **Output Handling**: The function prints the result directly to the console, which is consistent with the problem statement. If no valid `m` and `k` are found, the function implicitly prints `-1` by reaching the end of the loop without breaking.

Given these points, the function is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
