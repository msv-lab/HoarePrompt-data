Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.

For example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.

Here Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.

Katya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the length of some side of a right triangle.


-----Output-----

Print two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.

In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them.

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for m in range(n, int(1e+18) + 1):
            k = (m ** 2 - n ** 2) ** 0.5
            if k == int(k):
                print(m, int(k) + n)
                break
        else:
            print(-1)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and performs the following actions:

1. If `n` is 1, it prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, it searches for the smallest integer `m` starting from `n` up to 10^18 such that the expression `(m^2 - n^2)^0.5` results in an integer `k`. When such an `m` and `k` are found, it prints the tuple `(m, int(k) + n)` and exits the loop.
3. If no such `m` is found within the specified range, it prints `-1`.

The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that either a tuple `(m, int(k) + n)` has been printed, or `-1` has been printed, depending on the input `n` and the search for `m` and `k`.
