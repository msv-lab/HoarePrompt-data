Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.

For example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.

Here Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.

Katya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the length of some side of a right triangle.


-----Output-----

Print two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.

In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for m in range(n, int(1e+18) + 1):
            k = (m ** 2 - n ** 2) ** 0.5
            
            if k == int(k):
                print(m, int(k) + n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If an integer `k` is found, the loop prints `(m, int(k) + n)` and breaks. If no such `m` is found within the range, the loop prints `-1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 1, the function does nothing specific (assuming no action is taken in the if part). Otherwise, if an integer `k` is found, the loop prints `(m, int(k) + n)` and breaks. If no such `m` is found within the range, the loop prints `-1`.
