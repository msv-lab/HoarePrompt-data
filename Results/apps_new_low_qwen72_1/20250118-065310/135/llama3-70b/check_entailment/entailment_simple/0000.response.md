Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The function correctly reads an integer `n` from the input and checks if it is equal to 1. If `n` is 1, it prints `-1` because there is no Pythagorean triple where one of the sides is 1.

2. **Loop to Find Pythagorean Triple**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `m` starting from `n` up to \(10^{18}\).
   - For each `m`, it calculates `k` using the formula \( k = \sqrt{m^2 - n^2} \).
   - It checks if `k` is an integer by comparing `k` to `int(k)`. If `k` is an integer, it prints `(m, int(k) + n)` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Termination**:
   - If a valid `k` is found, the loop prints the result and exits.
   - If no valid `k` is found within the range, the loop will not print anything, which means the program will terminate without printing `-1` for cases where no valid triple exists.

However, there is a potential issue with the termination condition. If no valid `k` is found within the range, the program should explicitly print `-1` to indicate that no Pythagorean triple exists. This is not handled in the current code.

To fix this, we need to add a flag to check if a valid triple was found and print `-1` if it wasn't.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        found = False
        for m in range(n, int(1e18) + 1):
            k = (m ** 2 - n ** 2) ** 0.5
            if k == int(k):
                print(m, int(k) + n)
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            print(-1)
```

Given the original code, the correctness is **False** because it does not handle the case where no valid Pythagorean triple is found.

Correctness: **False**
