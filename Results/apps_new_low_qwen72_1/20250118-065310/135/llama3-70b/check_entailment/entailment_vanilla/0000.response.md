Reasoning:

The function `func()` aims to solve the problem of finding a Pythagorean triple that includes a given integer `n` as one of its sides. The solution involves checking if there exists an integer `m` such that \( m > n \) and a corresponding integer \( k \) where \( k = \sqrt{m^2 - n^2} \) is also an integer. If such `k` exists, it forms a Pythagorean triple with `n` and `m`.

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, the function correctly prints `-1` because 1 cannot be part of a Pythagorean triple (since \( 1^2 + 1^2 \neq c^2 \) for any integer \( c \)).
3. **Loop to Find `m` and `k`**:
   - The loop starts from `m = n` and iterates up to \( 10^{18} \).
   - For each `m`, it calculates \( k = \sqrt{m^2 - n^2} \).
   - If `k` is an integer (checked using `if k == int(k)`), it prints `m` and `int(k) + n` and breaks out of the loop.
4. **No Solution Found**: If the loop completes without finding a valid `k`, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The logic correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
  - The loop effectively checks for the existence of a Pythagorean triple by iterating through possible values of `m`.
  - The condition `if k == int(k)` ensures that `k` is an integer, which is necessary for a valid Pythagorean triple.
  - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Efficiency**: The current approach can be optimized. Instead of iterating up to \( 10^{18} \), we can use known properties of Pythagorean triples to find a solution more efficiently. For example, if `n` is even, we can use the formula \( (a, b, c) = (2mn, m^2 - n^2, m^2 + n^2) \) where \( m > n \). If `n` is odd, we can use \( (a, b, c) = (m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2) \).

However, despite potential inefficiencies, the given program does correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
