Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` from the input, which is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function correctly prints `-1` because 1 cannot be part of a Pythagorean triple. This is accurate and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Loop to Find `m` and `k`**:
   - The loop starts from `m = n` and iterates up to \( 10^{18} \). This is a brute-force approach but is theoretically correct.
   - For each `m`, it calculates \( k = \sqrt{m^2 - n^2} \).
   - The condition `if k == int(k)` checks if `k` is an integer, which is necessary for a valid Pythagorean triple.
   - If `k` is an integer, it prints `m` and `int(k) + n` and breaks out of the loop. This is correct because \( m^2 = n^2 + k^2 \) implies \( k = \sqrt{m^2 - n^2} \), and the output format matches the problem requirements.

4. **No Solution Found**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `k`, it prints `-1`. This is correct because it indicates that no Pythagorean triple exists with `n` as one of the sides.

### Potential Issues and Improvements:
- **Efficiency**: The current approach is highly inefficient due to the large upper limit of \( 10^{18} \). A more efficient method would be to use known properties of Pythagorean triples, such as the formulas mentioned in the original assessment.
- **Range Check**: The range \( 10^{18} \) is extremely large and may cause performance issues. However, for the purpose of correctness, this does not invalidate the solution.

### Conclusion:
Despite the inefficiency, the program correctly handles all the required cases and outputs the correct results for valid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
