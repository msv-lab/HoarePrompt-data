Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a fundamental issue with efficiency and the logic used to find the Pythagorean triple. The program iterates from `n` to `10^18` to find a valid `m` such that `k = (m^2 - n^2)^0.5` is an integer. This approach is inefficient and may not terminate within a reasonable time for large values of `n`.

Moreover, the logic for generating the Pythagorean triple is flawed. For a given `n`, the program should find `m` and `k` such that `n^2 + m^2 = k^2`. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates `k` as `sqrt(m^2 - n^2)` and then checks if `k` is an integer. This is not the correct way to generate a Pythagorean triple.

A more efficient and correct approach would be to use the properties of Pythagorean triples. For example, if `n` is odd, a Pythagorean triple can be generated as follows:
- Let `m = (n^2 - 1) / 2`
- Let `k = m + 1`

If `n` is even, a Pythagorean triple can be generated as follows:
- Let `m = (n/2)^2 - 1`
- Let `k = m + 2`

This approach ensures that the triple is valid and can be computed efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        if n % 2 == 1:  # n is odd
            m = (n * n - 1) // 2
            k = m + 1
        else:  # n is even
            m = (n // 2) ** 2 - 1
            k = m + 2
        print(m, k)

func()
```

This version of the program will correctly handle all valid inputs and generate the required Pythagorean triple efficiently.
