### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` from the input using `int(input())`.
   - This is correctly handled as per the problem description.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function prints `-1` because 1 cannot be part of a Pythagorean triple. This is correct as no Pythagorean triple includes 1 as one of its sides.
   - The edge case is handled correctly.

3. **Loop to Find `m` and `k`**:
   - The loop starts from `m = n` and iterates up to \( 10^{18} \).
   - For each `m`, it calculates \( k = \sqrt{m^2 - n^2} \).
   - The condition `if k == int(k)` checks if `k` is an integer.
   - If `k` is an integer, it prints `m` and `int(k) + n` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that `k` is an integer, forming a valid Pythagorean triple with `n` and `m`.

4. **No Solution Found**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `k`, it prints `-1`.
   - This is correct because it indicates that no Pythagorean triple exists with the given `n`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The logic correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
  - The loop effectively checks for the existence of a Pythagorean triple by iterating through possible values of `m`.
  - The condition `if k == int(k)` ensures that `k` is an integer, which is necessary for a valid Pythagorean triple.
  - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Efficiency**: The current approach can be optimized. Instead of iterating up to \( 10^{18} \), we can use known properties of Pythagorean triples to find a solution more efficiently. For example, if `n` is even, we can use the formula \( (a, b, c) = (2mn, m^2 - n^2, m^2 + n^2) \) where \( m > n \). If `n` is odd, we can use \( (a, b, c) = (m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2) \).

However, despite potential inefficiencies, the given program does correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies and prints a Pythagorean triple for the given input `n` or prints `-1` if no such triple exists.

Final: **True**
