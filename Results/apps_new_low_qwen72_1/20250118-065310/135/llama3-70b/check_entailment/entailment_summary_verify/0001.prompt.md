You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.

For example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.

Here Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.

Katya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the length of some side of a right triangle.


-----Output-----

Print two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.

In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for m in range(n, int(1e+18) + 1):
            k = (m ** 2 - n ** 2) ** 0.5
            if k == int(k):
                print(m, int(k) + n)
                break
        else:
            print(-1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and performs the following actions:

1. If `n` is 1, it prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, it searches for the smallest integer `m` starting from `n` up to 10^18 such that the expression `(m^2 - n^2)^0.5` results in an integer `k`. When such an `m` and `k` are found, it prints the tuple `(m, int(k) + n)` and exits the loop.
3. If no such `m` is found within the specified range, it prints `-1`.

The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that either a tuple `(m, int(k) + n)` has been printed, or `-1` has been printed, depending on the input `n` and the search for `m` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The function `func()` aims to solve the problem of finding a Pythagorean triple that includes a given integer `n` as one of its sides. The solution involves checking if there exists an integer `m` such that \( m > n \) and a corresponding integer \( k \) where \( k = \sqrt{m^2 - n^2} \) is also an integer. If such `k` exists, it forms a Pythagorean triple with `n` and `m`.

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, the function correctly prints `-1` because 1 cannot be part of a Pythagorean triple (since \( 1^2 + 1^2 \neq c^2 \) for any integer \( c \)).
3. **Loop to Find `m` and `k`**:
   - The loop starts from `m = n` and iterates up to \( 10^{18} \).
   - For each `m`, it calculates \( k = \sqrt{m^2 - n^2} \).
   - If `k` is an integer (checked using `if k == int(k)`), it prints `m` and `int(k) + n` and breaks out of the loop.
4. **No Solution Found**: If the loop completes without finding a valid `k`, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The logic correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
  - The loop effectively checks for the existence of a Pythagorean triple by iterating through possible values of `m`.
  - The condition `if k == int(k)` ensures that `k` is an integer, which is necessary for a valid Pythagorean triple.
  - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Efficiency**: The current approach can be optimized. Instead of iterating up to \( 10^{18} \), we can use known properties of Pythagorean triples to find a solution more efficiently. For example, if `n` is even, we can use the formula \( (a, b, c) = (2mn, m^2 - n^2, m^2 + n^2) \) where \( m > n \). If `n` is odd, we can use \( (a, b, c) = (m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2) \).

However, despite potential inefficiencies, the given program does correctly solve the problem as described.
