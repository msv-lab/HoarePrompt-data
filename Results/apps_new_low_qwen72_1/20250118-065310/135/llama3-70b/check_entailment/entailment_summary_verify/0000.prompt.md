You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.

For example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.

Here Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.

Katya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the length of some side of a right triangle.


-----Output-----

Print two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.

In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for m in range(n, int(1e+18) + 1):
            k = (m ** 2 - n ** 2) ** 0.5
            if k == int(k):
                print(m, int(k) + n)
                break
        else:
            print(-1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and performs the following actions:

1. If `n` is 1, it prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, it searches for the smallest integer `m` starting from `n` up to 10^18 such that the expression `(m^2 - n^2)^0.5` results in an integer `k`. When such an `m` and `k` are found, it prints the tuple `(m, int(k) + n)` and exits the loop.
3. If no such `m` is found within the specified range, it prints `-1`.

The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that either a tuple `(m, int(k) + n)` has been printed, or `-1` has been printed, depending on the input `n` and the search for `m` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a fundamental issue with efficiency and the logic used to find the Pythagorean triple. The program iterates from `n` to `10^18` to find a valid `m` such that `k = (m^2 - n^2)^0.5` is an integer. This approach is inefficient and may not terminate within a reasonable time for large values of `n`.

Moreover, the logic for generating the Pythagorean triple is flawed. For a given `n`, the program should find `m` and `k` such that `n^2 + m^2 = k^2`. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates `k` as `sqrt(m^2 - n^2)` and then checks if `k` is an integer. This is not the correct way to generate a Pythagorean triple.

A more efficient and correct approach would be to use the properties of Pythagorean triples. For example, if `n` is odd, a Pythagorean triple can be generated as follows:
- Let `m = (n^2 - 1) / 2`
- Let `k = m + 1`

If `n` is even, a Pythagorean triple can be generated as follows:
- Let `m = (n/2)^2 - 1`
- Let `k = m + 2`

This approach ensures that the triple is valid and can be computed efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        if n % 2 == 1:  # n is odd
            m = (n * n - 1) // 2
            k = m + 1
        else:  # n is even
            m = (n // 2) ** 2 - 1
            k = m + 2
        print(m, k)

func()
```

This version of the program will correctly handle all valid inputs and generate the required Pythagorean triple efficiently.
