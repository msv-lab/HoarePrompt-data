Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and performs the following actions:

1. If `n` is 1, it prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, it searches for the smallest integer `m` starting from `n` up to 10^18 such that the expression `(m^2 - n^2)^0.5` results in an integer `k`. When such an `m` and `k` are found, it prints the tuple `(m, int(k) + n)` and exits the loop.
3. If no such `m` is found within the specified range, it prints `-1`.

The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that either a tuple `(m, int(k) + n)` has been printed, or `-1` has been printed, depending on the input `n` and the search for `m` and `k`. **
