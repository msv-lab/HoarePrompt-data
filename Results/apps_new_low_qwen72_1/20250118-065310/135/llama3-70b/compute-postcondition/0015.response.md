The provided code snippet includes a print statement and a break statement. The print statement outputs the values of `m` and the sum of `int(k)` and `n`. The break statement is outside of a loop or switch-case structure and thus will cause a syntax error if executed in a standard Python script. However, since we are simulating the execution, we will consider the effects of the valid statements only.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `m` is `n + 2`.
- `k` is \(2\sqrt{n + 1}\).

The first line of the code prints the value of `m` and the sum of `int(k)` and `n`. The value of `m` is `n + 2`, and `int(k)` is the integer part of \(2\sqrt{n + 1}\). Therefore, the printed output is `m` and `int(k) + n`.

Since the break statement is invalid in this context, it does not affect the program's state. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged after the print statement.

Output State: **n is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and n is not equal to 1, m is n + 2, k is \(2\sqrt{n + 1}\)**

However, the output of the print statement would be:
- `m` (which is `n + 2`)
- `int(k) + n` (where `k` is \(2\sqrt{n + 1}\))

For example, if `n` is 3:
- `m` would be 5.
- `k` would be approximately 4.0, so `int(k)` is 4.
- The printed output would be `5 7`.

But since the question asks for the final state of the variables, the final state remains:
Output State: **n is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and n is not equal to 1, m is n + 2, k is \(2\sqrt{n + 1}\)**
