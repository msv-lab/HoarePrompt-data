Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 1, the function does nothing specific (assuming no action is taken in the if part). Otherwise, if an integer `k` is found, the loop prints `(m, int(k) + n)` and breaks. If no such `m` is found within the range, the loop prints `-1`.***
