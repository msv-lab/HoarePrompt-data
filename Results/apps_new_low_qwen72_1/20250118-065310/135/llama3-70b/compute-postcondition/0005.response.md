The value of `k` is calculated as the square root of the difference between the squares of `m` and `n`. Since `m` is equal to `n`, `m ** 2` is equal to `n ** 2`, making the expression `(m ** 2 - n ** 2)` equal to 0. Therefore, `k` is the square root of 0, which is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is not equal to 1, `m` is `n`, `k` is 0**
