The provided code snippet includes a `print` statement followed by a `break` statement. However, the `break` statement is outside of any loop or switch structure, which would normally cause a syntax error in Python. For the purpose of this task, I will assume that the `break` statement is ignored or commented out, allowing the code to execute up to the `print` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `m` is `n + 1`.
- `k` is \((2n + 1)\).

The code:
```
print(m, int(k) + n)
# break
```

### Analysis:
1. The `print` statement outputs the values of `m` and `int(k) + n`.
   - `m` is `n + 1`.
   - `k` is \((2n + 1)\).
   - `int(k)` is the integer value of \((2n + 1)\), which is already an integer since `n` is an integer.
   - Therefore, `int(k) + n` is \((2n + 1) + n = 3n + 1\).

2. The `break` statement is ignored or commented out, so it does not affect the execution.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `m` remains `n + 1`.
- `k` remains \((2n + 1)\).

The `print` statement outputs `m` and `3n + 1`.

Output State: **n is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and n is not equal to 1, m is \(n + 1\), k is \(2n + 1\)**

The print statement would output: **m is \(n + 1\), and 3n + 1**.
