The only variable in the loop head is `m`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m` relative to `n` and the upper limit `int(1e+18) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is not equal to 1, `m` is `n + 2`, `k` is \(2n + 1\)**
