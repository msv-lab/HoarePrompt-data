The code snippet assigns the average of `y1` and `y2` to the variable `y_goal_mid`. Given the constraints in the initial state, `y1` and `y2` are integers such that `y1 < y2`, and thus `(y1 + y2) / 2` will result in a float representing the midpoint between `y1` and `y2`.

Output State: **y1, y2, yw, xb, yb, r are integers such that 1 ≤ y1, y2, yw, xb, yb ≤ 10^6, y1 < y2 < yw, yb + r < yw, 2·r < y2 - y1, and (yb + r < yw and y1 < y2 and y1 + r < y2 - r), `y_goal_mid` is a float equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
