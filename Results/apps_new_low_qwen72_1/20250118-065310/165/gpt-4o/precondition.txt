y1, y2, yw, xb, yb, and r are integers such that 1 ≤ y1, y2, yw, xb, yb ≤ 10^6, y1 < y2 < yw, yb + r < yw, and 2·r < y2 - y1. The ball is positioned correctly in the field, does not cross any wall, and does not touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts are not located in the field corners.
