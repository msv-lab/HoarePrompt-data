### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The input is read and split into integers `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`.
   - The initial checks ensure that the conditions `1 ≤ y1, y2, yw, xb, yb ≤ 10^6`, `y1 < y2 < yw`, `yb + r < yw`, and `2·r < y2 - y1` are met. If any of these conditions fail, the program returns `-1`.

2. **Goal Midpoint Calculation:**
   - The midpoint of the goal is calculated as `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`.
   - Additional checks ensure that `y_goal_mid - r ≥ y1` and `y_goal_mid + r ≤ y2`. If either condition fails, the program returns `-1`.

3. **Aiming Point Calculation:**
   - The aiming point `x_w` is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     x_w = xb - 2 \times (yb - y_goal_mid) \times (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the geometric properties of the reflection off the wall and the requirement that the ball should bounce once and go into the goal.

4. **Final Check and Return:**
   - The program checks if `x_w` is less than or equal to 0. If so, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `x_w`.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula for `x_w` is derived from the geometry of the problem:
  - The ball is initially at `(xb, yb)`.
  - The goal midpoint is `y_goal_mid`.
  - The ball reflects off the wall at `yw` and should hit the goal between `(0, y1)` and `(0, y2)`.
  - The reflection point `x_w` is calculated such that the ball's trajectory after reflection will intersect the goal within the allowed range.

### Potential Issues:
- The formula for `x_w` is correct in theory, but the comment suggesting that `x_w` is always `3 * xb` is incorrect. This is a mistake in the comment, not in the actual calculation.
- The conditions and checks are comprehensive and cover all the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem statement accurately. The only issue is a misleading comment about the value of `x_w`, but this does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
