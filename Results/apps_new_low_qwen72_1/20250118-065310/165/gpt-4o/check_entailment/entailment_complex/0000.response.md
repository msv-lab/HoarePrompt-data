Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the optimal point \( x_w \) on the wall where Robo-Wallace should aim to score a goal. Let's break down the logic and verify each step:

1. **Initial Input Validation:**
   ```python
   if (yb + r >= yw or y1 >= y2 or y1 + r >= y2 - r) :
       return -1
   ```
   - This check ensures that:
     - The ball's center plus its radius is below the wall height (\( y_b + r < y_w \)).
     - The goal posts are correctly placed (\( y_1 < y_2 \)).
     - There is enough space for the ball to fit between the goal posts (\( 2 \cdot r < y_2 - y_1 \)).

2. **Calculate the Midpoint of the Goal:**
   ```python
   y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2
   if (y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2) :
       return -1
   ```
   - This calculates the midpoint of the goal posts and ensures that the ball can fit within the goal when centered at this midpoint.

3. **Calculate the Target Point \( x_w \):**
   ```python
   x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)
   if (x_w <= 0) :
       return -1
   ```
   - This formula calculates the point \( x_w \) on the wall where the ball should be aimed. The formula is derived from the geometric properties of the reflection and the straight-line path of the ball.
   - It checks if the calculated \( x_w \) is within the valid range (greater than 0).

4. **Return the Result:**
   ```python
   return x_w
   ```

### Verification of the Formula:
The formula for \( x_w \) is:
\[ x_w = x_b - 2 \cdot \frac{(y_b - y_{\text{goal\_mid}}) \cdot x_b}{y_{\text{goal\_mid}} - y_b} \]

This formula is derived from the principle of reflection. The term \( \frac{(y_b - y_{\text{goal\_mid}}) \cdot x_b}{y_{\text{goal\_mid}} - y_b} \) represents the horizontal distance adjustment needed due to the reflection. The factor of 2 accounts for the reflection itself.

### Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles cases where the ball cannot fit between the goal posts or the ball is too high to hit the wall.
- The function also ensures that the calculated \( x_w \) is positive, which is necessary for the ball to bounce off the wall and move towards the goal.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the optimal point \( x_w \) for Robo-Wallace to aim at, ensuring the ball bounces off the wall and scores a goal. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
