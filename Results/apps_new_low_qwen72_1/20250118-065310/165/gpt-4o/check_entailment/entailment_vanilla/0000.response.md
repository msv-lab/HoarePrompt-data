### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and split into individual integer components (`y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, `r`).

2. **Initial Validity Checks**:
   - **Ball Position Check**: The condition `yb + r >= yw` ensures that the ball is below the wall Robo-Wallace is aiming at.
   - **Goalpost Validity Check**: The conditions `y1 >= y2` and `y1 + r >= y2 - r` ensure that the goalposts are correctly placed and the ball can fit through the goal.

3. **Goal Midpoint Calculation**:
   - The midpoint of the goal is calculated as `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`.

4. **Goal Midpoint Validity Check**:
   - The condition `y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2` ensures that the midpoint of the goal is within the valid range for scoring.

5. **Aiming Point Calculation**:
   - The aiming point `x_w` is calculated using the formula `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`. This formula uses the properties of similar triangles to find the point on the wall where the ball should be aimed to bounce and enter the goal.

6. **Final Validity Check**:
   - The condition `x_w <= 0` ensures that the aiming point is within the valid range (i.e., to the right of the goal).

7. **Output**:
   - If any of the validity checks fail, the function returns `-1`.
   - If all checks pass, the function returns the calculated `x_w` with a precision of 10 decimal places.

### Correctness:
The program follows the logic described in the problem statement and performs the necessary calculations and checks to determine the correct aiming point. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
