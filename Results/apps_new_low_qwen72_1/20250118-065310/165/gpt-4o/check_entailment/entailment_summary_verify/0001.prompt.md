You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer — as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.

Your task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).

The football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] 

In the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 — the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} — the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} — the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r — the radius of the ball. 

A goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.


-----Input-----

The first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 ≤ y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} ≤ 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2·r < y_2 - y_1).

It is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.


-----Output-----

If Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print "-1" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number x_{w} — the abscissa of his point of aiming. 

If there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them. When checking the correctness of the answer, all comparisons are made with the permissible absolute error, equal to 10^{ - 8}. 

It is recommended to print as many characters after the decimal point as possible.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 10 13 10 3 1

Output
4.3750000000

Input
1 4 6 2 2 1

Output
-1

Input
3 10 15 17 9 2

Output
11.3333333333



-----Note-----

Note that in the first and third samples other correct values of abscissa x_{w} are also possible.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
y1 = int(data[0])
y2 = int(data[1])
yw = int(data[2])
xb = int(data[3])
yb = int(data[4])
r = int(data[5])
result = func_1(y1, y2, yw, xb, yb, r)
if result == -1:
    print(result)
else:
    print(f'{result:.10f}')

def func_1(y1, y2, yw, xb, yb, r):
    if yb + r >= yw or y1 >= y2 or y1 + r >= y2 - r:
        return -1
    y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2
    if y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2:
        return -1
    x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)
    if x_w <= 0:
        return -1
    return x_w



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts six integer parameters `y1`, `2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`. It checks several conditions and returns either `-1` or a calculated value `x_w`. Here's a summary of its behavior:

1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and split into individual integer components (`y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, `r`).

2. **Initial Validity Checks**:
   - **Ball Position Check**: The condition `yb + r >= yw` ensures that the ball is below the wall Robo-Wallace is aiming at.
   - **Goalpost Validity Check**: The conditions `y1 >= y2` and `y1 + r >= y2 - r` ensure that the goalposts are correctly placed and the ball can fit through the goal.

3. **Goal Midpoint Calculation**:
   - The midpoint of the goal is calculated as `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`.

4. **Goal Midpoint Validity Check**:
   - The condition `y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2` ensures that the midpoint of the goal is within the valid range for scoring.

5. **Aiming Point Calculation**:
   - The aiming point `x_w` is calculated using the formula `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`. This formula uses the properties of similar triangles to find the point on the wall where the ball should be aimed to bounce and enter the goal.

6. **Final Validity Check**:
   - The condition `x_w <= 0` ensures that the aiming point is within the valid range (i.e., to the right of the goal).

7. **Output**:
   - If any of the validity checks fail, the function returns `-1`.
   - If all checks pass, the function returns the calculated `x_w` with a precision of 10 decimal places.

### Correctness:
The program follows the logic described in the problem statement and performs the necessary calculations and checks to determine the correct aiming point. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
