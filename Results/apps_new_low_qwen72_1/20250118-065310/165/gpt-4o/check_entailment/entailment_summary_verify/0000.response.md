### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and function summary to evaluate its correctness:

1. **Initial Validations**:
   - The condition `yb + r >= yw` ensures that the ball is not too close to the wall. If it is, the ball cannot be aimed at the wall without touching it.
   - The conditions `y1 >= y2` and `y1 + r >= y2 - r` check if the goal posts are valid and if the ball can fit between them. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns `-1`.

2. **Goal Midpoint Calculation**:
   - The midpoint of the goal posts is calculated as `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`. This midpoint is used to determine the target point for the ball to reflect off the wall and go through the goal.

3. **Midpoint Validation**:
   - The program checks if the midpoint is within the valid range considering the ball's radius (`y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2`). If the midpoint is outside this range, it means the ball cannot fit through the goal posts, and the function returns `-1`.

4. **Reflection Calculation**:
   - The x-coordinate of the aiming point (`x_w`) is calculated using the formula `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`. This formula is derived from the reflection properties of the ball, ensuring that the ball will bounce off the wall and go towards the goal.

5. **Final Validation**:
   - The program checks if the calculated `x_w` is within the valid range (i.e., `x_w > 0`). If `x_w` is less than or equal to 0, it means the ball would hit the other wall or the goal post, so it returns `-1`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated `x_w` with high precision (10 decimal places) or `-1` if the goal cannot be scored.

### Evaluation:

- **Initial Validations**:
  - The conditions `yb + r >= yw`, `y1 >= y2`, and `y1 + r >= y2 - r` are correctly implemented and cover the necessary edge cases.

- **Goal Midpoint Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `y_goal_mid` is correct and aligns with the problem description.

- **Midpoint Validation**:
  - The validation `y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2` ensures that the ball can fit through the goal posts, which is a crucial check.

- **Reflection Calculation**:
  - The formula `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)` is derived correctly from the reflection properties of the ball. It ensures that the ball will bounce off the wall and go towards the goal.

- **Final Validation**:
  - The check `x_w > 0` ensures that the ball will not hit the other wall or the goal post, which is a necessary condition for a valid solution.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases as required by the problem description. The logic and calculations are sound and align with the problem requirements.

### Final:
**True**
