Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the optimal point on the wall where Robo-Wallace should aim to score a goal by bouncing the ball off the wall. The key steps and logic in the function `func_1` need to be analyzed for correctness:

1. **Initial Validation Checks**:
   - The program first checks if the ball is too close to the wall (`yb + r >= yw`). This ensures that the ball can actually bounce off the wall.
   - It also checks if the goal posts are valid (`y1 >= y2` or `y1 + r >= y2 - r`). These conditions ensure that the goal posts are properly placed and that the ball can fit through the goal.

2. **Goal Midpoint Calculation**:
   - The midpoint of the goal posts (`y_goal_mid`) is calculated as `(y1 + y2) / 2`. This midpoint is used to determine the direction and angle of the ball's bounce.

3. **Midpoint Validation**:
   - The program checks if the midpoint is within the valid range for the goal (`y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2`). This ensures that the ball can pass through the goal posts.

4. **Calculating the Aiming Point**:
   - The aiming point `x_w` is calculated using the formula `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`. This formula uses the principles of geometry and physics to determine the point on the wall where the ball should be aimed to bounce into the goal.

5. **Final Validation**:
   - The program checks if the calculated `x_w` is positive. If `x_w` is not positive, it means the ball would not bounce towards the goal, and the function returns `-1`.

Based on the problem description and the provided execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic and steps to solve the problem. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the requirements and constraints given in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
