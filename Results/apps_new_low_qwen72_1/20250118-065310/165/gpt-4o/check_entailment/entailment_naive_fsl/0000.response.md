Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program follows the problem description and handles all the conditions and edge cases as required:

1. **Initial Validations**: The function `func_1` checks if the ball is too close to the wall (`yb + r >= yw`) or if the goal posts are invalid (`y1 >= y2` or `y1 + r >= y2 - r`). If any of these conditions are true, it returns `-1`.

2. **Goal Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint of the goal posts is calculated as `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`. This midpoint is used to ensure the ball will reflect off the wall and go through the goal.

3. **Midpoint Validation**: The program checks if the midpoint is within the valid range considering the ball's radius (`y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2`). If not, it returns `-1`.

4. **Reflection Calculation**: The x-coordinate of the aiming point (`x_w`) is calculated using the formula derived from the reflection properties of the ball. The formula ensures that the ball will bounce off the wall and go towards the goal.

5. **Final Validation**: The program checks if the calculated `x_w` is within the valid range (i.e., `x_w > 0`). If `x_w` is less than or equal to 0, it means the ball would hit the other wall or the goal post, so it returns `-1`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the calculated `x_w` with high precision (10 decimal places) or `-1` if the goal cannot be scored.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
