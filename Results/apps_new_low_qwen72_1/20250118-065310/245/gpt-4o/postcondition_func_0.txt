The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `x` from the user, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 2`. It then simulates a series of position swaps based on the parity of `n` and the initial value of `x`. The final position is printed to the console. Specifically, if `n` is odd, the final position will be 1 if `x` is 0, 0 if `x` is 1, and 2 if `x` is 2. If `n` is even, the final position will be 0 if `x` is 0, 2 if `x` is 1, and 1 if `x` is 2. The function does not return any value; it only prints the final position to the console.
