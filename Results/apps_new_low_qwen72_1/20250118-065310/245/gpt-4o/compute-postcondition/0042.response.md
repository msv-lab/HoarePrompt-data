Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `x` from the user, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 2`. It then simulates a series of position swaps based on the parity of `n` and the initial value of `x`. The final position is printed to the console. Specifically, if `n` is odd, the final position will be 1 if `x` is 0, 0 if `x` is 1, and 2 if `x` is 2. If `n` is even, the final position will be 0 if `x` is 0, 2 if `x` is 1, and 1 if `x` is 2. The function does not return any value; it only prints the final position to the console. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Input Validation:** The function does not validate the input to ensure that `n` and `x` fall within the specified ranges (`1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 2`). If invalid inputs are provided, the behavior of the function is undefined.
- **Initial Position Handling:** The initial position `x` can be 0, 1, or 2. The function correctly handles these cases based on the parity of `n`.
- **Parity of `n`:** The function correctly handles both even and odd values of `n`, updating the position accordingly.
- **No Return Value:** The function does not return any value; it only prints the final position. This means that the caller cannot use the result in further computations without capturing the output manually.
