The code snippet assigns the value 2 to the variable `position`. This overrides the previous value of `position` which was determined based on the value of `x` and the parity of `i - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, `position` is 2, `i` is `i - 1`**
