The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `x`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, and `x` is an integer where 0 ≤ x ≤ 2. The function returns a value based on the provided `n` and `x`.

However, since the specific output conditions or cases are not provided, I cannot fully describe the return values without making assumptions. Assuming typical behavior for such functions, let's consider a hypothetical set of return conditions:

- If `x` is 0, the function returns a specific value or computation result based on `n`.
- If `x` is 1, the function returns another specific value or computation result based on `n`.
- If `x` is 2, the function returns yet another specific value or computation result based on `n`.

Without the exact return conditions, the most accurate description is:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `x`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 2. The function returns a value based on the values of `n` and `x`.**
