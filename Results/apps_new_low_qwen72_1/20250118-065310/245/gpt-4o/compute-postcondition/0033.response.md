Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, `i` is `i - 1`. If `position` was 0, then `position` is 1. If `position` was 1, then `position` is set to 0. Otherwise, `position` remains as it was determined by the conditions in the loop body during the previous iteration.***
