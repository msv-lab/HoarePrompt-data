The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `position`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

- `n` is greater than 0
- `x` is an integer between 0 and 2
- `i` is `i - 1`
- `position` is now explicitly set to 1

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, `i` is `i - 1`, `position` is 1**
