The value of `position` is set to 1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, and `i` is `i - 1` from its previous value, all remain valid. The `position` is now explicitly set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, `i` is `i - 1`, `position` is 1.**
