The provided code snippet takes two inputs and assigns them to `n` and `x`, respectively. It then assigns the value of `x` to a new variable `position`.

- The first line reads an integer input and assigns it to `n`.
- The second line reads another integer input and assigns it to `x`.
- The third line assigns the value of `x` to `position`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, the final state will reflect the updated values of `n`, `x`, and `position` based on the inputs.

Output State: **n is an integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9), x is an integer input by the user (0 ≤ x ≤ 2), position is equal to the value of x**
