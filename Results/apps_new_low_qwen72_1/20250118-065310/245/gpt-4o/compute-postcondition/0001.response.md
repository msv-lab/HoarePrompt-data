To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9)
- `x` is an integer input by the user (0 ≤ x ≤ 2)
- `position` is equal to the value of `x`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop uses the `range` function with three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`.
- In this case, `start` is `n`, `stop` is `0`, and `step` is `-1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (`n`) must be greater than the stopping value (`0`).

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`x` and `position`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the initial state.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is an integer between 0 and 2.
- `position` is equal to the value of `x`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `x` and `position` do not affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the initial state.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, `position` is equal to the value of `x`**
