The code snippet sets the variable `position` to 0. This overrides any previous value that `position` might have had. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, `i` is `i - 1`, `position` is 0.**
