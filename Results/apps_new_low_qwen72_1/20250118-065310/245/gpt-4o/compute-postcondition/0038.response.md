Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, and `i` is `i - 1`. If `i % 2 == 1`, then if `position` was 0, `position` is now 1; if `position` was 1, `position` is now 0; otherwise, `position` remains unchanged. If `i % 2 == 0`, then if `position` was 1, `position` is now 2; if `position` was 2, `position` is now 1; otherwise, `position` remains unchanged.***
