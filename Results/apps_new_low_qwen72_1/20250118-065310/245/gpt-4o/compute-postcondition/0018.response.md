Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, and `position` is initially equal to the value of `x`. If `i % 2 == 1`, and `position` is 0, then `position` is set to 1; if `position` is 1, then `position` is set to 0; if `position` is 2, then `position` remains unchanged. If `i % 2 == 0`, and `position` is 1, then `position` is set to 2; if `position` is 2, then `position` is set to 1; if `position` is 0, then `position` remains 0.***
