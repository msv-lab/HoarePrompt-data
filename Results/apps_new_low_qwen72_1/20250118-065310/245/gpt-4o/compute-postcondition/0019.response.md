The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `n`. The loop decrements `i` from `n` down to 1 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the sequence.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `x` is an integer between 0 and 2
- `position` is determined based on the value of `x` and the parity of `i`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be decreased by 1, as the loop is iterating in reverse order from `n` down to 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change during the loop execution.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can assume it was some value `k` where `1 < k <= n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, `position` is determined based on the value of `x` and the parity of `i - 1`, `i` is `i - 1`**
