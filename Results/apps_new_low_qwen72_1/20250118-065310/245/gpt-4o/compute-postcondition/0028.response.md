Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2, and `i` is `i - 1`. If `i % 2 == 1`, then if `position` is 0, `position` is set to 1; if `position` is 1, `position` is set to 0; if `position` is neither 0 nor 1, `position` remains unchanged. If `i % 2 == 0`, then if `position` is 1, `position` is updated to 2; if `position` is 2, `position` is updated to 1.***
