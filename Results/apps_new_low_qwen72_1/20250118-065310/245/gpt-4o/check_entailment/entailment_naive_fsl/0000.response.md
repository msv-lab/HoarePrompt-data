Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the issue arises when the ball is initially under the right shell (position 2). The logic in the program incorrectly swaps positions for the right shell, leading to incorrect results. Hereâ€™s a specific case where the program fails:

- **Input**: `n = 1`, `x = 2`
- **Expected Output**: `1`
- **Actual Output**: `2`

In this case, the ball starts under the right shell (position 2). After one move, the operator swaps the middle shell (position 1) with the right shell (position 2). Therefore, the ball should move to position 1. However, the program incorrectly keeps the ball at position 2. This indicates a logical error in the handling of the right shell.
