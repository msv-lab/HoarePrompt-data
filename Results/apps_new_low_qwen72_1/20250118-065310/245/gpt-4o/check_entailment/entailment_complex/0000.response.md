Reasoning:  
The program aims to simulate the reverse of the shell game based on the rules provided. The logic inside the loop correctly handles the swapping according to the move's parity (odd or even). However, there is a logical issue in the placement of the `for` loop and the handling of the `position` variable. The `for` loop should be inside the `func` function, and the `input()` calls should also be within the function to ensure they are executed when the function is called. Additionally, the logic for swapping during even moves is incomplete, as it only handles the case when `position` is 1 or 2, but not when `position` is 0.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = int(input())

    position = x
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            if position == 0:
                position = 1
            elif position == 1:
                position = 0
        else:
            if position == 1:
                position = 2
            elif position == 2:
                position = 1
        
    print(position)
```

With this correction, the function `func` correctly reads the inputs, simulates the reverse shell game, and prints the initial position of the ball.

Given the original program, the placement of the `for` loop and the handling of the `position` variable outside the function leads to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
