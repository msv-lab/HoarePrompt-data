You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bomboslav likes to look out of the window in his room and watch lads outside playing famous shell game. The game is played by two persons: operator and player. Operator takes three similar opaque shells and places a ball beneath one of them. Then he shuffles the shells by swapping some pairs and the player has to guess the current position of the ball.

Bomboslav noticed that guys are not very inventive, so the operator always swaps the left shell with the middle one during odd moves (first, third, fifth, etc.) and always swaps the middle shell with the right one during even moves (second, fourth, etc.).

Let's number shells from 0 to 2 from left to right. Thus the left shell is assigned number 0, the middle shell is 1 and the right shell is 2. Bomboslav has missed the moment when the ball was placed beneath the shell, but he knows that exactly n movements were made by the operator and the ball was under shell x at the end. Now he wonders, what was the initial position of the ball?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of movements made by the operator.

The second line contains a single integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) — the index of the shell where the ball was found after n movements.


-----Output-----

Print one integer from 0 to 2 — the index of the shell where the ball was initially placed.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
2

Output
1

Input
1
1

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the ball was initially placed beneath the middle shell and the operator completed four movements.  During the first move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell. The ball is now under the left shell.  During the second move operator swapped the middle shell and the right one. The ball is still under the left shell.  During the third move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell again. The ball is again in the middle.  Finally, the operators swapped the middle shell and the right shell. The ball is now beneath the right shell.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = int(input())
    position = x
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            if position == 0:
                position = 1
            elif position == 1:
                position = 0
        elif position == 1:
            position = 2
        elif position == 2:
            position = 1
    print(position)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `x` from the user, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 2`. It then simulates a series of position swaps based on the parity of `n` and the initial value of `x`. The final position is printed to the console. Specifically, if `n` is odd, the final position will be 1 if `x` is 0, 0 if `x` is 1, and 2 if `x` is 2. If `n` is even, the final position will be 0 if `x` is 0, 2 if `x` is 1, and 1 if `x` is 2. The function does not return any value; it only prints the final position to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to simulate the reverse process of the shell game described. It starts with the final position of the ball (`x`) and works backward through each move to determine the initial position. The logic inside the loop checks whether the move number `i` is odd or even and adjusts the position accordingly. However, there is a flaw in the handling of the even moves: the conditions for updating the position when `i` is even do not correctly account for all possible positions. Specifically, the program only updates the position if it is 1 or 2, but it does not handle the case where the position is 0. This can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the even moves correctly swap the middle and right shells, regardless of the current position of the ball.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = int(input())
    position = x
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            if position == 0:
                position = 1
            elif position == 1:
                position = 0
        else:
            if position == 1:
                position = 2
            elif position == 2:
                position = 1
    print(position)
```

Given the original program, the reasoning above shows that it does not handle the even moves correctly, leading to potential incorrect outputs. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
