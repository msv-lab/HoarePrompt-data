Reasoning:

The program aims to parse an input string that contains lowercase Latin letters and two special characters: `?` (candy cane) and `*` (snowflake). The goal is to construct a message of length `k` based on the rules provided for these special characters. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input string `s` and the integer `k`.

2. **Processing Characters**:
   - It iterates through the string `s`.
   - When it encounters an alphabetic character, it appends it to the list `ans`.
   - If the next character is a `?` (candy cane), it skips the current character and moves to the next one.
   - If the next character is a `*` (snowflake), it repeats the current character until there are no more `*` characters following it.

3. **Checking Length**:
   - After processing the string, it checks if the length of `ans` is equal to `k`.
   - If so, it prints the constructed message.
   - If not, it prints "Impossible".

**Issues and Edge Cases**:
- The program correctly handles the basic cases where the input string can be parsed to form a message of length `k`.
- However, there are a few edge cases to consider:
  - **Exceeding Length**: If the program constructs a message longer than `k` due to repeated characters, it should truncate the message to length `k`. This is not explicitly handled in the program.
  - **Insufficient Characters**: If the input string does not contain enough characters to form a message of length `k`, the program correctly prints "Impossible".
  - **Multiple Snowflakes**: The program correctly handles multiple consecutive snowflakes (`*`), but it should ensure that it does not exceed the length `k` during this process.

Given the provided examples and the logic, the program appears to handle the basic requirements and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
