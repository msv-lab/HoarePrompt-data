Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the string can encode a message of length `k` but requires more than one repetition of a letter due to the presence of multiple consecutive snowflakes (`*`). The program only appends the letter once for each snowflake, which may not be sufficient to reach the required length `k`.

Example Input:
```
a*a*a*
4
```
Expected Output:
```
aaaa
```
Actual Output:
```
Impossible
```
In this case, the string `a*a*a*` can encode the message `aaaa` by repeating the letter `a` four times, but the program incorrectly outputs `Impossible` because it does not handle multiple consecutive snowflakes correctly.
