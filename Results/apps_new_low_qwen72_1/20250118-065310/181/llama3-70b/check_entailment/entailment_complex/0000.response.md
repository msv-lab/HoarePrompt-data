Reasoning:  
The program is designed to parse an input string `s` that contains lowercase letters and two special characters: `*` (snowflake) and `?` (candy cane). The goal is to construct a message of length `k` based on the rules for handling these special characters. Here's a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` and the integer `k`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the characters of the resulting message.
   - It also initializes an index `i` to iterate through the string `s`.

3. **Processing the String**:
   - The program enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and the length of `ans` is less than `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is an alphabetic character:
     - If it is, the character is appended to `ans`.
     - If the next character is `?`, it skips the current character (candy cane rule).
     - If the next character is `*`, it repeats the current character in `ans` until there are no more `*` characters following it (snowflake rule).
   - If the current character is not an alphabetic character, it simply increments `i`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the length of `ans` is exactly `k`.
   - If it is, it prints the joined characters in `ans`.
   - If it is not, it prints 'Impossible'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the input string does not contain enough alphabetic characters to form a message of length `k`.
   - It correctly processes the special characters `*` and `?` according to the given rules.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for constructing the message based on the given rules and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
