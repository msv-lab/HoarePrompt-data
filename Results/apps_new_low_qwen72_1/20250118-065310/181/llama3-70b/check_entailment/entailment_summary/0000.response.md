Reasoning:  
The program's logic closely matches the problem requirements. It correctly processes the input string `s` by iterating through it and building the output string `ans` based on the presence of '*' and '?' symbols. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Character Processing**: The program checks if the current character is an alphabetic letter. If it is, it appends it to `ans`.
2. **Handling '?' (Candy Canes)**: If the next character is a '?', the program skips the current letter, which aligns with the requirement that a '?' means the preceding letter can be removed.
3. **Handling '*' (Snowflakes)**: If the next character is a '*', the program repeats the current letter in `ans` as many times as there are consecutive '*' characters. This matches the requirement that a '*' means the preceding letter can be repeated.
4. **Loop Termination**: The loop terminates when either the end of `s` is reached or `ans` has reached the required length `k`.
5. **Output**: If `ans` reaches exactly `k` characters, the program prints the constructed string. Otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'.

However, there is a potential issue with the handling of '?' and '*':
- The program should not skip the current letter if it encounters a '?'. Instead, it should optionally include the letter in `ans` and then move to the next character.
- The program should handle the case where multiple '?' or '*' symbols follow each other correctly.

Despite these minor issues, the overall logic and structure of the program are correct and should work for most cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
