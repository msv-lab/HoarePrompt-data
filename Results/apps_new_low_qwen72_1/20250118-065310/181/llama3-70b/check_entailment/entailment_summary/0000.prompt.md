Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Andrey received a postcard from Irina. It contained only the words "Hello, Andrey!", and a strange string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, snowflakes and candy canes. Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.

Andrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.

For example, consider the following string:  [Image] 

This string can encode the message «happynewyear». For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows:   candy cane 1: remove the letter w,  snowflake 1: repeat the letter p twice,  candy cane 2: leave the letter n,  snowflake 2: remove the letter w,  snowflake 3: leave the letter e. 

 [Image] 

Please note that the same string can encode different messages. For example, the string above can encode «hayewyar», «happpppynewwwwwyear», and other messages.

Andrey knows that messages from Irina usually have a length of $k$ letters. Help him to find out if a given string can encode a message of $k$ letters, and if so, give an example of such a message.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the string received in the postcard. The string consists only of lowercase Latin letters, as well as the characters «*» and «?», meaning snowflake and candy cone, respectively. These characters can only appear immediately after the letter. The length of the string does not exceed $200$.

The second line contains an integer number $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 200$), the required message length.


-----Output-----

Print any message of length $k$ that the given string can encode, or «Impossible» if such a message does not exist.

# Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    k = int(input())
    ans = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
        if s[i].isalpha():
            ans.append(s[i])
            if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '?':
                i += 2
            elif i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                    ans.append(s[i])
                    i += 2
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    if len(ans) == k:
        print(''.join(ans))
    else:
        print('Impossible')





# Execution Summary:
The function reads an input string `s` and an integer `k`. It processes the string `s` to construct a new string `ans` by including alphabetic characters from `s`. If an alphabetic character is followed by a '*', the character is repeated in `ans` until no more '*' characters follow. If an alphabetic character is followed by a '?', the character is skipped. The process continues until `ans` contains `k` characters or there are no more characters to process in `s`. If `ans` reaches exactly `k` characters, the function prints the constructed string `ans`. If `ans` cannot reach `k` characters due to insufficient alphabetic characters in `s`, the function prints 'Impossible'. The final state of the program is that `s` remains unchanged, `k` is still an integer between 1 and 200, and `ans` is a list containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, or fewer if `s` does not have enough alphabetic characters. The index `i` is either the length of `s` or the point where the loop condition `len(ans) < k` was no longer satisfied.
