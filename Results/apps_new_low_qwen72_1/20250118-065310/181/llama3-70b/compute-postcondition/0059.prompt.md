Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the special characters «*» and «?», k is an integer between 1 and 200, ans is an empty list, i is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
    if s[i].isalpha():
        ans.append(s[i])
        if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '?':
            i += 2
        elif i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
            while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                ans.append(s[i])
                i += 2
            i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, and `i` is 0 or 1. If `s[i]` is an alphabetic character, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `s` and the character at index `i + 1` is '?', then `i` is set to 2. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `s` and the character at index `i + 1` is '*', then `ans` is updated to contain the first character of `s` repeated for every pair of characters in `s` where the second character of each pair is '*', `i` is incremented by 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character if it exists. If no more pairs of characters exist where the second character is '*', the loop does not execute further. If neither of these conditions is met, `i` is set to 1, and the character at the current index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character. Additionally, either `i + 1` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, or the character at index `i + 1` of `s` is not equal to '?'. If `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character, `ans` remains an empty list, `i` is set to 1, and the character at index `i-1` in `s` is not an alphabetic character.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, and `len(ans)` is less than `k`. If `s[i].isalpha()`, `ans` contains one more element. If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '?'`, then `i` is incremented by 2, and `ans` contains the element `s[i-2]`. If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, then `i` is the last valid index before the loop condition fails + 1, and the loop terminates when `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, and `ans` contains the characters `s[i-1]` appended in each iteration. If `s[i-1]` is not an alphabetic character, `s` remains unchanged, and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `len(ans)` is less than `k`. If `s[i].isalpha()`, then `ans` is updated as follows: if `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '?'`, `ans` contains the character `s[i-2]` appended to its previous content; if `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '?'`, `ans` contains the character `s[i-1]` appended to its previous content; if `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, `i` is the final value such that `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`, and `ans` contains the characters `s[i - 2n]` for each `n` where `s[i - 1 - 2n]` is '*', appended to its previous content, and `s[i - 1]` is not '*', with `i` incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character, `i` is incremented by 1 and `s[i-1]` is not an alphabetic character.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
