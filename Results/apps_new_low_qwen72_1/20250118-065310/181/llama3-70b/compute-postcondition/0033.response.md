The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The loop condition is checked against this new value of `i`. The other variables (`s`, `k`, `len(ans)`, and `ans`) remain unchanged unless the new value of `i` causes the loop to terminate.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is the last valid index before the loop condition fails + 1, `len(ans)` is the initial length of `ans` plus the number of times the loop executed, `ans` contains the characters `s[i-1]` appended in each iteration, and the loop terminates when `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'**.
