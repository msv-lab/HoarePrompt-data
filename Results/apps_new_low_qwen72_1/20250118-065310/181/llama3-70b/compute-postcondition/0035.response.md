The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was originally less than the length of `s`, after incrementing, `i` is now equal to its previous value plus 1. The conditions about `s`, `k`, `len(ans)`, and the content of `ans` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `i + 1` being greater than or equal to the length of `s` or `s[i + 1]` not equal to `'*'` is also still valid, but now `i` itself is the value that was previously `i + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains one more element, which is `s[i-1]`. Either `i` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, or `s[i]` is not equal to `'*'`.**
