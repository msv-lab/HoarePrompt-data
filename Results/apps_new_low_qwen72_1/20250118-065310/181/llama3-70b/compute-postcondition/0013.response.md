The code snippet appends the character at index `i` (which is initially 5) of the string `s` to the list `ans`. Then, it increments the value of `i` by 2, making `i` equal to 7. The initial state includes that `s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 6, and the character at index 6 of `s` is '*'. Therefore, the character at index 5 of `s` is appended to `ans`, and `i` is updated to 7.

Output State: **s is a non-empty string with a length greater than 6, k is an integer between 1 and 200, ans is a list containing the first character of s twice followed by the character at index 3 of s and the character at index 5 of s, i is 7, and the character at index 6 of s is '*' if it exists**
