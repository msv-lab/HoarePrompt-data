The provided code appends the character at position `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans` and then increments `i` by 2. Let's analyze the final state after executing this code block:

- Initially, `ans` contains `[s[i - 4], s[i - 4], s[i - 2]]`.
- The first line `ans.append(s[i])` adds the character at position `i` in `s` to the end of `ans`.
- The second line `i += 2` increments `i` by 2.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200 (though it is not used in the code).
- `i` is such that `i + 5 < len(s)`, meaning `i` is within bounds for accessing `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]`.
- `len(ans)` is 3, and `ans` contains `[s[i - 4], s[i - 4], s[i - 2]]`.
- `s[i - 1]` is `'*'`.
- `s[i + 1]` is `'*'`.

After executing the code:
- `ans` will now contain `[s[i - 4], s[i - 4], s[i - 2], s[i]]`.
- `i` will be incremented by 2, so the new value of `i` is `i + 2`.

The final state is:
Output State: **s is a non-empty string, k is an integer between 1 and 200, i is i + 6, len(ans) is 4, ans contains [s[i - 6], s[i - 6], s[i - 4], s[i - 2]], s[i - 3] is '*', s[i + 1] is '*'**
