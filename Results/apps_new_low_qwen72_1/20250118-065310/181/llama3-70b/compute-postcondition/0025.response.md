The value of `i` is incremented by 2. All other conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than the length of `s` and has been incremented by 2, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains one more element, which is `s[i-2]`.**
