Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, and `len(ans)` is less than `k`. If `s[i].isalpha()`, `ans` contains one more element. If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '?'`, then `i` is incremented by 2, and `ans` contains the element `s[i-2]`. If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, then `i` is the last valid index before the loop condition fails + 1, and the loop terminates when `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, and `ans` contains the characters `s[i-1]` appended in each iteration. If `s[i-1]` is not an alphabetic character, `s` remains unchanged, and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`.***
