The code `print(''.join(ans))` concatenates the elements of the list `ans` into a single string and prints it. This operation does not modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. The state of the variables remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing the concatenated string.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is equal to the length of `s` or the loop condition `len(ans) < k` is no longer satisfied, `ans` is a list containing exactly `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, with any characters followed by '?' skipped over, and any characters followed by '*' repeated until no more '*' characters follow. The variable `i` is the index just past the last character processed in `s`, or it is the length of `s` if the entire string has been processed.**
