The provided code snippet modifies the variables `ans` and `i`. Initially, `s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is `i + 4`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains the characters `s[i - 4]` and `s[i - 2]` appended to its previous content, `s[i - 3]` is '*', `s[i - 1]` is a valid character, `i + 1 < len(s)`, and `s[i + 1]` is an asterisk (`'*'`).

The first line of the code appends the character at position `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans`. The second line increments `i` by 2.

Given these conditions and the code execution:
- The character at `s[i]` is appended to `ans`.
- `i` is incremented by 2.

The final state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is `i + 6`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains the characters `s[i - 6]`, `s[i - 4]`, `s[i - 2]`, and `s[i - 8]` appended to its previous content, `s[i - 7]` is '*', `s[i - 3]` is a valid character, `i + 1 < len(s)`, and `s[i + 1]` is an asterisk (`'*'`)**.
