To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i + 1 < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must still be less than the length of `s`.

2. **Condition 2: `s[i + 1] == '*'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at position `i + 1` in the string `s` is an asterisk (`*`).
   - For the loop to execute again, the character at position `i + 1` must still be an asterisk.

### Current State:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200.
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `len(ans)` is less than `k`.
- `ans` contains the character `s[i - 2]` appended to its previous content.
- `s[i - 1]` is `'*'`.
- `s[i]` is a valid character.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` needs to be incremented by 2 for the next iteration, but this is already part of the state.
- The string `s` must remain such that `i + 1` is still less than its length and `s[i + 1]` is still an asterisk.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is already incremented by 2, no further adjustment is needed for `i`.
- The string `s` must remain unchanged to ensure that `i + 1` is still within bounds and `s[i + 1]` is still an asterisk.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is `i + 2`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains the character `s[i - 2]` appended to its previous content, `s[i - 1]` is `'*'`, and `s[i]` is a valid character**.
