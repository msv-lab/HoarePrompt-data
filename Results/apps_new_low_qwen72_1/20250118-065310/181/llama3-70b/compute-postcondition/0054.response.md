Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, and `ans` contains the character `s[i-1]` appended to its previous content if `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`. If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, `i` is the final value such that `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`, and `ans` contains the characters `s[i - 2n]` for each `n` where `s[i - 1 - 2n]` is '*', appended to its previous content, and `s[i - 1]` is not '*', with `i` incremented by 1.***
