The provided code snippet appends the character at position `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans` and then increments `i` by 2. Given the initial state, let's determine the final state after executing this code.

- Initially, `s` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, but it is not used in the code snippet.
- `i` is `i + 2`, implying `i` was already incremented by 2 before the code snippet starts.
- `len(ans)` is 2, meaning `ans` initially contains two elements, both of which are `s[i - 2]`.
- `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk ('*').

Let's break down the execution:

1. `ans.append(s[i])`: This line appends the character at index `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains two elements (both `s[i - 2]`), after this line, `ans` will contain three elements: `[s[i - 2], s[i - 2], s[i]]`.

2. `i += 2`: This line increments `i` by 2. If `i` was previously `i + 2`, it now becomes `i + 4`.

Since `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk ('*'), the character at `s[i]` can be any valid character in the string `s`.

Combining these changes, the final state is:

Output State: **s is a non-empty string, k is an integer between 1 and 200, i is i + 4, len(ans) is 3, ans contains [s[i - 4], s[i - 4], s[i - 2]], s[i - 1] is '*'**
