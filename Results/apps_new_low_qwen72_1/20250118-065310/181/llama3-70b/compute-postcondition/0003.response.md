The code snippet `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is 0, meaning the first character of `s` is appended to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- The character at the current index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200
- `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`
- `i` is 0
- The character at the current index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, `i` is 0, and the character at the current index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character**
