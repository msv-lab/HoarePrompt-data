The provided code appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans` and then increments `i` by 2. Initially, `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `ans` contains the first character of `s` twice, `i` is 3, and the character at index 4 of `s` is `'*'` if it exists.

After executing the code:
- The character at index 3 of `s` is appended to `ans`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 2, making it 5.

The final state is:
Output State: **s is a non-empty string with a length of at least 5, k is an integer between 1 and 200, ans is a list containing the first character of s twice followed by the character at index 3 of s, i is 5, and the character at index 4 of s is '*' if it exists**
