The code snippet `print('Impossible')` simply prints the string 'Impossible' to the console and does not alter any variables or conditions in the current state. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is equal to the length of `s` or the loop condition `len(ans) < k` is no longer satisfied, `ans` is a list containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, with any characters followed by '?' skipped over, and any characters followed by '*' repeated until no more '*' characters follow. If `s` does not contain enough alphabetic characters to fill `ans` to length `k`, `ans` will contain fewer than `k` elements. The variable `i` is the index just past the last character processed in `s`, or it is the length of `s` if the entire string has been processed. Additionally, the length of `ans` is less than `k`.**
