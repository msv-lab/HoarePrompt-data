The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown except that it was less than the length of `s`. The conditions regarding `s`, `k`, and `len(ans)` remain unchanged. Since `i` is now incremented by 1, it is still less than the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than the length of `s` (incremented by 1), and `len(ans)` is less than `k`. Additionally, `s[i-1]` is not an alphabetic character.**
