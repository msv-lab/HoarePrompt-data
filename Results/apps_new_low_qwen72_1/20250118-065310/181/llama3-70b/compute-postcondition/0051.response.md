The value of `i` is incremented by 1. This affects the condition `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is the final value such that `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains the characters `s[i - 2n]` for each `n` where `s[i - 1 - 2n]` is '*', appended to its previous content, and `s[i - 1]` is not '*', `i` is incremented by 1.**
