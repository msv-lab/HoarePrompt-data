To determine the output state after all executions of the given loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and track the changes in variables through each iteration. Let's break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop is defined as:
```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    ans.append(s[i])
    i += 2
```
- **Initial State**: 
  - `s` is a non-empty string.
  - `k` is an integer between 1 and 200.
  - `i` is an index such that `i < len(s)`.
  - `len(ans)` is less than `k`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Variables that change**:
  - `i` increases by 2 in each iteration.
  - `ans` grows by appending `s[i]` in each iteration.
- **Variables that remain constant**:
  - `s` (the string remains unchanged).
  - `k` (the integer limit for the length of `ans`).

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.
- **Iteration Effect**:
  - In each iteration, `ans` appends `s[i]`.
  - `i` is incremented by 2.
- **Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when either `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- **After the loop executes**:
  - `i` will be the final value after the last increment.
  - `ans` will contain the characters `s[i]` appended in each iteration.
  - The length of `ans` will be the number of times the loop executed plus the initial length of `ans`.

### Final Output State
- **Final Values**:
  - `i` will be the last valid index before the loop condition fails.
  - `len(ans)` will be the initial length of `ans` plus the number of times the loop executed.
  - `ans` will contain the characters `s[i]` appended in each iteration.
- **Conditions**:
  - The loop stops when `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is the last valid index before the loop condition fails, `len(ans)` is the initial length of `ans` plus the number of times the loop executed, `ans` contains the characters `s[i]` appended in each iteration, and the loop terminates when `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`.**
