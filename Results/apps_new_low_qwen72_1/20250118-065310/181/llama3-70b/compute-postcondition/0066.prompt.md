You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and the special characters «*» and «?», where «*» represents a snowflake and «?» represents a candy cane. These special characters can only appear immediately after a letter. The length of the input string is at most 200. The integer k satisfies 1 ≤ k ≤ 200.
def func():
    s = input()

k = int(input())

ans = []

i = 0
    while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
        if s[i].isalpha():
            ans.append(s[i])
            if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '?':
                i += 2
            elif i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                    ans.append(s[i])
                    i += 2
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop has completed all executions: `s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is equal to the length of `s` or the loop condition `len(ans) < k` is no longer satisfied. `ans` is a list containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, with any characters followed by '?' skipped over, and any characters followed by '*' repeated until no more '*' characters follow. If `s` does not contain enough alphabetic characters to fill `ans` to length `k`, `ans` will contain fewer than `k` elements. The variable `i` is the index just past the last character processed in `s`, or it is the length of `s` if the entire string has been processed.
    if (len(ans) == k) :
        print(''.join(ans))
    else :
        print('Impossible')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is equal to the length of `s` or the loop condition `len(ans) < k` is no longer satisfied. `ans` is a list containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, with any characters followed by '?' skipped over, and any characters followed by '*' repeated until no more '*' characters follow. If `len(ans) == k`, `ans` contains exactly `k` alphabetic characters. If `len(ans) < k`, `ans` contains fewer than `k` elements because `s` does not contain enough alphabetic characters to fill `ans` to length `k`. The variable `i` is the index just past the last character processed in `s`, or it is the length of `s` if the entire string has been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `input_str` and an integer `k`. It returns a modified version of `input_str` based on the value of `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
