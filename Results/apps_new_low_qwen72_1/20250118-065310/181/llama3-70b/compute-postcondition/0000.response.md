The provided code snippet initializes a few variables based on the input and sets up the environment for further processing. Let's break down the overall effect of the code without detailing each line individually:

- `s` is set to the input string, which is expected to consist of lowercase Latin letters and the special characters «*» (snowflake) and «?» (candy cane), where these special characters can only appear immediately after a letter. The length of `s` is at most 200.
- `k` is set to an integer value provided by the user, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 200.
- `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
- `i` is initialized to 0, which will likely be used as an index for iterating through the string `s`.

Combining these effects, the final state of the program after executing the provided code block is:

Output State: **s is the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the special characters «*» and «?», k is an integer between 1 and 200, ans is an empty list, i is 0**
