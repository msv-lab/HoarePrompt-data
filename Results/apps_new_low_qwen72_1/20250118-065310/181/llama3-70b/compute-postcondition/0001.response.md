To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. **Condition 1**: `i < len(s)`
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute, `len(s)` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `s` must be a non-empty string).

2. **Condition 2**: `len(ans) < k`
   - Before the loop starts, `ans` is an empty list, so `len(ans)` is 0. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the special characters «*» and «?».
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `s` must be a non-empty string (i.e., `len(s) > 0`).
- `k` must be greater than 0 (which is already given as it is between 1 and 200).

Therefore, the modified state to ensure the loop executes at least once is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
