To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i + 1 < len(s)`**
   - This condition checks if there is at least one more character in the string `s` after the current index `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` is 6.
   - For the loop to execute again, `len(s)` must be greater than 6.

2. **Condition 2: `s[i + 1] == '*'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at index `i + 1` (which is 6 in this case) is an asterisk (`'*'`).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the character at index 4 of `s` is `'*'` if it exists, but we need to check the character at index 6.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`len(s)`**: To ensure `i + 1 < len(s)`, `len(s)` must be greater than 6.
- **`s[6]`**: To ensure `s[i + 1] == '*'`, the character at index 6 of `s` must be `'*'`.

### Final State:

Since the only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are those related to the conditions, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 6 and `s[6]` is `'*'`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 6, k is an integer between 1 and 200, ans is a list containing the first character of s twice followed by the character at index 3 of s, i is 5, and the character at index 6 of s is '*' if it exists**
