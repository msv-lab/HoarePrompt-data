The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`s`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Since `i` was the last even index processed where `s[i+1] == '*'`, and now it is incremented by 1, it moves to the next index. The new value of `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s` repeated for every pair of characters in `s` where the second character of each pair is '*', `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character if it exists. If no more pairs of characters exist where the second character is '*', the loop does not execute further.**
