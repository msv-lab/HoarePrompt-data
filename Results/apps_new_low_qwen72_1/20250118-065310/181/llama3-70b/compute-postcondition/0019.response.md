Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `s` and the character at index `i + 1` is '?', then `i` is set to 2 and the character at the current index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character. Otherwise, if `i + 1` is less than the length of `s` and the character at index `i + 1` is '*', then `ans` is updated to contain the first character of `s` repeated for every pair of characters in `s` where the second character of each pair is '*', `i` is incremented by 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character if it exists. If no more pairs of characters exist where the second character is '*', the loop does not execute further. If neither of these conditions is met, `i` is set to 1, and the character at the current index `i` of `s` is an alphabetic character. Additionally, either `i + 1` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, or the character at index `i + 1` of `s` is not equal to '?'.***
