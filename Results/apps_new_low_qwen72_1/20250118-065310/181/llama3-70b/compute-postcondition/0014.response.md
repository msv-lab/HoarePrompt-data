Output State: **s is a non-empty string, k is an integer between 1 and 200, ans is a list containing the first character of s repeated for every pair of characters in s where the second character of each pair is '*', i is the last even index processed (i.e., the largest even index such that s[i+1] == '*'), and the character at index i of s is an alphabetic character if it exists. If no more pairs of characters exist where the second character is '*', the loop does not execute further.**
