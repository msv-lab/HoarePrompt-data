To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i + 1 < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that the index `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
   - For this condition to be true, `i` must be less than `len(s) - 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `s[i + 1] == '*'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at index `i + 1` in the string `s` is an asterisk (`'*'`).
   - For this condition to be true, the character at index `i + 1` must be an asterisk.

### Given State:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200.
- `i` is less than the length of `s`.
- `len(ans)` is less than `k`.
- `ans` contains one more element, which is `s[i]`.

### Required Adjustments:
- **Condition 1**: Since `i` is already less than the length of `s`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(s) - 1` for the loop to execute.
- **Condition 2**: We need to ensure that the character at index `i + 1` in the string `s` is an asterisk (`'*'`).

### Final State:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200.
- `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`.
- `len(ans)` is less than `k`.
- `ans` contains one more element, which is `s[i]`.
- `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk (`'*'`).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains one more element, which is `s[i]`, and `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk (`'*'`).**
