The code snippet `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is less than the length of `s`, this operation is valid and does not raise an error. The length of `ans` increases by 1, but it remains less than `k` because the initial condition stated that `len(ans)` is less than `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains one more element, which is `s[i]`.**
