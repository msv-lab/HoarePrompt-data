The character at index `i` of the string `s` is appended to the list `ans`. Since `i` is less than the length of `s`, the operation is valid. The length of `ans` is now one more than its previous length, but it remains less than `k` because `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, and `len(ans)` was initially less than `k`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains the character `s[i]` appended to its previous content.**
