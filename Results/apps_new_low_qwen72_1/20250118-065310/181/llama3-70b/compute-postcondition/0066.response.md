Functionality: ** The function reads an input string `s` and an integer `k`. It processes the string `s` to construct a new string `ans` by including alphabetic characters from `s`. If an alphabetic character is followed by a '*', the character is repeated in `ans` until no more '*' characters follow. If an alphabetic character is followed by a '?', the character is skipped. The process continues until `ans` contains `k` characters or there are no more characters to process in `s`. If `ans` reaches exactly `k` characters, the function prints the constructed string `ans`. If `ans` cannot reach `k` characters due to insufficient alphabetic characters in `s`, the function prints 'Impossible'. The final state of the program is that `s` remains unchanged, `k` is still an integer between 1 and 200, and `ans` is a list containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, or fewer if `s` does not have enough alphabetic characters. The index `i` is either the length of `s` or the point where the loop condition `len(ans) < k` was no longer satisfied. **

Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- If `s` contains no alphabetic characters, the function will always print 'Impossible'.
- If `s` contains only special characters ('*' or '?') without any alphabetic characters, the function will also print 'Impossible'.
- If `k` is 1 and `s` contains a single alphabetic character followed by '*', the function will correctly handle the repetition and print the character.
- If `s` contains multiple consecutive '*' characters after an alphabetic character, the function will repeat the character for each '*' until no more '*' characters follow.
- If `s` contains an alphabetic character followed by a '?', the character will be skipped, and the next character in `s` will be processed.
- If `s` is empty, the function will read an empty string and print 'Impossible' since no alphabetic characters are available.
