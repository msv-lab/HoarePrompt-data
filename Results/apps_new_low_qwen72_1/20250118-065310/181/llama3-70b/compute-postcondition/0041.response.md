To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```python
while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i` is less than the length of `s`.
2. The length of `ans` is less than `k`.

Given the current state:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 200.
- `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`.
- `len(ans)` is less than `k`.

We need to ensure that both conditions remain true for the next iteration.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < len(s)`**
   - If `i` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can potentially continue.
   - To ensure this condition holds for the next iteration, `i` should be less than `len(s)`.

2. **Condition 2: `len(ans) < k`**
   - If `len(ans)` is less than `k`, the loop can potentially continue.
   - To ensure this condition holds for the next iteration, `len(ans)` should be less than `k`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `i` is already less than or equal to the length of `s`, we need to ensure that `i` is strictly less than `len(s)` for the next iteration.
- Since `len(ans)` is already less than `k`, we need to ensure that `len(ans)` remains less than `k` for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain:
- `i` is less than the length of `s`.
- `len(ans)` is less than `k`.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `len(ans)` is less than `k`.**
