Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `len(ans)` is less than `k`, `ans` contains one more element, which is `s[i]`. If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, then `i` is the last valid index before the loop condition fails + 1, and the loop terminates when `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, and `ans` contains the characters `s[i-1]` appended in each iteration.***
