You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output
30000

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    x = 10 ** k
    while n % x != 0:
        n += 1
    print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It then calculates the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to `n`. The function prints this calculated value and does not return any value. After the function executes, `n` is the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, and `k` and `x` retain their values as read from the input and computed, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the k-rounding of a given positive integer \( n \). Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, which are the required inputs as per the problem description.

2. **Initial Calculation**: It calculates \( x \) as \( 10^k \), which represents the number of trailing zeros needed.

3. **Loop to Find k-Rounding**: The program uses a while loop to increment \( n \) until \( n \) is divisible by \( x \). This ensures that the resulting number \( n \) ends with at least \( k \) zeros and is divisible by the original \( n \).

4. **Output**: Once the condition \( n \% x == 0 \) is met, the program prints the value of \( n \), which is the k-rounded number.

The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description correctly:
- For \( n = 375 \) and \( k = 4 \), the output is \( 30000 \).
- For \( n = 10000 \) and \( k = 1 \), the output is \( 10000 \).
- For \( n = 38101 \) and \( k = 0 \), the output is \( 38101 \).
- For \( n = 123456789 \) and \( k = 8 \), the output is \( 12345678900000000 \).

Given these points, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases and examples, and thus, it is correct.
