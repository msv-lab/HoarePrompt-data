You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    x = 10 ** k
    while n % x != 0:
        n += 1
    print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

x = 10 ** k
    while n % x != 0:
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `k` is the integer value read from input, `x` is \(10^k\) where `k` is the integer value read from input.
    print(n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It then calculates the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to `n`. The function prints this calculated value and does not return any value. After the function executes, `n` is the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, and `k` and `x` retain their values as read from the input and computed, respectively.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the smallest number `x` that ends with `k` or more zeros and is divisible by `n`. The approach taken in the program is to start with `10^k` and increment `n` until it becomes divisible by `10^k`. However, this approach is inefficient and may not work for large values of `n` because it could take a very long time to reach the correct value by incrementing `n` one by one.

A more efficient approach would be to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `n` and `10^k`, which directly gives the smallest number that is both divisible by `n` and ends with `k` zeros.

However, despite the inefficiency, the logic in the given program is technically correct for the problem statement, as it will eventually find the correct answer for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).

Correctness: **True** 

(Note: While the program is correct, it is not the most efficient solution.)
