The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Initially, `n` is the integer value read from input plus 1. After the increment, `n` becomes the integer value read from input plus 2. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from input plus 2, `k` is the integer value read from input, `x` is \(10^k\) where `k` is the integer value read from input**
