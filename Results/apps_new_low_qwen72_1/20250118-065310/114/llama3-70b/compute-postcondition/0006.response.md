The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` was initially the integer value read from input plus 2, after the increment, `n` will be the integer value read from input plus 3. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from input plus 3, `k` is the integer value read from input, `x` is \(10^k\)**
