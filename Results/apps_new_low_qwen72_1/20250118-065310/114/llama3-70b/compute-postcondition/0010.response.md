Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It then calculates the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to `n`. The function prints this calculated value and does not return any value. After the function executes, `n` is the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, and `k` and `x` retain their values as read from the input and computed, respectively. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input values are out of the specified ranges (e.g., `n` is less than 1 or greater than 10^9, or `k` is negative or greater than 8), the function does not handle these cases and may produce unexpected results.
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. If the caller expects a return value, they will need to capture the printed output separately.
- The function assumes that the input is always valid and does not include any error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect number of inputs).
