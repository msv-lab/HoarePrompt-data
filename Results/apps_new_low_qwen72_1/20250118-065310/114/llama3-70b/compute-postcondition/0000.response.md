The provided code reads two integers from the input, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. It then calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8. After executing the code, `n` and `k` take the values provided by the input, and `x` is computed based on the new value of `k`.

Output State: **n is the integer value read from input, k is the integer value read from input, x is 10^k where k is the integer value read from input**
