The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It then calculates the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to `n`. The function prints this calculated value and does not return any value. After the function executes, `n` is the smallest multiple of \(10^k\) that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, and `k` and `x` retain their values as read from the input and computed, respectively.
