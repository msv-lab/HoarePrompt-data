Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input as specified. It reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. This matches the problem description.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until the list `a` has only one element.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the minimum value in `a` is 0. If so, it removes the first occurrence of 0 from the list. This is correct because removing a 0 does not change the game state.
   - If the minimum value is not 0, it subtracts this minimum value from all elements in the list. This simulates the second action in the game rules where all elements are decreased by the same amount.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop, the list `a` should contain a single element. This element is the result of repeatedly applying the game actions.
   - The program then checks if the list `a` is not empty and prints 'BitLGM' if the remaining element is even, otherwise 'BitAryo'. This is based on the observation that the parity of the remaining element determines the winner.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list `a` becomes empty during the loop (which should not happen with valid inputs), the program correctly prints 'BitAryo'.
   - If all elements in the list are 0 initially, the program will remove all 0s and end up with an empty list, which again results in printing 'BitAryo'.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic of the program ensures that both players play optimally by always reducing the list to its simplest form, which is the GCD of the original non-zero elements or 0 if all elements were zero.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the game logic and determine the winner based on the parity of the final element.

Correctness: **True**
