Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 300.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [(i - x) for i in a]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `a` is a list of 1 integer where 0 ≤ a_i < 300. The final list `a` contains the GCD of the original elements if they were not all zeros, or it contains `[0]` if the original list was all zeros.
    if a :
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else :
        print('BitAryo')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `a` is a list of 1 integer where 0 ≤ a_i < 300. If `a` is not empty and `a[0]` is not zero, the output is 'BitLGM' if `a[0]` is even, or 'BitAryo' if `a[0]` is odd. If `a` is empty or all elements are zero, the final list `a` contains `[0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_i < 300). It then processes the list `a` to reduce it to a single element. This element is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original non-zero elements of the list, or 0 if all elements were zero. After processing, the function prints 'BitLGM' if the final element is even, or 'BitAryo' if the final element is odd. If the list becomes empty during processing, the function prints 'BitAryo'. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and `a` is a list containing a single integer (either the GCD of the original non-zero elements or 0), and the output is either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo' based on the parity of this final element.
