You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 1

Output
BitLGM

Input
2
1 2

Output
BitAryo

Input
3
1 2 1

Output
BitLGM

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [i - x for i in a]
    if a:
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else:
        print('BitAryo')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_i < 300). It then processes the list `a` to reduce it to a single element. This element is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original non-zero elements of the list, or 0 if all elements were zero. After processing, the function prints 'BitLGM' if the final element is even, or 'BitAryo' if the final element is odd. If the list becomes empty during processing, the function prints 'BitAryo'. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and `a` is a list containing a single integer (either the GCD of the original non-zero elements or 0), and the output is either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo' based on the parity of this final element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a flaw in its logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the minimum value in the list `a` is 0 but there are other non-zero values present. In such a scenario, the game should continue because the player can still choose a non-zero value and decrease it. However, the current implementation removes the zero and continues, which can lead to incorrect outcomes.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 0 2
```
The correct output should be "BitAryo" because BitLGM would have no valid move after BitAryo's first move (BitAryo could reduce the 2 to 1, leaving BitLGM with `[1, 0, 1]`, and then BitLGM cannot make a move that doesn't result in a loss). However, the given program incorrectly outputs "BitLGM" because it prematurely removes the 0 from the list and continues the game incorrectly.
