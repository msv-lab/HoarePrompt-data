You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 1

Output
BitLGM

Input
2
1 2

Output
BitAryo

Input
3
1 2 1

Output
BitLGM

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [i - x for i in a]
    if a:
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else:
        print('BitAryo')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_i < 300). It then processes the list `a` to reduce it to a single element. This element is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original non-zero elements of the list, or 0 if all elements were zero. After processing, the function prints 'BitLGM' if the final element is even, or 'BitAryo' if the final element is odd. If the list becomes empty during processing, the function prints 'BitAryo'. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and `a` is a list containing a single integer (either the GCD of the original non-zero elements or 0), and the output is either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo' based on the parity of this final element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The problem involves a two-player game where each player can either decrease a chosen integer in the sequence by any positive value up to itself or decrease all integers in the sequence by the same positive value, which is at most the minimum value in the sequence. The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which occurs when all integers are zero.

The provided solution attempts to simulate the game by repeatedly applying the optimal moves until only one number remains or the sequence becomes empty. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function reads the number of integers `n` and the sequence `a`.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - If the minimum value in the sequence is 0, it removes the first occurrence of 0 from the sequence.
   - Otherwise, it decreases all elements in the sequence by the minimum value in the sequence.

3. **Determine the Winner**:
   - If the sequence is not empty after the loop, the winner is determined by checking if the remaining single element is even or odd.
   - If the sequence is empty, BitAryo wins by default because BitLGM would have made the last possible move, leaving BitAryo with no move to make.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic:
- The game should consider the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves made, as this will determine the winner. The current implementation does not explicitly track the number of moves, but instead relies on the final state of the sequence to determine the winner.

To verify correctness, let's analyze the examples provided:

### Example 1:
- Input: `2\n1 1`
- Steps:
  - Both values are 1, so they can be reduced to 0 in one move.
  - The sequence becomes `[0, 0]`.
  - Since the sequence is not empty, the final value is 0 (even), so BitLGM wins.
- Output: `BitLGM` (Correct)

### Example 2:
- Input: `2\n1 2`
- Steps:
  - The minimum value is 1, so reduce both values by 1: `[0, 1]`.
  - Remove the 0: `[1]`.
  - The sequence has one element, which is 1 (odd), so BitAryo wins.
- Output: `BitAryo` (Correct)

### Example 3:
- Input: `3\n1 2 1`
- Steps:
  - The minimum value is 1, so reduce all values by 1: `[0, 1, 0]`.
  - Remove the 0s: `[1]`.
  - The sequence has one element, which is 1 (odd), so BitAryo wins.
- Output: `BitLGM` (Incorrect, should be `BitAryo`)

The provided solution incorrectly determines the winner in some cases due to the logic of determining the winner based on the final state of the sequence rather than the parity of the number of moves.
