You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----

1 1

Output

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [i - x for i in a]
    if a:
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else:
        print('BitAryo')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 300.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [(i - x) for i in a]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `a` is a list of 1 integer where 0 ≤ a_i < 300. The final list `a` contains the GCD of the original elements if they were not all zeros, or it contains `[0]` if the original list was all zeros.
    if a :
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else :
        print('BitAryo')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `a` is a list of 1 integer where 0 ≤ a_i < 300. If `a` is not empty and `a[0]` is not zero, the output is 'BitLGM' if `a[0]` is even, or 'BitAryo' if `a[0]` is odd. If `a` is empty or all elements are zero, the final list `a` contains `[0]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a flaw in its logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the minimum value in the list `a` is 0 but there are other non-zero values present. In such a scenario, the game should continue because the player can still choose a non-zero value and decrease it. However, the current implementation removes the zero and continues, which can lead to incorrect outcomes.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 0 2
```
The correct output should be "BitAryo" because BitLGM would have no valid move after BitAryo's first move (BitAryo could reduce the 2 to 1, leaving BitLGM with `[1, 0, 1]`, and then BitLGM cannot make a move that doesn't result in a loss). However, the given program incorrectly outputs "BitLGM" because it prematurely removes the 0 from the list and continues the game incorrectly.
