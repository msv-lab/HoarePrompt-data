The provided code snippet reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The first line reads an integer value for `n` which specifies the number of elements in the list `a`. The second line reads a space-separated string, converts it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to `a`.

Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is less than 300. The code will overwrite the existing value of `n` with the new input and redefine `a` based on the new input values.

Output State: **n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 (input value), a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 300 (input values)**
