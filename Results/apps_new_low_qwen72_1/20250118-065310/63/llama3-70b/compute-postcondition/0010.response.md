Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 300, and `a` has at least 2 elements. If the minimum value in `a` is 0, the first occurrence of 0 is removed from `a`. Otherwise, each element in `a` is the original element minus the minimum value of the original list `a`, which is now greater than or equal to 0.***
