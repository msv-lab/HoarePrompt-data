To determine if the loop will execute the first time, we need to consider the condition in the `while` loop head: `len(a) > 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 300\).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if the length of the list `a` is greater than 1.

3. **Evaluating the Condition**:
   - Since `n` is between 1 and 3, the length of `a` can be 1, 2, or 3.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - If `n` is 1, then `len(a)` will be 1, and the loop will not execute.
   - If `n` is 2 or 3, then `len(a)` will be 2 or 3, respectively, and the loop will execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be either 2 or 3. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect this.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 300**
