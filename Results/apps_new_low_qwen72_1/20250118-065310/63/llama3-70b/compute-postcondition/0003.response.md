The code `a.remove(0)` removes the first occurrence of the integer `0` from the list `a`. Given that the minimum value in the list `a` is `0`, this operation is valid and will modify the list `a`.

- `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3.
- `a` is now a list of `n-1` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 300, since one element (which was `0`) has been removed.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3, `a` is a list of `n-1` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 300**.
