Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `a` is a list of 1 integer where 0 ≤ a_i < 300. The final list `a` contains the GCD of the original elements if they were not all zeros, or it contains `[0]` if the original list was all zeros. The list `a` is non-empty and its first element is not zero.***
