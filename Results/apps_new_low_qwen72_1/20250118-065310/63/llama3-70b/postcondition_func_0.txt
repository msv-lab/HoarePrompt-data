The function reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_i < 300). It then processes the list `a` to reduce it to a single element. This element is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original non-zero elements of the list, or 0 if all elements were zero. After processing, the function prints 'BitLGM' if the final element is even, or 'BitAryo' if the final element is odd. If the list becomes empty during processing, the function prints 'BitAryo'. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, and `a` is a list containing a single integer (either the GCD of the original non-zero elements or 0), and the output is either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo' based on the parity of this final element.
