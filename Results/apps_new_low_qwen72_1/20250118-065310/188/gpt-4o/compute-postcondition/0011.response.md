Functionality: ** The function reads an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100). It then determines if there are exactly two unique numbers in the list, each appearing exactly `n // 2` times. If this condition is met, the function prints 'YES' followed by the two numbers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when the list contains fewer than two unique numbers or when the frequencies of the two most frequent numbers do not match the required condition. **
