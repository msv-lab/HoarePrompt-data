The provided code snippet prints 'YES' and then prints the last two elements of the `unique_numbers` list, which are the most frequent and second most frequent numbers in `cards`, both having a frequency of `n // 2`.

Since the code does not modify any variables, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The only action is the printing of the specified values.

Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, cards is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, count is a Counter object containing the frequency of each number in cards, unique_numbers is a list of the unique numbers in cards sorted by their frequency, and the length of unique_numbers is greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, the frequency of the most frequent number (unique_numbers[-1]) is n // 2, and the frequency of the second most frequent number (unique_numbers[-2]) is also n // 2. The output of the code is 'YES' followed by the values of unique_numbers[-1] and unique_numbers[-2].**
