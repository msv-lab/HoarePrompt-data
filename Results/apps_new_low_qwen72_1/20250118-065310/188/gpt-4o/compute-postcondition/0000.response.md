The provided code reads an even integer `n` within the range 2 to 100, then reads `n` integers (each between 1 and 100) into a list called `cards`. It then counts the occurrences of each number in the `cards` list using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module and sorts these unique numbers based on their frequency of occurrence.

Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, cards is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, count is a Counter object containing the frequency of each number in cards, unique_numbers is a list of the unique numbers in cards sorted by their frequency**
