Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, `count` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each number in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers in `cards` sorted by their frequency, and the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2. If the frequency of the most frequent number (`unique_numbers[-1]`) is `n // 2` and the frequency of the second most frequent number (`unique_numbers[-2]`) is also `n // 2`, the output of the code is 'YES' followed by the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.***
