Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

11
27

Output

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.

# Annotated Program:
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each i.
def func():
    n = int(input())

cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]

count = Counter(cards)

unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if (len(unique_numbers) < 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2) :
            print('YES')

print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, `count` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each number in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers in `cards` sorted by their frequency, and the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2. If the frequency of the most frequent number (`unique_numbers[-1]`) is `n // 2` and the frequency of the second most frequent number (`unique_numbers[-2]`) is also `n // 2`, the output of the code is 'YES' followed by the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, `count` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each number in `cards`, and `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers in `cards` sorted by their frequency. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, the state remains unchanged. If the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2, and the frequency of the most frequent number (`unique_numbers[-1]`) is `n // 2` and the frequency of the second most frequent number (`unique_numbers[-2]`) is also `n // 2`, the output of the code is 'YES' followed by the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100). It then determines if there are exactly two unique numbers in the list, each appearing exactly `n // 2` times. If this condition is met, the function prints 'YES' followed by the two numbers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when the list contains fewer than two unique numbers or when the frequencies of the two most frequent numbers do not match the required condition.
