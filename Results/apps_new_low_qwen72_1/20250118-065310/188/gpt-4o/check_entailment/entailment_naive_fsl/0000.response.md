Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle a specific case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
4
10
10
20
20
```

The output should be:
```
YES
10 20
```

However, the current program will output:
```
NO
```

This is because the program checks if the two most frequent numbers appear exactly `n // 2` times each. In the given example, both 10 and 20 appear twice, which satisfies the condition for a fair game. However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it only checks the last two unique numbers in the sorted list, which may not necessarily be the two most frequent numbers. 

To fix this, the program should check if any two distinct numbers appear exactly `n // 2` times each, not just the last two in the sorted list.
