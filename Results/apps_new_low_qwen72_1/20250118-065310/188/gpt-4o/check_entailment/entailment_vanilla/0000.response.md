Reasoning:  
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each number on the cards using `collections.Counter`. The logic then checks if there are at least two different numbers and if the two most frequent numbers appear exactly half the total number of cards each. This ensures that Petya and Vasya can each take exactly half of the cards, making the game fair.

However, the solution has a flaw. It only checks if the two most frequent numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times. This is not sufficient to ensure that all cards can be taken. For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

Here, the two most frequent numbers are 1 and 2, each appearing twice. However, the third number (3) also appears twice, and thus the total number of cards taken by Petya and Vasya would be 4, leaving 2 cards unclaimed. This makes the game unfair.

A correct approach should check if there are exactly two different numbers, each appearing `n // 2` times. If there are more than two different numbers, the game cannot be fair.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    
    if len(count) != 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        num1, num2 = count.keys()
        if count[num1] == n // 2 and count[num2] == n // 2:
            print('YES')
            print(num1, num2)
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This solution correctly checks if there are exactly two different numbers, each appearing `n // 2` times, ensuring the game is fair.

Correctness: **False**
