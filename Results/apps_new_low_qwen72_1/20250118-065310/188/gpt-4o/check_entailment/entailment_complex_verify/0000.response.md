Reasoning:
The original assessment identifies a potential issue with the program's logic, specifically that it only checks the last two unique numbers in the sorted list, which may not necessarily be the two most frequent numbers. However, upon closer inspection, the program's logic actually works correctly for the given problem constraints and examples.

1. **Reading Input and Counting Frequencies:**
   - The program reads `n` and the list of card values.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each card value.

2. **Sorting Unique Numbers by Frequency:**
   - The program sorts the unique numbers by their frequency using `sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - If there are fewer than 2 unique numbers, it prints "NO".
   - If the two most frequent numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times, it prints "YES" followed by these numbers.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the problem constraints and examples:
- The program correctly handles the case where there are fewer than 2 unique numbers.
- The program correctly handles the case where the two most frequent numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times.

For the specific example provided in the original assessment:
```
4
10
10
20
20
```
- The unique numbers are `[10, 20]`.
- Both 10 and 20 appear exactly 2 times, which is `n // 2`.
- The program will correctly output:
  ```
  YES
  10 20
  ```

Thus, the original assessment's claim that the program incorrectly prints "NO" for this input is incorrect. The program's logic is sound and meets the requirements of the problem.

Final: **True**
