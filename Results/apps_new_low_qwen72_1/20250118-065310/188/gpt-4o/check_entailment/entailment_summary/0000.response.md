Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements. It reads the input, counts the occurrences of each number using `Counter`, and checks if there are exactly two unique numbers, each appearing `n // 2` times. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES' followed by the two numbers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The logic ensures that the game is fair if and only if there are exactly two different numbers, each occurring exactly half the total number of cards. This aligns with the problem's constraints and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
