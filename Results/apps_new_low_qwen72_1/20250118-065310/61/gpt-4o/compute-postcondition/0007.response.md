Postcondition: ***s is the input string, n is the integer part of the input string, seat is the last character of the input string, group is (n - 1) // 4, and row_position_in_group is (n - 1) % 4. If row_position_in_group is 0 or 2, base_time remains as group * 24. If row_position_in_group is 1 or 3, base_time is (group * 24) + 7.***
