You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A new airplane SuperPuperJet has an infinite number of rows, numbered with positive integers starting with 1 from cockpit to tail. There are six seats in each row, denoted with letters from 'a' to 'f'. Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle.  [Image] 

 

It's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row 1 while the second attendant serves row 3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row 5 while the second attendant serves row 7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.

Flight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one — in seat 'c'. Assume that all seats are occupied.

Vasya has seat s in row n and wants to know how many seconds will pass before he gets his lunch.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a description of Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) is the index of the row and s is the seat in this row, denoted as letter from 'a' to 'f'. The index of the row and the seat are not separated by a space.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch.


-----Examples-----
Input
1f

Output
1

Input
2d

Output
10

Input
4a

Output
11

Input
5e

Output
18



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the first flight attendant serves Vasya first, so Vasya gets his lunch after 1 second.

In the second sample, the flight attendants will spend 6 seconds to serve everyone in the rows 1 and 3, then they will move one row forward in 1 second. As they first serve seats located to the right of the aisle in order from window to aisle, Vasya has to wait 3 more seconds. The total is 6 + 1 + 3 = 10.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    n = int(s[:-1])
    seat = s[-1]
    group = (n - 1) // 4
    base_time = group * 8 * 3
    row_position_in_group = (n - 1) % 4
    if row_position_in_group == 0 or row_position_in_group == 2:
        base_time += 0
    elif row_position_in_group == 1 or row_position_in_group == 3:
        base_time += 7
    seat_time = {'f': 0, 'e': 1, 'd': 2, 'c': 3, 'b': 4, 'a': 5}[seat]
    total_time = base_time + seat_time + 1
    print(total_time)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string in the format "ns" where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and s is a character from 'a' to 'f' representing the seat in that row.
def func():
    s = input().strip()

n = int(s[:-1])

seat = s[-1]

group = (n - 1) // 4

base_time = group * 8 * 3

row_position_in_group = (n - 1) % 4
    if (row_position_in_group == 0 or row_position_in_group == 2) :
        base_time += 0
    else :
        if (row_position_in_group == 1 or row_position_in_group == 3) :
            base_time += 7
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is the input string, n is the integer part of the input string, seat is the last character of the input string, group is (n - 1) // 4, and row_position_in_group is (n - 1) % 4. If row_position_in_group is 1 or 3, base_time is (group * 24) + 7. Otherwise, base_time remains as group * 24.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *s is the input string, n is the integer part of the input string, seat is the last character of the input string, group is (n - 1) // 4, and row_position_in_group is (n - 1) % 4. If row_position_in_group is 0 or 2, base_time remains as group * 24. If row_position_in_group is 1 or 3, base_time is (group * 24) + 7.
    seat_time = {'f': 0, 'e': 1, 'd': 2, 'c': 3, 'b': 4, 'a': 5}[seat]

total_time = base_time + seat_time + 1

print(total_time)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string input in the format "ns", where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number, and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f' representing the seat in that row. It calculates and prints a total time based on the following logic:
- The row number `n` is divided into groups of 4 rows each.
- Each group contributes a base time of 24 units.
- Rows 1 and 3 within a group add an additional 7 units to the base time.
- The seat position contributes an additional 0 to 5 units, depending on the seat letter ('f' to 'a').
- A final constant of 1 unit is added to the total time.
The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the calculated total time. Edge cases include very large values of `n` (up to 10^18), which should still be handled correctly by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Group Calculation**: The program calculates the group of rows that the attendants are serving using `(n - 1) // 4`. This is correct because every 4 rows, the attendants complete a cycle of serving.

2. **Base Time Calculation**: The base time for each group is calculated as `group * 8 * 3`. This accounts for the time taken to serve 4 rows (8 seconds per row, 3 rows per cycle).

3. **Row Position in Group**: The program correctly identifies the position of the row within the group using `(n - 1) % 4`. This helps in determining whether the row is served by the first or second attendant and the additional time required to move to the next row.

4. **Seat Time Calculation**: The program uses a dictionary to map the seat letters to their respective positions in the serving order. This ensures that the correct time is added based on the seat position.

5. **Total Time Calculation**: The total time is calculated by summing the base time, the additional time for the row position, and the time for the seat position. The `+ 1` at the end accounts for the initial movement or serving action.

The program handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem description correctly. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
