The function processes a string input in the format "ns", where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number, and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f' representing the seat in that row. It calculates and prints a total time based on the following logic:
- The row number `n` is divided into groups of 4 rows each.
- Each group contributes a base time of 24 units.
- Rows 1 and 3 within a group add an additional 7 units to the base time.
- The seat position contributes an additional 0 to 5 units, depending on the seat letter ('f' to 'a').
- A final constant of 1 unit is added to the total time.
The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the calculated total time. Edge cases include very large values of `n` (up to 10^18), which should still be handled correctly by the function.
