The function `func` reads four non-negative integer values `x_p`, `y_p`, `x_v`, and `y_v` from user input, where each value is between 0 and 10^5, inclusive, and the pairs `(x_p, y_p)` and `(x_v, y_v)` are distinct and non-zero. The function calculates the maximum of `x_p` and `y_p` (referred to as `polycarp_distance`) and the maximum of `x_v` and `y_v` (referred to as `vasiliy_distance`). It then compares these two distances and prints 'Polycarp' if `polycarp_distance` is less than or equal to `vasiliy_distance`, otherwise it prints 'Vasiliy'. After the function executes, the variables `x_p`, `y_p`, `x_v`, `y_v`, `polycarp_distance`, and `vasiliy_distance` retain their final computed values, and the program has printed either 'Polycarp' or 'Vasiliy' to the console.
