The provided code reads four non-negative integers from the input, representing the coordinates `(x_p, y_p)` for Polycarp and `(x_v, y_v)` for Vasiliy. It then calculates the maximum distance from the origin for each of them based on their respective coordinates. The distances are stored in the variables `polycarp_distance` and `vasiliy_distance`.

Given the initial state where `x_p`, `y_p`, `x_v`, and `y_v` are non-negative integers within the specified range and satisfy the given conditions, the code updates the distances as follows:

- `polycarp_distance` is set to the maximum of `x_p` and `y_p`.
- `vasiliy_distance` is set to the maximum of `x_v` and `y_v`.

No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **x_p, y_p, x_v, y_v are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x_p, y_p, x_v, y_v ≤ 10^5, (x_p, y_p) ≠ (x_v, y_v), and (x_p, y_p) ≠ (0, 0) and (x_v, y_v) ≠ (0, 0), polycarp_distance is max(x_p, y_p), vasiliy_distance is max(x_v, y_v)**
