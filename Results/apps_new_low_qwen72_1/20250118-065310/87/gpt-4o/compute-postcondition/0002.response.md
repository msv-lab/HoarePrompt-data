The code snippet prints the string 'Polycarp' and does not alter any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **x_p, y_p, x_v, y_v are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x_p, y_p, x_v, y_v ≤ 10^5, (x_p, y_p) ≠ (x_v, y_v), and (x_p, y_p) ≠ (0, 0) and (x_v, y_v) ≠ (0, 0). polycarp_distance is max(x_p, y_p), and vasiliy_distance is max(x_v, y_v). The current value of polycarp_distance is less than or equal to the current value of vasiliy_distance.**
