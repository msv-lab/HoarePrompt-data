Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic:

1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the distance to the origin (0, 0) for both Polycarp and Vasiliy.
   - For Polycarp, the distance is calculated as `max(x_p, y_p)`. This is because Polycarp can only move left or down, so the maximum of the two coordinates represents the minimum number of moves required to reach (0, 0).
   - For Vasiliy, the distance is also calculated as `max(x_v, y_v)`. This is because Vasiliy can move left, down, or diagonally left-down, but the maximum of the two coordinates still represents the minimum number of moves required to reach (0, 0).

2. **Comparison**:
   - The program compares the distances calculated for Polycarp and Vasiliy.
   - If Polycarp's distance is less than or equal to Vasiliy's distance, it prints "Polycarp".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Vasiliy".

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always choose the move that minimizes the distance to (0, 0).
   - The player with the smaller distance will always win because they can reach (0, 0) in fewer or equal moves compared to the other player.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the pawns start at the same distance from (0, 0). In this case, Polycarp wins because he moves first.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy and the initial positions of the pawns.

Correctness: **True**
