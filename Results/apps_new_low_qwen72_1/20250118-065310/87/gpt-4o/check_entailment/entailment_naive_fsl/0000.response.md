Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution only considers the maximum distance each player needs to travel to reach (0, 0) along either the x-axis or the y-axis. However, this approach does not account for the specific movement rules and the interaction between the two players' pawns. Specifically, the program fails to consider the following scenarios:

1. **Interaction Between Players**: The program does not take into account the possibility that one player's movements can block the other player's optimal path. For example, if Polycarp's pawn is at (2, 1) and Vasiliy's pawn is at (2, 2), Polycarp can move to (1, 1) on his first turn, and Vasiliy cannot move to (1, 1) because it would place his pawn on the same cell as Polycarp's pawn. This could potentially change the outcome of the game.

2. **Skipping Moves**: The program does not consider the strategic use of skipping moves, which can be crucial in certain scenarios. For example, if Polycarp is close to (0, 0) but Vasiliy can block his path, Polycarp might need to skip a move to force Vasiliy to make a suboptimal move.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the pawns start very close to each other or where the distances are such that the interaction between the pawns significantly affects the outcome.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a recursive backtracking algorithm that considers all possible moves and interactions between the pawns.
