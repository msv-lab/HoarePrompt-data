Reasoning:  
The logic of the program is based on the idea that the distance to the origin (0, 0) for each player is determined by the maximum of their respective x and y coordinates. This is because both players can only move left or down (or both in the case of Vasiliy), so the number of moves required to reach the origin is dictated by the longer of the two dimensions (x or y).

However, this approach does not fully account for the rules of the game, particularly the restriction that players cannot move to the same cell as the opponent. For example, consider the case where Polycarp starts at (2, 1) and Vasiliy starts at (2, 2). According to the program, the distances are:
- Polycarp's distance: max(2, 1) = 2
- Vasiliy's distance: max(2, 2) = 2

Since both distances are equal, the program would output "Polycarp". However, in this scenario, Vasiliy can block Polycarp by moving to (2, 1) on his first turn, forcing Polycarp to take a longer path to (0, 0). Therefore, the program's logic is incomplete and may lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
