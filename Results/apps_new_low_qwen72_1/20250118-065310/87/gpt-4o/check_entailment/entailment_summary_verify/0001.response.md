Reasoning:

1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function correctly calculates the distance to the origin (0, 0) for both Polycarp and Vasiliy using the maximum of their respective coordinates. This is appropriate because both players need to move along the grid to reach (0, 0), and the maximum coordinate represents the minimum number of moves required to get there.

2. **Comparison**:
   - The program compares the distances calculated for Polycarp and Vasiliy.
   - If Polycarp's distance is less than or equal to Vasiliy's distance, it prints "Polycarp".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Vasiliy".
   - This comparison is correct because the player with the smaller distance will always win if both play optimally. Since Polycarp moves first, if their distances are equal, Polycarp will still win.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program assumes both players play optimally, which is a reasonable assumption for this type of game. The optimal strategy for both players is to minimize the distance to (0, 0) in each move.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the pawns start at the same distance from (0, 0). In this case, Polycarp wins because he moves first.

5. **Additional Restrictions**:
   - The problem description mentions that a player cannot move to a cell with negative coordinates or to a cell containing the opponent's pawn. However, since the distance calculation and comparison are based on the maximum of the coordinates, these restrictions do not affect the correctness of the program. The players will always make valid moves that bring them closer to (0, 0).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy and the initial positions of the pawns.

Final: **True**
