### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Polycarp and Vasiliy, moving their pawns on an infinite chessboard. The goal is to reach the cell (0, 0) while adhering to specific movement rules and restrictions.

2. **Movement Rules**:
   - Polycarp can move to (x-1, y) or (x, y-1).
   - Vasiliy can move to (x-1, y), (x-1, y-1), or (x, y-1).
   - Both can skip a move.
   - Neither can move to a cell with negative coordinates or to a cell occupied by the other player.

3. **Winning Condition**: The player who reaches (0, 0) first wins.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program calculates the maximum distance from the starting position to (0, 0) for both players.
   - `polycarp_distance` is calculated as `max(x_p, y_p)`.
   - `vasiliy_distance` is calculated as `max(x_v, y_v)`.
   - The program then compares these distances:
     - If `polycarp_distance` is less than or equal to `vasiliy_distance`, it prints "Polycarp".
     - Otherwise, it prints "Vasiliy".

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of comparing the maximum distances is correct because the player with the smaller maximum distance will reach (0, 0) first, assuming both players play optimally.
   - The program correctly handles the input constraints and the conditions for the game.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program ensures that the initial positions are valid and different, and neither is at (0, 0).
   - The comparison logic is straightforward and should cover all valid cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
