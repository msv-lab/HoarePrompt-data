`green_paint` is calculated as the sum of the first `i` elements of `heights` minus `red_paint`. Since `i` is 1, `green_paint` is calculated as `heights[0] - red_paint`.

The initial state provides that `heights` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 200, and `red_paint` is 0. Thus, `green_paint` will be equal to `heights[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) initialized to infinity, `dp[0][0]` is 0, `i` is 1, `red_paint` is 0, `green_paint` is `heights[0]`.**
