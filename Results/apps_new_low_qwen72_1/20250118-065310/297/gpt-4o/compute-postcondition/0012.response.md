Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) initialized to infinity, `dp[0][0]` is 0, `i` is 1, `red_paint` is 1, `green_paint` is `heights[0]`. If `red_paint` is greater than or equal to `heights[i - 1]`, then `green_paint` remains `heights[0]` and `red_paint` is 1. If `green_paint` is less than or equal to `b`, then `green_paint` is less than or equal to `b`.***
