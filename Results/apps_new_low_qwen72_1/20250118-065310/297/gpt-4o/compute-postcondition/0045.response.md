To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The variable `n` defines the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\).

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 2 to 3.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) with `dp[0][0]` being 0 and other entries updated based on the loop, `i` is 3, `red_paint` is `a`, and `green_paint` is `sum(heights[:3]) - a`.**
