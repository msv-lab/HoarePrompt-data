Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than or equal to 0, `red_paint` is 0, `green_paint` is the sum of the elements in `heights[:i]`, if `red_paint` is greater than or equal to `heights[i - 1]`, `dp[i][0]` is updated to `min(dp[i][0], dp[i - 1][0])`. Additionally, the current value of `green_paint` is less than or equal to `b`***
