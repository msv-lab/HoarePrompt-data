To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State Before the Loop Starts:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\).
- `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\).
- `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\).
- `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\).
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) initialized to infinity.
- `dp[0][0]` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1.
- The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1.

### Required State for the Loop to Execute the First Time:
- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- The other variables (`a`, `b`, `heights`, and `dp`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to start, but they must still be in their initial states as given.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) initialized to infinity, `dp[0][0]` is 0, `i` is 1**
