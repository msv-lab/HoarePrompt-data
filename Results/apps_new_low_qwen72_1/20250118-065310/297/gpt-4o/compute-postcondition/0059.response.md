Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than or equal to 0, `red_paint` is 1, `green_paint` is the sum of the elements in `heights[:i]` - 1, and `dp` remains unchanged except for the following: if `green_paint` is less than or equal to `b`, then `dp[i][1]` is set to `min(dp[i][1], dp[i - 1][1] + (heights[i - 1] if i > 1 and dp[i - 1][1] != float('inf') else 0))`. If `green_paint` is greater than `b`, `dp` remains unchanged.***
