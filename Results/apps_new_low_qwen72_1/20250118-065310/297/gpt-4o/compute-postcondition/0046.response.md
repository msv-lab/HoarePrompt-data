To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for red_paint in range(a + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `red_paint` and `a`.
2. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(a + 1)` is non-empty. This means that `a + 1` must be greater than 0, which implies `a` must be greater than or equal to 0.
3. **Initial State**: Since the loop is about to start, `red_paint` will be initialized to 0 (the first value in the range).

### Adjusted State:
- `a` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute.
- `red_paint` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`a` must be greater than or equal to 0, `red_paint` is 0**
