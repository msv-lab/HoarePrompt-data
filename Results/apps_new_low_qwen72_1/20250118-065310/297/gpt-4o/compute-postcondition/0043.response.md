Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) initialized to infinity, `dp[0][0]` is 0. If `green_paint` (which is \(\text{heights}[0] + \text{heights}[1] - 2\)) is less than or equal to `b`, then `dp[2][2]` is set to 0. `i` is 2, `red_paint` is 2, and `green_paint` remains as \(\text{heights}[0] + \text{heights}[1] - 2\).***
