Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than or equal to 0, `red_paint` is 0, `green_paint` is the sum of the elements in `heights[:i]`. If `green_paint` is less than or equal to `b` and `red_paint` is greater than or equal to `heights[i - 1]`, `dp[i][0]` is updated to `min(dp[i][0], dp[i - 1][0])`. Additionally, `dp[i][red_paint]` is updated to `min(dp[i][red_paint], dp[i - 1][red_paint] + (heights[i - 1] if i > 1 and dp[i - 1][red_paint] != float('inf') else 0))`. If `green_paint` is greater than `b`, no changes are made to `dp`.***
