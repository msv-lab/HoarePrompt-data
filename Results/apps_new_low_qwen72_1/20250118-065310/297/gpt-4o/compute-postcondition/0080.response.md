Output State: **The program returns -1 if `result` is `float('inf')`, otherwise it returns the minimum value found in `dp[n]` that is not `float('inf')`. `result` is determined from the minimum non-infinite value in the last row of `dp` which corresponds to the final state of painting `n` fences with `a` units of red paint and the remaining height covered by green paint.**
