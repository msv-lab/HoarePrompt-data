Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than or equal to 0, `red_paint` is 1, `green_paint` is the sum of the elements in `heights[:i]`, and `dp` remains unchanged except for the following: if `red_paint` (which is 1) is greater than or equal to `heights[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][1]` is set to `min(dp[i][1], dp[i - 1][1 - heights[i - 1]])`.***
