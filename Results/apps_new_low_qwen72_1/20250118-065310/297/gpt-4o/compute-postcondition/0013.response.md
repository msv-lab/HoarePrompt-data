The code snippet `green_paint = sum(heights[:i]) - red_paint` updates the value of `green_paint`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1.
- `red_paint` is 1.
- `heights` is a list of `n` integers, and `heights[0]` is the first element of this list.

The slice `heights[:i]` will include only the first element of `heights` because `i` is 1. Therefore, `sum(heights[:i])` is equivalent to `heights[0]`.

Thus, the new value of `green_paint` is calculated as:
\[ \text{green_paint} = \text{heights}[0] - 1 \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) initialized to infinity, `dp[0][0]` is 0, `i` is 1, `red_paint` is 1, `green_paint` is `heights[0] - 1`. If `green_paint` is less than or equal to `b`, then `green_paint` is less than or equal to `b`.**
