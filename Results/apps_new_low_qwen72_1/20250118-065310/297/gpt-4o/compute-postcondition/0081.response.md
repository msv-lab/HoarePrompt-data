The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `heights`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, representing the number of fences. `a` and `b` are integers where 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 4·10^4, representing the units of red and green paint available, respectively. `heights` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ heights[i] ≤ 200, representing the heights of the fences.

The function returns the minimum value found in `dp[n]` that is not `float('inf')`, which corresponds to the minimum cost of painting all `n` fences with the given constraints on the amount of red (`a`) and green (`b`) paint. If no valid way to paint the fences exists (i.e., `result` is `float('inf')`), the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `heights`. It returns the minimum cost of painting all `n` fences using `a` units of red paint and `b` units of green paint, or -1 if no valid painting configuration exists.**
