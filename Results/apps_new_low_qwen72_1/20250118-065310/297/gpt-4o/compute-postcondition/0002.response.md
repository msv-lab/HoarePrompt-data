To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\)
- `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\)
- `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\)
- `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\)
- `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) initialized to infinity
- `dp[0][0]` is 0
- `i` is 1

Loop Statement:
```python
for red_paint in range(a + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variable**: The loop control variable is `red_paint`, which iterates over the range from 0 to `a`.
2. **Range Condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value. This means `a + 1` must be greater than 0, which implies `a` must be at least 0.

### Initial State:
- `a` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The other variables (`n`, `b`, `heights`, `dp`, `i`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition but are part of the initial state.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `a` must be at least 0.
- `red_paint` starts at 0.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `b` is an integer where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\), `heights` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\), `dp` is a 2D list of size \((n + 1) \times (a + 1)\) initialized to infinity, `dp[0][0]` is 0, `i` is 1, `red_paint` is 0, and `a` must be at least 0.**
