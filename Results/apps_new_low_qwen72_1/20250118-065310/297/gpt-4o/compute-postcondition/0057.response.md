The value of `green_paint` is updated to the sum of the elements in `heights[:i]` minus `red_paint`. Given that `red_paint` is 1, the new value of `green_paint` is the sum of the elements in `heights[:i]` minus 1. The values of `a`, `red_paint`, and `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 0, `red_paint` is 1, `green_paint` is the sum of the elements in `heights[:i]` - 1, `dp` remains unchanged except for the following: if `red_paint` (which is 1) is greater than or equal to `heights[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][1]` is set to `min(dp[i][1], dp[i - 1][1 - heights[i - 1]])`.**
