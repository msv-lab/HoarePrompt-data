Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `red_paint` is 2, `green_paint` is the sum of the elements in `heights[:i]` - 1. If `red_paint` is greater than or equal to `heights[i - 1]`, `dp[i][2]` is updated to `min(dp[i][2], dp[i - 1][2 - heights[i - 1]])`. If `green_paint` is less than or equal to `b`, `dp[i][1]` is set to `min(dp[i][1], dp[i - 1][1] + (heights[i - 1] if i > 1 and dp[i - 1][1] != float('inf') else 0))`. If `green_paint` is greater than `b`, `dp` remains unchanged.***
