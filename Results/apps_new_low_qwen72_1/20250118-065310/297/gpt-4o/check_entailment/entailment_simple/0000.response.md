### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to minimize the "unattractiveness" of the fence, which is defined as the total length of contact between neighboring boards painted in different colors.
   - The constraints are that the total area painted red cannot exceed `a` square centimeters, and the total area painted green cannot exceed `b` square centimeters.
   - The program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The `dp` array is defined such that `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum unattractiveness for painting the first `i` boards using `j` square centimeters of red paint.
   - The initial state is `dp[0][0] = 0`, meaning no boards are painted and there is no unattractiveness.
   - For each board `i`, the program considers two cases:
     - Painting the current board red.
     - Painting the current board green.
   - The program updates the `dp` table accordingly, ensuring that the total area constraints (`a` and `b`) are not violated.

3. **State Transitions**:
   - When painting the current board red, the unattractiveness is updated based on the previous state where the current board was not painted red.
   - When painting the current board green, the unattractiveness is updated based on the previous state where the current board was not painted green, plus the height of the current board if the previous board was painted red.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After filling the `dp` table, the program finds the minimum unattractiveness value from the last row of the `dp` table that does not exceed the area constraints.
   - If no valid solution is found, the program returns `-1`.

5. **Code Review**:
   - The code correctly initializes the `dp` table and handles the state transitions.
   - The logic for updating the `dp` table ensures that the area constraints are respected.
   - The final result is correctly computed by finding the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` table that is not `float('inf')`.
