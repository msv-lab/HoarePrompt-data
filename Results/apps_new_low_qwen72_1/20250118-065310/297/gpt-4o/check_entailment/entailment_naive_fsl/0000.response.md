Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not handle the case where it is impossible to paint the fence according to the given constraints. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in `func_1` initializes the DP table with `float('inf')` and updates it based on the conditions for painting red or green. However, the final check for the result only considers the minimum value found in the last row of the DP table. This means that if no valid way to paint the fence exists (i.e., the constraints on the areas `a` and `b` cannot be met), the function will still return `-1` even if the DP table does not reflect an impossible state correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 3
2 2 2
```
Here, the total area to be painted is 6 square centimeters, and the constraints are 2 square centimeters for red and 3 square centimeters for green. It is impossible to paint the fence under these constraints because the total area exceeds the sum of `a` and `b`. However, the program does not correctly handle this case and might return an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the final result is only considered valid if the total painted area matches the constraints for both red and green.
