You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya should paint a fence in front of his own cottage. The fence is a sequence of n wooden boards arranged in a single row. Each board is a 1 centimeter wide rectangle. Let's number the board fence using numbers 1, 2, ..., n from left to right. The height of the i-th board is h_{i} centimeters.

Vasya has a 1 centimeter wide brush and the paint of two colors, red and green. Of course, the amount of the paint is limited. Vasya counted the area he can paint each of the colors. It turned out that he can not paint over a square centimeters of the fence red, and he can not paint over b square centimeters green. Each board of the fence should be painted exactly one of the two colors. Perhaps Vasya won't need one of the colors.

In addition, Vasya wants his fence to look smart. To do this, he should paint the fence so as to minimize the value that Vasya called the fence unattractiveness value. Vasya believes that two consecutive fence boards, painted different colors, look unattractive. The unattractiveness value of a fence is the total length of contact between the neighboring boards of various colors. To make the fence look nice, you need to minimize the value as low as possible. Your task is to find what is the minimum unattractiveness Vasya can get, if he paints his fence completely. $1$ 

The picture shows the fence, where the heights of boards (from left to right) are 2,3,2,4,3,1. The first and the fifth boards are painted red, the others are painted green. The first and the second boards have contact length 2, the fourth and fifth boards have contact length 3, the fifth and the sixth have contact length 1. Therefore, the unattractiveness of the given painted fence is 2+3+1=6.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of boards in Vasya's fence.

The second line contains two integers a and b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 4·10^4) — the area that can be painted red and the area that can be painted green, correspondingly.

The third line contains a sequence of n integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} (1 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 200) — the heights of the fence boards.

All numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the minimum unattractiveness value Vasya can get if he paints his fence completely. If it is impossible to do, print  - 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of minimizing the "unattractiveness" of a fence when painted with two colors, red and green, under the constraints of the available paint areas for each color. Here's a breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of boards `n`, the maximum area that can be painted red `a`, and the maximum area that can be painted green `b`.
   - The heights of the boards are stored in a list `heights`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:**
   - A dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(n + 1) x (a + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum unattractiveness value for painting the first `i` boards with `j` units of red paint.
   - The initial state `dp[0][0]` is set to 0, indicating no unattractiveness for zero boards and zero red paint used.

3. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - The program iterates over each board `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each board, it iterates over the possible amounts of red paint `red_paint` from 0 to `a`.
   - If the current board can be painted red (i.e., `red_paint >= heights[i - 1]`), it updates the DP table to consider the case where the current board is painted red.
   - It also calculates the amount of green paint used (`green_paint`) and checks if it is within the limit `b`. If so, it updates the DP table to consider the case where the current board is painted green.
   - The unattractiveness is added if the previous board was painted a different color.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - After filling the DP table, the program finds the minimum unattractiveness value among all possible valid states (where the total red paint used is within the limit).
   - If no valid solution is found, it returns `-1`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It ensures that the constraints on the areas that can be painted red and green are respected and minimizes the unattractiveness value. The logic for updating the DP table and calculating the result is sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
