    #The program returns -1 if `result` is `float('inf')`, otherwise it returns the minimum value found in `dp[n]` that is not `float('inf')`. `result` is determined from the minimum non-infinite value in the last row of `dp` which corresponds to the final state of painting `n` fences with `a` units of red paint and the remaining height covered by green paint.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of fences, where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\)), `a` (an integer representing the available units of red paint, where \(0 \leq a \leq 4 \times 10^4\)), `b` (an integer representing the available units of green paint, where \(0 \leq b \leq 4 \times 10^4\)), and `heights` (a list of `n` integers representing the heights of the fences, where \(1 \leq \text{heights}[i] \leq 200\)). The function returns the minimum cost of painting all `n` fences such that exactly `a` units of red paint are used and the remaining height is covered by green paint, ensuring that the total green paint used does not exceed `b` units. If no valid painting configuration exists, the function returns -1. The function uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost, where the `dp` table stores the minimum cost of painting up to the `i-th` fence using a certain amount of red paint. The final state of the program includes the original parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `heights` unchanged, and the `dp` table populated with the computed costs. The function ensures that the constraints on the total amount of red and green paint are respected. Edge cases include scenarios where no valid painting configuration exists (e.g., when the total height of the fences exceeds the available green paint `b` or when the required red paint `a` cannot be used within the given constraints).
