The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2000\), and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, with at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.

The function determines the bounding box of all `'w'` characters in the `screen` and then modifies the `screen` to create a frame around this bounding box by changing certain `'.'` characters to `'+'`.
