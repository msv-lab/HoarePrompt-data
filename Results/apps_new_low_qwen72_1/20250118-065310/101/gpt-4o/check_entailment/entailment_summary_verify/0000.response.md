### Reasoning:

The original assessment points out a critical flaw in the program: it does not handle the case where the smallest possible frame is a 1x1 frame (a single pixel). According to the problem description, a 1x1 frame is valid if it is the only white pixel. However, the current implementation checks if `frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2` and returns `-1` in such cases, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Bounding Box Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the bounding box of all white pixels (`'w'`). It finds the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels.

2. **Frame Size Check**: The function then checks if the height and width of the bounding box are both at least 2. If either dimension is less than 2, it returns `-1`.

3. **Handling 1x1 Frame**: The problem description explicitly states that a 1x1 frame (a single white pixel) is valid. However, the current implementation incorrectly returns `-1` for such cases because it checks `frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2`.

4. **Example Validation**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     2 2
     ..
     .w
     ```
     The expected output should be:
     ```
     ..
     .w
     ```
     But the program will incorrectly return `-1`.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where the smallest possible frame is a 1x1 frame correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
