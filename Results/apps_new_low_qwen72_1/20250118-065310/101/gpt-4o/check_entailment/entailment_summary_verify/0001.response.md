### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the screen (`n`, `m`) and the state of each pixel, storing the screen as a list of strings where each string represents a row of the screen.
   - This part is implemented correctly and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Finding Boundaries**:
   - The program iterates through each pixel to find the minimum and maximum row (`top`, `bottom`) and column (`left`, `right`) indices where white pixels are found.
   - This step is crucial for determining the boundaries of the smallest possible square frame that can cover all white pixels.
   - The logic here is sound and correctly identifies the bounding box of the white pixels.

3. **Frame Size Calculation**:
   - After finding the boundaries, the program calculates the height and width of the potential frame.
   - It checks if either dimension is less than 2, which would mean that no valid frame can be drawn (since a frame needs at least 2x2 pixels to form a border).
   - This check is necessary to ensure that the frame is valid and can be drawn.

4. **Frame Drawing**:
   - If a valid frame can be drawn, the program updates the screen to replace the black pixels (".") along the calculated frame boundaries with "+" symbols, while leaving the original white pixels ('w') unchanged.
   - This step is implemented correctly and ensures that the frame is drawn properly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the modified screen if a valid frame is found, or `-1` if no such frame can be drawn.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where the frame size is less than 2, returning `-1`.
  - It also handles cases where the frame size is exactly 1, which is a valid case according to the problem description.
- **Multiple Possible Frames**:
  - The problem statement allows for multiple possible frames of the same minimum size. The program does not explicitly handle this, but since it returns any valid frame, it meets the requirements.
- **Correctness of Frame Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the frame based on the bounding box of the white pixels, ensuring that all white pixels are within the frame.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the smallest possible square frame that covers all white pixels and draws the frame as required. It handles all edge cases and meets the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
