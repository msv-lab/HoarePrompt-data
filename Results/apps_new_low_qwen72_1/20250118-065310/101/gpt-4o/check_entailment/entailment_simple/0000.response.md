Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Validation**:
   - The program correctly parses the input dimensions `n` and `m` and reads the screen into a list of strings.
   - It ensures that the input is within the specified bounds and that there is at least one 'w' character in the screen.

2. **Finding the Bounding Box**:
   - The program iterates through the entire screen to find the smallest bounding box that encloses all 'w' pixels. This is done by updating `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to the minimum and maximum indices of rows and columns containing 'w'.
   - The initial values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to `None` and are updated only when a 'w' is found. This ensures that these variables are only set if there is at least one 'w' pixel.

3. **Frame Validation**:
   - After determining the bounding box, the program checks if the frame height and width are at least 2. If either dimension is less than 2, it returns `-1` because a frame of width 1 pixel cannot be formed.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program creates a copy of the screen and updates the boundary pixels of the bounding box to `+` if they are currently `.`.
   - The final result is returned as a list of lists, which is then printed out.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there is only one 'w' pixel (returns `-1` because a frame of width 1 pixel cannot be formed).
   - It also handles cases where the frame cannot be formed due to the arrangement of 'w' pixels.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
