Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the smallest square frame that can enclose all the white pixels ('w') on a given screen, and then mark the frame with '+' symbols. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the screen and the screen itself from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Finding the Bounding Box:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to `None`.
   - It iterates through the entire screen to find the minimum and maximum row and column indices (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) that contain 'w' characters.
   - This step correctly identifies the bounding box of the white pixels.

3. **Validating the Bounding Box:**
   - If any of the bounding box variables (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) remain `None` after the loop, it means no 'w' characters were found, and the function returns `-1`.
   - This check is necessary and correct.

4. **Checking Frame Size:**
   - The program calculates the height and width of the bounding box (`frame_height` and `frame_width`).
   - If either dimension is less than 2, it returns `-1` because a frame of width 1 cannot be drawn.
   - This check ensures that the frame is valid and can be drawn.

5. **Drawing the Frame:**
   - The program creates a copy of the screen in the `result` variable.
   - It iterates over the bounding box and marks the boundary with '+' symbols, but only if the current position is a '.' (black pixel).
   - This step correctly marks the frame without altering the existing 'w' characters.

6. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the modified `result` screen, which now includes the frame marked with '+' symbols.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the smallest possible frame that encloses all white pixels and marks it appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
