Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

After the loop completes, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`. The variables `n`, `m`, and the content of `screen` remain constant throughout the loop. The loop iterates through all `n` rows and `m` columns, ensuring that `i` will be `n` and `j` will be `m` after the loop ends.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop has finished executing, the variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged. The variable `i` has the value `bottom + 1`. All elements in `result` at positions `[i][j]` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right` will be updated to '+' if they were initially '.', and all other elements in `result` remain unchanged.
    return result
    #The program returns `result`, which is a 2D list where all elements at positions `[i][j]` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right` have been updated to '+' if they were initially '.', and all other elements remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2000\), and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, with at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.

The function determines the bounding box of all `'w'` characters in the `screen` and then modifies the `screen` to create a frame around this bounding box by changing certain `'.'` characters to `'+'`.
