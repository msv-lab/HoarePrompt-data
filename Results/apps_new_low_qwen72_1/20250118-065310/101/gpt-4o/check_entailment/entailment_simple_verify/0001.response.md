Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of the screen (`n`, `m`) and the state of each pixel, storing the screen as a list of strings where each string represents a row of the screen. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Finding Boundaries**: The program iterates through each pixel to find the minimum and maximum row (`top`, `bottom`) and column (`left`, `right`) indices where white pixels are found. This step is crucial for determining the boundaries of the smallest possible square frame that can cover all white pixels. The logic here is sound and correctly identifies the boundaries.

3. **Frame Size Calculation**: After finding the boundaries, the program calculates the height and width of the potential frame. It checks if either dimension is less than 2, which would mean that no valid frame can be drawn (since a frame needs at least 2x2 pixels to form a border). This check is necessary and correctly implemented.

4. **Frame Drawing**: If a valid frame can be drawn, the program updates the screen to replace the black pixels (".") along the calculated frame boundaries with "+" symbols, while leaving the original white pixels ('w') unchanged. This part is also correctly implemented and ensures that the frame is drawn as required.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the modified screen if a valid frame is found, or `-1` if no such frame can be drawn. The output format is correct and matches the problem description.

**Additional Considerations**:
- The program correctly handles the case where there are no white pixels, although the problem guarantees that there is at least one white pixel.
- The program ensures that the frame is the smallest possible square that covers all white pixels, which aligns with the problem requirements.

**Challenges to the Original Assessment**:
- The original assessment did not explicitly mention the handling of edge cases where the frame size is 1 (a single white pixel). However, the program correctly handles this by returning the screen unchanged, which is the expected behavior.
- The original assessment did not explicitly verify the correctness of the frame drawing logic, but the logic is correct and matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **True**
