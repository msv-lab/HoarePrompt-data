Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does indeed fail to handle the case where the smallest possible frame is a 1x1 frame (a single pixel). According to the problem description, a 1x1 frame is valid if it is the only white pixel. However, the current implementation checks if `frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2` and returns `-1` in such cases, which is incorrect. This means the program will fail for inputs where the only white pixel is the smallest possible frame.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 2
..
.w
```
The expected output should be:
```
..
.w
```
But the program will incorrectly return `-1`.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is valid.

Final: **False**
