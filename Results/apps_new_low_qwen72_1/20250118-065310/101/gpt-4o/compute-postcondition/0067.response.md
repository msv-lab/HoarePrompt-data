The provided code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`, and the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Therefore, `top` and `bottom` will both become 0, and `left` and `right` will both become 1. The variables `n`, `m`, and `screen` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, m is an integer such that 1 < m â‰¤ 2000, screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, i is 0, j is 1, top is 0, bottom is 0, left is 1, right is 1**
