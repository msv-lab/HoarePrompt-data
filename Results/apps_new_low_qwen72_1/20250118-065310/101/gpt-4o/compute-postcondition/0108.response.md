Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'` (or 0 if `j` is less than `left`), `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'` (or `j` if `j` is greater than `right`), and the character at position `screen[1][0]` is `'w'`.***
