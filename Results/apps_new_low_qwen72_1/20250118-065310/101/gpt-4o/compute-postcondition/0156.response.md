To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the current state:

### Given Loop:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen
- `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a 'w'
- `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a 'w'
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w'
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w'
- `frame_height` is (bottom - top + 1)
- `frame_width` is (right - left + 1)
- Both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2
- `result` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters from the corresponding string in `screen`
- `i` is `top`
- `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`
- If `i` is equal to `top`, `i` is equal to `bottom`, `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`, and `result[i][j]` was '.', it is now '+'
- `j` is `right + 1`
- If `result[i][j]` was '.', it is now '+'; otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range `left` to `right + 1`. The variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `[left, right + 1)`. 

### Adjustments Needed:
- `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range.
- The current value of `j` is `right + 1`, so the next value should be `left`.

### New State:
- `j` should be set to `left` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a 'w', `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a 'w', `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w', `right` is the largest column index of any 'w', `frame_height` is (bottom - top + 1), `frame_width` is (right - left + 1), both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters from the corresponding string in `screen`, `i` is `top`, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, and `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. If `i` is equal to `top`, `i` is equal to `bottom`, `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`, and `result[i][j]` was '.', it is now '+'. `j` is `left`. If `result[i][j]` was '.', it is now '+'; otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
