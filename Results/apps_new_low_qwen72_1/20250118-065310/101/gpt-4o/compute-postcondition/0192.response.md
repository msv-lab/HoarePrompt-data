Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `right`, `i` is `top + 2`, `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged, `n`, `m`, `screen`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged. If `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right`, all elements in `result` at positions `[i][j]` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right` will be updated to '+' if they were initially '.', otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
