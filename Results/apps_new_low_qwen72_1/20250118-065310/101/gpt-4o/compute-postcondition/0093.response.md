Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`. Additionally, the character at position `screen[1][0]` is `'w'`.**
