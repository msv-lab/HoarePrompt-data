The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 1), and `m` must still be greater than `j` (so `m` must be at least 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 1, `m` must be at least 2. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, and `top` is `None`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to 0, and `right` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to 0. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to 0. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.**
