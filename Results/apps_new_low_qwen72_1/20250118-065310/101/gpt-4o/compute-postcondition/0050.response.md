The provided code snippet sets the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to the current values of `i` and `j`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, and `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`. This means that the topmost and leftmost occurrences of `'w'` are both at position (0, 0).

Output State: **n is greater than 0, m is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, top is 0, bottom is 0, left is 0, right is 0, i is 0, j is 0, and the current value of screen[i][j] is 'w'.**
