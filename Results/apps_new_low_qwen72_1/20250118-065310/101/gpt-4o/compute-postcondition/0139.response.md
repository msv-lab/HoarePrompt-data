Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. After the loop completes, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`. The variables `n`, `m`, and the content of `screen` remain constant throughout the loop. The loop iterates through all `n` rows and `m` columns, ensuring that `i` will be `n` and `j` will be `m` after the loop ends. Additionally, `top` is not `None`, `bottom` is not `None`, `left` is not `None`, and `right` is not `None`.**
