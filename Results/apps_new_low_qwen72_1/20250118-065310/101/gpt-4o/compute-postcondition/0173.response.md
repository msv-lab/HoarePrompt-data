The value at the position `[i][j]` in the `result` list is set to `'+'`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `left` is less than or equal to `right` remains unchanged. The value of `right` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `j + 1`, `right` is `right`, `result[i][j-1]` is `'+'`.
Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `j + 1`, `right` is `right`, `result[i][j-1]` is `'+'`**
