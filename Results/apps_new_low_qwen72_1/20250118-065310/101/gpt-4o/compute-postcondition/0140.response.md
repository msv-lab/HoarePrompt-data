The provided code calculates the dimensions of a frame based on the positions of `'w'` characters in a grid (`screen`). The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are used to determine the smallest rectangle that contains all `'w'` characters. The code then computes `frame_height` and `frame_width` based on these indices.

- `frame_height` is calculated as the difference between `bottom` and `top`, plus 1. This gives the height of the frame.
- `frame_width` is calculated as the difference between `right` and `left`, plus 1. This gives the width of the frame.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, and the content of `screen` remain unchanged. The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are already defined and are not `None`.

Output State: **n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), m is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, top is the smallest index of any row containing a 'w', bottom is the largest index of any row containing a 'w', left is the smallest column index of any 'w', right is the largest column index of any 'w', frame_height is (bottom - top + 1), frame_width is (right - left + 1)**.
