The value of `left` is updated to `j`. Since `j` is 1, `left` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 1, `m` must be at least 2, `left` is 1, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`, otherwise, `top`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.**
