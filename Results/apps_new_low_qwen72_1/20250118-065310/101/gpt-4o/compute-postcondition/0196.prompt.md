You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. After the loop completes, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`. The variables `n`, `m`, and the content of `screen` remain constant throughout the loop. The loop iterates through all `n` rows and `m` columns, ensuring that `i` will be `n` and `j` will be `m` after the loop ends.
    if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None) :
        return -1

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. After the loop completes, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`. The variables `n`, `m`, and the content of `screen` remain constant throughout the loop. The loop iterates through all `n` rows and `m` columns, ensuring that `i` will be `n` and `j` will be `m` after the loop ends. Additionally, `top` is not `None`, `bottom` is not `None`, `left` is not `None`, and `right` is not `None`.
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1

frame_width = right - left + 1

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop has finished executing, the variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged. The variable `i` has the value `bottom + 1`. All elements in `result` at positions `[i][j]` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right` will be updated to '+' if they were initially '.', and all other elements in `result` remain unchanged.
    return result
    #The program returns `result`, which is a 2D list where all elements at positions `[i][j]` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right` have been updated to '+' if they were initially '.', and all other elements remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen` representing a grid. In Case_1 and Case_2, it returns -1. In Case_3, it returns a modified version of `screen` where the border elements that were initially '.' are changed to '+', while all other elements remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns -1

Case_3: The program returns `result`, which is a 2D list where all elements at positions `[i][j]` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right` have been updated to '+' if they were initially '.', and all other elements remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
