Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a 'w', `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a 'w', `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w', `right` is the largest column index of any 'w', `frame_height` is (bottom - top + 1), `frame_width` is (right - left + 1), both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters from the corresponding string in `screen`, `i` is `top`, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, and `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. Additionally, either `i` is equal to `top`, `i` is equal to `bottom`, `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`. If `result[i][j]` was '.', it is now '+'***.
