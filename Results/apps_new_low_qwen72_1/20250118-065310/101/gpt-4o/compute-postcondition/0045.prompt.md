Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if screen[i][j] == 'w':
        if top is None:
            top = bottom = i
            left = right = j
        else:
            if i < top:
                top = i
            if i > bottom:
                bottom = i
            if j < left:
                left = j
            if j > right:
                right = j


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 0. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, and `top` is `None`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to 0, and `right` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to 0. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to 0. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 1, `m` must be at least 2. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'` and `top` is `None`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to 1, and `right` is set to 1. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'` and `top` is not `None`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to 1. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to 1. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 2, `m` must be at least 2. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, and `top` is `None`, `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to 2, and `right` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, `top` is updated to `i` if `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` is updated to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`, `left` is updated to 2 if `j` is less than `left`, and `right` is set to 2 if `j` is greater than `right`. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, the variables remain unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
