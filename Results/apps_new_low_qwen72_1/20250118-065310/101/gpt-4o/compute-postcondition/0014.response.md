The code snippet `left = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 0) to `left`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 0, the character at position `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. Additionally, `j` is less than `left`, `left` is 0.**
