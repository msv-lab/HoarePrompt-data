Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. If `j > right`, then `right` is updated to 1. If `j < left`, then `left` is 2. If `top` is `None`, `right` is 1. If `i` > `bottom`, the state of the variables remains as described above.***
