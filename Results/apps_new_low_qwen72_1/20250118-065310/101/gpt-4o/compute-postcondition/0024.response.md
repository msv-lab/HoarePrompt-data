Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 1, `m` must be at least 2. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
