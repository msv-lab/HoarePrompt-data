The provided code block updates the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` based on the initial conditions. Hereâ€™s the analysis:

- The initial state specifies that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2.
- The first line `top = bottom = i` sets both `top` and `bottom` to the value of `i`, which is 0.
- The second line `left = right = j` sets both `left` and `right` to the value of `j`, which is 2.

Since the initial state also includes conditions about the `screen` and the variables `left` and `right`, let's consider these:

- The condition `If screen[i][j] is 'w', then left is 1` would have set `left` to 1 if `screen[0][2]` were `'w'`. However, since `left` is explicitly set to `j` (which is 2) in the code, this condition is overridden.
- The condition `If top is None, right is 1` is not applicable because `top` is already set to 0.
- The condition `If j > right, then right is updated to 1` is not applicable because `right` is already set to `j` (which is 2).

Thus, the final state after executing the code block is:

Output State: **n is greater than 0, m is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 2000\), screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, i is 0, j is 2, top is 0, bottom is 0, left is 2, right is 2**
