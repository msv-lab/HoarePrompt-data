Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `j` > `right`, then `left` is 1, `right` is 2, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 1. Otherwise, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain 1.***
