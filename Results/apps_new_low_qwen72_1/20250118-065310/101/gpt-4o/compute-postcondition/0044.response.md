Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 2, `m` must be at least 2. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, and `top` is `None`, `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to 2, and `right` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, `top` is updated to `i` if `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` is updated to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`, `left` is updated to 2 if `j` is less than `left`, and `right` is set to 2 if `j` is greater than `right`. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, the variables remain unchanged.***
