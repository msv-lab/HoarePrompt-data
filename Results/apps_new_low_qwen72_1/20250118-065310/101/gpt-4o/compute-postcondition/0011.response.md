The value of `bottom` is updated to `i`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions. Since `i` is greater than the current value of `bottom`, `bottom` now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 0, the character at position `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`, and `bottom` is `i`, `left` and `right` remain `None`.**
