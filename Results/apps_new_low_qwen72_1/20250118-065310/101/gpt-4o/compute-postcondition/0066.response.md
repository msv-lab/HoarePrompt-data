The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `m` must still be greater than `j`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is 1
- `m` must be greater than 1

All other variables (`n`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0**
