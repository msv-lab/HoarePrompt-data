Postcondition: ***`left` is less than or equal to `right`. The current value of `i` is either `top` or `bottom`, or the current value of `j` is either `left` or `right`. If `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, then the element at position `[i][j]` in the `result` array is updated to `'+'`. Otherwise, the element at `[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
