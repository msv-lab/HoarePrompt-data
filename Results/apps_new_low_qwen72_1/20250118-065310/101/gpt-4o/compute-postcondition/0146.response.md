To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `for` loop can start its first iteration.

Given the loop head:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables `j`, `left`, and `right` are involved in the loop head.
2. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if `range(left, right + 1)` produces a non-empty sequence. This means that `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen.
- `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a 'w'.
- `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a 'w'.
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w'.
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w'.
- `frame_height` is (bottom - top + 1).
- `frame_width` is (right - left + 1).
- Both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2.
- `result` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters from the corresponding string in `screen`.
- `i` is `top`.
- `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. This ensures that the range `range(left, right + 1)` is not empty.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state must be:
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
- All other given conditions must hold true as they do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a 'w', `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a 'w', `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w', `right` is the largest column index of any 'w', `frame_height` is (bottom - top + 1), `frame_width` is (right - left + 1), both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters from the corresponding string in `screen`, `i` is `top`, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, and `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.**
