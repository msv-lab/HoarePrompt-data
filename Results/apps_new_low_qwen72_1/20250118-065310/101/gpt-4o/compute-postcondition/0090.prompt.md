Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`. `j` will be equal to `m` after the loop ends. `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if screen[i][j] == 'w':
        if top is None:
            top = bottom = i
            left = right = j
        else:
            if i < top:
                top = i
            if i > bottom:
                bottom = i
            if j < left:
                left = j
            if j > right:
                right = j


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `screen[0][0]` is `'w'`, and `top` is `None`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to 0. Otherwise, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is 0, `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`. Additionally, if `i` (which is 0) is less than `top`, then `top` is set to 0, and if `i` (which is 0) is greater than `bottom`, `bottom` is updated to 0. If `j` (which is 0) is less than `left`, `left` is updated to 0, and if `j` (which is 0) is greater than `right`, `right` is updated to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, then `left` is 1. If `top` is `None`, `right` is 1. If `j` > `right`, then `right` is updated to 1. If `j` â‰¤ `right`, the state of `right` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, then `left` is 1, `right` is 2, and if `j < left`, then `left` is 2. If `j > right`, then `right` is updated to 1, otherwise `right` remains unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, the state of `left` and `right` remains unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
