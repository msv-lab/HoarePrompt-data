The value of `bottom` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1. Since `i` is less than `top` (both are 1), `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged (all are 1). The other conditions and variable values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1.**
