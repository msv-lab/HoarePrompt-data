To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`.
- There is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.
- `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`.
- `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`.
- `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`.
- `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`.
- `j` will be equal to `m` after the loop ends.
- `i` is 0.

Loop statement:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variables:**
   - The loop is controlled by the variable `j` and the range `m`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `0` to `m-1`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be within the range `0` to `m-1`.
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and `m` is at least 1, the loop will always execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute the first time if and only if `m` is at least 1 and `j` is 0. The other variables (`n`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `i`) do not directly affect the loop's initial execution but are part of the overall program state.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**.
