The code initializes four variables (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) to `None`. These variables were previously undefined. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, top = None, bottom = None, left = None, right = None**
