The provided code snippet updates the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` based on the values of `i` and `j`.

- The first line sets `top` and `bottom` to the value of `i`, which is 1.
- The second line sets `left` and `right` to the value of `j`, which is 2.

Since the initial conditions state that `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2, and the code explicitly sets `top` and `bottom` to `i` and `left` and `right` to `j`, the final values of these variables are as follows:

- `top` is set to 1.
- `bottom` is set to 1.
- `left` is set to 2.
- `right` is set to 2.

No other variables are affected by the code, and the conditions regarding `screen` and the characters within it do not change the values of the variables being updated.

Output State: **n is greater than 1, m is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, i is 1, j is 2, top is 1, bottom is 1, left is 2, right is 2**
