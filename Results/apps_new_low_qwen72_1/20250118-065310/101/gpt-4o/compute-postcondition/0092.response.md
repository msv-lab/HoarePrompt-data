To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop can start executing. The loop in question is:

```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the value `m`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. This is because `range(m)` will generate a sequence of integers from 0 to `m-1`, and this sequence will be empty if `m` is 0 or negative.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `m`.
- `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`.
- `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`.
- `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`.
- `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`.

### Required State for Loop Execution:
- For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. Since `m` is given to be in the range \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), it is already guaranteed that `m` is greater than 0.
- The variable `j` in the loop head will start from 0 and iterate up to `m-1`.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that `m` is greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given condition \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\). The initial value of `j` is not relevant for the loop to start, as it will be set to 0 by the `range(m)` function.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`**.
