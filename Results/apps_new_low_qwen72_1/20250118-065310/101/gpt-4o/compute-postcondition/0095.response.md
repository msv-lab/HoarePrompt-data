The provided code snippet sets the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` based on the initial values of `i` and `j`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, these variables are all set to these values, effectively initializing the bounds of a region defined by the indices of `'w'` characters in the `screen`.

- `top` and `bottom` are both set to `i`, which is 1.
- `left` and `right` are both set to `j`, which is 0.

The initial conditions also mention that `screen[1][0]` is `'w'`, which aligns with the new values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. This means that the bounds initially cover the position of this `'w'` character.

Therefore, the final state after executing the code snippet is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `screen[1][0]` is `'w'`**.
