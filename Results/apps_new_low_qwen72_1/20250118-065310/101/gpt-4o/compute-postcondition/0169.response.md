The code snippet assigns the character `'+'` to the element in the `result` list at the index `[i][j]`. The value of `j` is already `j + 1` from the initial state. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `j + 1`, `result[i][j]` is `'+'`**
