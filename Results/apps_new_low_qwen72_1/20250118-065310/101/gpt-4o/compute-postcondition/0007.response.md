Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `top` is not `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, `j` is 0, the character at position `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, and the current value of `i` is less than the value of `top`.***
