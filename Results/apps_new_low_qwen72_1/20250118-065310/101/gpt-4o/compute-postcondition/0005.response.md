The provided code snippet initializes the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` with the values of `i` and `j`. Given the initial state, we can determine the final state after executing these lines.

Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`
- `top` is `None`
- `bottom` is `None`
- `left` is `None`
- `right` is `None`
- `j` is 0
- The character at position `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`
- The current value of `top` is `None`

Code Execution:
- The first line `top = bottom = i` sets both `top` and `bottom` to the value of `i`.
- The second line `left = right = j` sets both `left` and `right` to the value of `j`.

Since `j` is 0, `left` and `right` are both set to 0. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it must be a valid index for the `screen` list, so `top` and `bottom` are both set to this value.

Final State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`
- `top` is `i`
- `bottom` is `i`
- `left` is 0
- `right` is 0
- `j` is 0
- The character at position `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`

Output State: **n is greater than 0, m is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, top is i, bottom is i, left is 0, right is 0, j is 0, the character at position screen[i][j] is 'w'**
