Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 0 or 1. If `j` > `right`, then `right` is updated to 1. If `j` â‰¤ `right`, the state remains unchanged.***
