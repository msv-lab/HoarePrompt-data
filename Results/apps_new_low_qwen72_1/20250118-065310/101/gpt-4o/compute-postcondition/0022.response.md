The provided code snippet sets the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` based on the current values of `i` and `j`. Given the initial conditions, the code will execute as follows:

- `top` and `bottom` are both set to the value of `i`.
- `left` and `right` are both set to the value of `j`.

Since `j` is given as 1, `left` and `right` will both be set to 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `screen` are not changed by this code snippet. Therefore, the final state will include these variables with their initial values, along with the updated values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, i is i, j is 1, top is i, bottom is i, left is 1, right is 1**
