The code snippet `result = [list(row) for row in screen]` creates a new list of lists called `result`, where each inner list is a list representation of each string in `screen`. This means that each string in `screen` is converted into a list of characters.

Since the initial state specifies that `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each consisting of exactly `m` characters, and each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, the `result` will be a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), m is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, top is the smallest index of any row containing a 'w', bottom is the largest index of any row containing a 'w', left is the smallest column index of any 'w', right is the largest column index of any 'w', frame_height is (bottom - top + 1), frame_width is (right - left + 1), and both frame_height and frame_width are greater than or equal to 2, result is a list of n lists, each containing m characters from the corresponding string in screen.**
