To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information:

- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters, and each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`.
- There is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.
- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `None`.

The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n):
```

For this loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `n > 0`).

Given that `n` is already specified to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The other variables (`m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) do not directly affect whether the loop starts, but they are part of the initial state.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop will execute the first time, is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`**.
