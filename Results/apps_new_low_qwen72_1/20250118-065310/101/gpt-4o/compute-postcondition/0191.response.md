Postcondition: ***`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `left + 2`, `i` is `top + 2`, `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged, `n`, `m`, `screen`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged. If `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right`, and if `result[i][j]` was initially '.', it is now '+'. Otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
