Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `i < top`, then `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged (all are 1). If `i >= top`, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` also remain unchanged (all are 1).***
