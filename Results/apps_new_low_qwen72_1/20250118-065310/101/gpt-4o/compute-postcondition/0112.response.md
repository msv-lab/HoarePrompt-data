The provided code snippet sets `top` and `bottom` to the value of `i`, and `left` and `right` to the value of `j`. Given the initial conditions, we can determine the final state as follows:

- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `m` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` remains a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` remains 1.
- `top` is set to 1 (the value of `i`).
- `bottom` is set to 1 (the value of `i`).
- `left` is set to 1 (the value of `j`).
- `right` is set to 1 (the value of `j`).

Output State: **n is greater than 1, m is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), screen is a list of n strings, each string consists of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w', and there is at least one 'w' character in the screen, i is 1, j is 1, top is 1, bottom is 1, left is 1, right is 1**.
