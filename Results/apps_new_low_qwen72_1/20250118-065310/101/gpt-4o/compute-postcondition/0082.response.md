The value of `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 0. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1 if `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, `right` is 1 if `top` is `None` or if `j` > `right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged. If `i` < `top`, the state of the variables remains as described above.**
