The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of exactly `m` characters where each character is either '.' or 'w'. There is at least one 'w' character in the `screen`.

- Case_1: The program returns -1.
- Case_2: The program returns -1.
- Case_3: The program returns `result`, which is a 2D list where all elements at positions `[i][j]` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right` have been updated to '+' if they were initially '.', and all other elements remain unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen` representing a grid. It returns -1 in certain unspecified cases (Case_1 and Case_2), and in another case (Case_3), it returns a modified version of `screen` where the border elements that were initially '.' are changed to '+', while all other elements remain unchanged.
