Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, then: if `top` is `None`, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 1; if `top` is not `None` and `j` > `right`, `left` is 1, `right` is 2, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 1; if `top` is not `None` and `j` <= `right`, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain 1. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged (i.e., `left` is 1, `right` is 2, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 1).***
