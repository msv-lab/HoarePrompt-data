Output State: **After the loop has finished executing, the variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged. The variable `i` has the value `bottom + 1`. All elements in `result` at positions `[i][j]` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right` will be updated to '+' if they were initially '.', and all other elements in `result` remain unchanged.**
