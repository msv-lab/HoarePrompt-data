The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `left`, and `right`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `left` and `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1`, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `j` must still be less than or equal to `right`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `left` remains the same.
- `right` remains the same.

State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `j + 1`, `right` is `right`**
