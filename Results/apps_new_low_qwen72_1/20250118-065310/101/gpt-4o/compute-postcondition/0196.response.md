Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2000\), and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, with at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.

The function determines the bounding box of all `'w'` characters in the `screen` and then modifies the `screen` to create a frame around this bounding box by changing certain `'.'` characters to `'+'`.

1. **Case_1**: If no `'w'` characters are found in the `screen` (though this case is contradictory given the precondition that there is at least one `'w'`), the function returns `-1`.
2. **Case_2**: If the bounding box of `'w'` characters is less than 2x2 (i.e., either the height or width of the bounding box is less than 2), the function returns `-1`.
3. **Case_3**: If the bounding box is valid (at least 2x2), the function returns a modified version of `screen` where the border elements (top, bottom, left, and right edges of the bounding box) that were initially `'.'` are changed to `'+'`, while all other elements remain unchanged.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the `screen` contains only one `'w'` character, the function will return `-1` because the bounding box would be 1x1.
- If the `screen` is entirely filled with `'w'` characters, the function will still return a valid result, modifying the border of the entire `screen` to `'+'`.
- If the `screen` has multiple `'w'` characters but they are all aligned in a single row or column, the function will return `-1` because the bounding box would be 1xN or Nx1, respectively.

Summary:
- The function modifies the `screen` to create a frame around the bounding box of `'w'` characters, returning the modified `screen` if the bounding box is at least 2x2. Otherwise, it returns `-1`. **
