The code snippet `right = j` updates the value of `right` to the current value of `j`. Since `j` is specified to be greater than `right` in the initial state, this assignment effectively updates `right` to the new maximum column index of any `'w'`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`
- `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`
- `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`
- `left` is 0
- `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0
- The current value of `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`
- If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 0, and `top` is not `None`
- If `i` is greater than `bottom`, `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`
- If `j` is less than `left`, `left` is updated to 0
- The current value of `j` is greater than `right`

After executing the code snippet:
- `right` is updated to the current value of `j`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is 0, `right` is `j`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 0, and `top` is not `None`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`. If `j` is less than `left`, `left` is updated to 0.**
