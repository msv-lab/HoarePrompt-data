To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions that affect the loop's execution based on the provided state.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.
- `top` is `None`.
- `bottom` is `None`.
- `left` is `None`.
- `right` is `None`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variables**:
   - The loop iterates over the range of `m`.
   - The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `m` is already given as an integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\). This ensures that `m` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `n`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not directly involved in the loop condition. However, they provide context for the loop's purpose, but they do not affect whether the loop will execute the first time.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `m` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state, `m` is already ensured to be within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), which means `m` is at least 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, `j` is 0**
