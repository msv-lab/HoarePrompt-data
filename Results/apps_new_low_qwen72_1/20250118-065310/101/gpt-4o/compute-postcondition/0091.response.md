The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`.**
