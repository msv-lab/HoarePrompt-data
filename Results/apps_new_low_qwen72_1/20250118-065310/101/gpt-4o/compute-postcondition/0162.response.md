To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either '.' or 'w'.
- There is at least one 'w' character in the screen.
- `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a 'w'.
- `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a 'w'.
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w'.
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w'.
- `frame_height` is (bottom - top + 1).
- `frame_width` is (right - left + 1).
- Both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2.
- `result` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters from the corresponding string in `screen`.
- `i` is `top + 1`.
- `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`.
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `left` to `right + 1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(left, right + 1)` must contain at least one element.
- This means that `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

### State:
**`left` must be less than or equal to `right`**
