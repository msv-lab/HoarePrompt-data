Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1. If `top` is `None`, `left` and `right` are both 1, and `top` and `bottom` are 1. If `top` is not `None`, `left` is 1. If `j > right`, `right` is updated to 1, and `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged. If `j <= right`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
