The value of `bottom` is updated to be equal to `i`. Since `i` is 1, `bottom` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If `i < top`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. If `top` was initially `None`, then `left` and `right` are both 0. Otherwise, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'` (or 0 if `j` is less than `left`), and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'` (or `j` if `j` is greater than `right`). `bottom` is 1.**
