Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'`, and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`. The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are updated based on the positions of `'w'` characters found in the first row of `screen` as the loop iterates through each column. If no `'w'` is found in the first row, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will retain their initial values (or be set to 0 if `top` was initially `None`).**
