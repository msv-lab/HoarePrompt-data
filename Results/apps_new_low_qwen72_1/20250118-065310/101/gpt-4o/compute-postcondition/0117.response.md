The code snippet `left = j` updates the value of `left` to the current value of `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`.
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- If `i < top`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
- If `top` was initially `None`, then `left` and `right` are both 0.
- Otherwise, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'` (or 0 if `j` is less than `left`), and `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'` (or `j` if `j` is greater than `right`).
- If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to 1.

After executing the code snippet `left = j`:
- `left` is updated to the value of `j`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `left` is 1. If `i < top`, then `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged. If `top` was initially `None`, then `right` is 0. Otherwise, `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'` (or `j` if `j` is greater than `right`). If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to 1.**
