The code snippet `right = j` updates the value of `right` to the current value of `j`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1. Therefore, `right` is updated to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` remains unchanged.**
