The code snippet `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to `right`. Given that `j` is greater than `right` in the initial state, this updates the value of `right` to be equal to `j`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than the original `right`, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is the smallest column index of any `'w'` (or 0 if `j` is less than `left`), `right` is equal to `j`, and the character at position `screen[1][0]` is `'w'`.**
