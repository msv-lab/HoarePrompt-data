The value of `left` is updated to the current value of `j`. Given that `j` is 0 and `left` was previously the smallest column index of any `'w'`, the new value of `left` is now 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `top` is the smallest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `bottom` is the largest index of any row containing a `'w'`, `left` is 0, `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 0, and `top` is not `None`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`. Additionally, the current value of `j` is less than `left`.**
