The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is 0, `top` becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 < m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0**
