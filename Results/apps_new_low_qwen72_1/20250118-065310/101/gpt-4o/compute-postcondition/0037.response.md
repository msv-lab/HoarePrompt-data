The value of `bottom` is updated to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`, `j` is 2, `m` must be at least 2, `top` is set to the row index of the first `'w'` found (or `None` if no `'w'` has been found yet). If `i` is less than `top`, `top` is updated to `i`. `bottom` is `i`, `left` is set to 1 if a `'w'` has been found, `right` is set to 1 if a `'w'` has been found.**
