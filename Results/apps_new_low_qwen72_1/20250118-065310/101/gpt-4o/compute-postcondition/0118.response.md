Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string consists of exactly `m` characters where each character is either `'.'` or `'w'`, and there is at least one `'w'` character in the `screen`. `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If `j < left`, then `left` is 1, `right` is 0 if `top` was initially `None`, otherwise `right` is the largest column index of any `'w'` (or `j` if `j` is greater than `right`). If `i < top`, then `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged. If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to 1.***
