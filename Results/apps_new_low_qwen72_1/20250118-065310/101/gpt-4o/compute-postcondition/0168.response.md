To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- The condition for updating the `result` array: If `i` is either `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is either `left` or `right`, and if `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, then the element at position `[i][j]` in the `result` array is updated to `'+'`. Otherwise, the element at `[i][j]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `j`, `left`, and `right`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range from `left` to `right + 1`.
3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the last value in the range `[left, right]`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue to execute if `j` is still less than or equal to `right`.

### Adjusted State:
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

### Final State:
Since `j` is incremented by 1 and the loop will continue to execute if `j` is still within the range `[left, right + 1]`, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `j + 1`**
