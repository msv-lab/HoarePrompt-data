Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is M, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `t` is a list that must have at least one element, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to `M - (M // subtask_time) * subtask_time` and `subtasks_solved` is updated to `(M // subtask_time)`. Otherwise, the values of `remaining_time` and `subtasks_solved` remain unchanged.***
