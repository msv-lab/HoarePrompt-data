The only variable in the loop head is `complete_tasks`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `complete_tasks` relative to `n + 1`. If `complete_tasks` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `complete_tasks` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `complete_tasks` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is the remainder of M after subtracting the total time used for all subtasks solved, `subtasks_solved` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k), `max_points` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k)**
