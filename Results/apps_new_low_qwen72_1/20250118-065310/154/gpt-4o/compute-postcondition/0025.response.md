Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`, `points` is `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is `M - total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is `min(subtasks_solved, n * k)`, `t` must have at least one element, and the remaining time (`remaining_time`) is greater than or equal to the time required for a subtask (`subtask_time`).***
