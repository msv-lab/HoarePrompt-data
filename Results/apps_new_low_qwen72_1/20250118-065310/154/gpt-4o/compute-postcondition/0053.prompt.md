Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is an integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), t is a list of k integers (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000), total_time_per_task is the sum of the elements in t, max_points is 0
Code of the loop:
for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
    time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
    if time_used > M:
        break
    points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
    remaining_time = M - time_used
    subtasks_solved = 0
    for subtask_time in t:
        if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
            max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
            subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
            remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
    subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
    max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), complete_tasks is 0, time_used is 0, points is 0, remaining_time is the remainder of M after subtracting the total time used for all subtasks solved, subtasks_solved is min(subtasks_solved, n * k), max_points is min(subtasks_solved, n * k)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), complete_tasks is 1, time_used is total_time_per_task, points is k + 1, remaining_time is the amount of time left after all possible subtasks have been solved within the available remaining_time, subtasks_solved is min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k), max_points is max(min(subtasks_solved, n * k), points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k))
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), complete_tasks is 2, time_used is 2 * total_time_per_task, points is 2 * (k + 1), remaining_time is the initial remaining_time minus the total time used for all subtasks solved, subtasks_solved is min(subtasks_solved, (n - 2) * k), max_points is max(max(min(subtasks_solved, n * k), points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k)), points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - 2) * k)), t may be empty or have remaining elements


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
