The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. Since the values of the variables are not modified by the `break` statement itself, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is the remainder of M after subtracting the total time used for all subtasks solved, `subtasks_solved` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k), `max_points` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
