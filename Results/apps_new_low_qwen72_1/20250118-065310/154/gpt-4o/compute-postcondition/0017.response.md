Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is the remainder of `M` after subtracting the total time used for all subtasks solved, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that can be completed given the remaining time `M` and the subtask times in `t`. The loop will execute for each element in `t` as long as `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to the current `subtask_time`. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time` for any iteration, the loop will stop executing without further changes to `remaining_time` or `subtasks_solved`.**
