The provided code snippet updates several variables based on the initial state. Here's the analysis and the resulting final state:

1. The line `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)` recalculates the value of `points` based on the product of `complete_tasks` and `(k + 1)`. Given that `complete_tasks` is 2 and `points` is initially `k + 1`, this line sets `points` to `2 * (k + 1)`.

2. The line `remaining_time = M - time_used` calculates the remaining time by subtracting `time_used` from `M`. Given that `time_used` is `2 * total_time_per_task`, the new `remaining_time` is `M - 2 * total_time_per_task`.

3. The line `subtasks_solved = 0` resets `subtasks_solved` to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had.

Combining these changes, the final state is:

Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), complete_tasks is 2, time_used is 2 * total_time_per_task, points is 2 * (k + 1), remaining_time is M - 2 * total_time_per_task, subtasks_solved is 0, max_points is max(min(subtasks_solved, n * k), points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k))**
