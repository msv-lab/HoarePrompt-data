Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is 2 * `total_time_per_task`, `points` is 2 * (k + 1), `remaining_time` is M - 2 * `total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is max(min(`subtasks_solved`, n * k), `points` + min(`subtasks_solved`, (n - 1) * k)), `t` is an iterable with at least one element, and the `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
