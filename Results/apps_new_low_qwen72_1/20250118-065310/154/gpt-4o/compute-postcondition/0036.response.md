The only object in the loop head is the variable `complete_tasks` and the value `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `complete_tasks` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `complete_tasks` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45. For the loop to execute one more time, `complete_tasks` should be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 45.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is total_time_per_task, `points` is k + 1, `remaining_time` is the amount of time left after all possible subtasks have been solved within the available remaining_time, `subtasks_solved` is min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k), `max_points` is max(min(subtasks_solved, n * k), points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k))**
