The provided code snippet modifies several variables based on their initial values and the operations performed. Here's the analysis:

- The first line sets `points` to the product of `complete_tasks` and `(k + 1)`. Given that `complete_tasks` is 1, `points` becomes `1 * (k + 1)`, which simplifies to `k + 1`.
- The second line recalculates `remaining_time` as `M - time_used`. Since `time_used` is initially set to `total_time_per_task`, `remaining_time` becomes `M - total_time_per_task`.
- The third line resets `subtasks_solved` to 0, overriding its previous value.

No other variables are directly modified by the code. Therefore, the final state reflects these changes while keeping the values of `n`, `total_time_per_task`, and `M` unchanged, as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), complete_tasks is 1, time_used is total_time_per_task, points is k + 1, remaining_time is M - total_time_per_task, subtasks_solved is 0, max_points is min(subtasks_solved, n * k)**
