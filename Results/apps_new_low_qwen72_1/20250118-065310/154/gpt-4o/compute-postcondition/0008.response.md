Postcondition: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is M, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `t` is a list that must have at least one element, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`. The current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.**
