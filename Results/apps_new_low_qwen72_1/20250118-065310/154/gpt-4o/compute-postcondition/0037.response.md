The value of `time_used` is updated to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. Given that `complete_tasks` is 2 and `total_time_per_task` is already defined as `total_time_per_task`, the new value of `time_used` is `2 * total_time_per_task`.

Other variables (`n`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved`, `max_points`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is `2 * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is the amount of time left after all possible subtasks have been solved within the available remaining_time, `subtasks_solved` is `min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k)`, `max_points` is `max(min(subtasks_solved, n * k), points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k))`**
