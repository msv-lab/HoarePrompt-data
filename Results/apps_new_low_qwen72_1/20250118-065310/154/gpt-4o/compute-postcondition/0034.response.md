Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`, `points` is `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is the amount of time left after all possible subtasks have been solved within the available `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that could be solved given the `remaining_time` and the subtask times in `t`, and `max_points` is `min(subtasks_solved, n * k)`. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `t` and `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to the current `subtask_time`. If `t` is empty or `remaining_time` is less than any `subtask_time`, the loop will not execute.**
