Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is `2 * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is the amount of time left after all possible subtasks have been solved within the available `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved` is `min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k)`, `max_points` is `max(min(subtasks_solved, n * k), points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k))`. If `time_used` > `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
