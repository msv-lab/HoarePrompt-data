To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, let's follow the steps outlined in the instructions:

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**:
  - `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
  - `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45)
  - `M` is an integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9)
  - `t` is a list of `k` integers (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000)
  - `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`
  - `max_points` is 0

- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
      time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
      if time_used > M:
          break
      points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
      remaining_time = M - time_used
      subtasks_solved = 0
      for subtask_time in t:
          if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
              max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
              subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
              remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
      subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
      max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
  ```

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain constant throughout the loop.

- **Changing Variables**:
  - `complete_tasks` increments from 0 to `n`.
  - `time_used` is calculated as `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
  - `points` is calculated as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
  - `remaining_time` is calculated as `M - time_used`.
  - `subtasks_solved` is calculated based on the remaining time and the subtask times.
  - `max_points` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop iterates over `complete_tasks` from 0 to `n`.
- For each iteration, it calculates the `time_used` and checks if it exceeds `M`. If it does, the loop breaks.
- If the `time_used` is within `M`, it calculates the `points` and `remaining_time`.
- It then iterates over the subtask times to determine how many subtasks can be solved within the `remaining_time`.
- The `subtasks_solved` is capped at `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.
- Finally, `max_points` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The loop will stop either when `complete_tasks` reaches `n + 1` or when `time_used` exceeds `M`.
- The `max_points` will be the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` across all iterations where `time_used` is within `M`.

### Final Output State
- **Final Values**:
  - `n` remains an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
  - `k` remains an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45)
  - `M` remains an integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9)
  - `t` remains a list of `k` integers (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000)
  - `complete_tasks` will be the last value before the loop breaks, which could be any value from 0 to `n` depending on when `time_used` exceeds `M`.
  - `time_used` will be `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
  - `points` will be `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
  - `remaining_time` will be `M - time_used`.
  - `subtasks_solved` will be the number of subtasks solved within the `remaining_time`, capped at `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.
  - `max_points` will be the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` across all valid iterations.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
- The loop will execute at least once if `M` is greater than or equal to `total_time_per_task`.
- The loop will not execute if `M` is less than `total_time_per_task`.

### Output State
Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is an integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), t is a list of k integers (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000), complete_tasks is the last value before the loop breaks (0 ≤ complete_tasks ≤ n), time_used is complete_tasks * total_time_per_task, points is complete_tasks * (k + 1), remaining_time is M - time_used, subtasks_solved is the number of subtasks solved within the remaining_time, capped at (n - complete_tasks) * k, max_points is the maximum value of points + subtasks_solved across all valid iterations.**
