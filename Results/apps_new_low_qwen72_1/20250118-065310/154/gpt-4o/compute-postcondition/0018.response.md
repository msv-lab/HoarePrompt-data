The provided code snippet modifies the variables `subtasks_solved` and `max_points` based on the conditions specified. Here's the analysis and the final output state:

1. The first line updates `subtasks_solved` to the minimum of its current value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. This ensures that `subtasks_solved` does not exceed the product of the remaining tasks (`n - complete_tasks`) and a factor `k`.

2. The second line updates `max_points` to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and the updated `subtasks_solved`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
- `complete_tasks` is 0
- `time_used` is 0
- `points` is 0
- `remaining_time` is the remainder of `M` after subtracting the total time used for all subtasks solved
- `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that can be completed given the remaining time `M` and the subtask times in `t`
- `max_points` is not explicitly defined, so we assume it starts at 0

Let's calculate the final state:

1. **Update `subtasks_solved`:**
   - `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`
   - Since `complete_tasks` is 0, this simplifies to `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, n * k)`

2. **Update `max_points`:**
   - `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`
   - Since `points` is 0, this simplifies to `max_points = max(max_points, subtasks_solved)`

Since `max_points` starts at 0, the final value of `max_points` will be the updated value of `subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), complete_tasks is 0, time_used is 0, points is 0, remaining_time is the remainder of M after subtracting the total time used for all subtasks solved, subtasks_solved is min(subtasks_solved, n * k), max_points is min(subtasks_solved, n * k)**
