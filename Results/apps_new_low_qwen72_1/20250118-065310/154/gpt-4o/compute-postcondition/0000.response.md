The provided code snippet initializes two variables: `total_time_per_task` and `max_points`.

- The first line calculates the sum of the elements in the list `t` and assigns this sum to the variable `total_time_per_task`.
- The second line sets the variable `max_points` to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `k`, and `M` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9.
- `t` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer `t_j` satisfies 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000.

After executing the code:
- `total_time_per_task` is set to the sum of the elements in the list `t`.
- `max_points` is set to 0.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is an integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), t is a list of k integers (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000), total_time_per_task is the sum of the elements in t, max_points is 0**
