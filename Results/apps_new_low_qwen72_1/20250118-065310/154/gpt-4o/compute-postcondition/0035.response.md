The provided code snippet modifies the variables `subtasks_solved` and `max_points` based on the conditions specified. Let's analyze the combined effect of both lines:

1. The first line updates `subtasks_solved` to the minimum of its current value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. This ensures that `subtasks_solved` does not exceed the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved given the remaining tasks and the value of `k`.

2. The second line updates `max_points` to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and the updated `subtasks_solved`. This ensures that `max_points` reflects the best possible score achievable given the current state of the program.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
- `complete_tasks` is 1
- `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`
- `points` is `k + 1`
- `remaining_time` is the amount of time left after all possible subtasks have been solved within the available `remaining_time`
- `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that could be solved given the `remaining_time` and the subtask times in `t`
- `max_points` is `min(subtasks_solved, n * k)`

Let's combine the effects of the code snippet:

- `subtasks_solved` is updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.
- `max_points` is updated to `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`.

Since `complete_tasks` is 1, the expression `(n - complete_tasks) * k` simplifies to `(n - 1) * k`. Therefore, `subtasks_solved` becomes `min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k)`.

The final value of `max_points` will be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and the updated `subtasks_solved`.

Output State:
**n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), complete_tasks is 1, time_used is total_time_per_task, points is k + 1, remaining_time is the amount of time left after all possible subtasks have been solved within the available remaining_time, subtasks_solved is min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k), max_points is max(min(subtasks_solved, n * k), points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - 1) * k))**
