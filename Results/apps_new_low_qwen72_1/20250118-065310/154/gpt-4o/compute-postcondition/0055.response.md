The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45.
- `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9.
- `t` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer `t_j` satisfies 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000.

The function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` across all valid iterations, where:
- `points` is calculated as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
- `subtasks_solved` is the number of subtasks solved within the `remaining_time`, capped at `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.
- `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, and `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
