The code calculates the value of `time_used` by multiplying `complete_tasks` with `total_time_per_task`. Since `complete_tasks` is 0, the result of this multiplication will be 0, regardless of the value of `total_time_per_task`. Therefore, `time_used` is set to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0**
