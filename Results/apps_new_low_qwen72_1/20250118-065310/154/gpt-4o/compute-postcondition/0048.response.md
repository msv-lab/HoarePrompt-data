The only objects in the loop head are `subtask_time` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `t` having at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again. The variable `subtask_time` will be set to the next element in the list `t`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is 2 * `total_time_per_task`, `points` is 2 * (k + 1), `remaining_time` is (M - 2 * `total_time_per_task`) - ((M - 2 * `total_time_per_task`) // T) * T, `subtasks_solved` is (M - 2 * `total_time_per_task`) // T, `max_points` is max(min((M - 2 * `total_time_per_task`) // T, n * k), `points` + min((M - 2 * `total_time_per_task`) // T, (n - 1) * k)), `t` must have at least two elements, `subtask_time` is the second element in `t`**
