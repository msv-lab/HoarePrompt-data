To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `subtask_time` and the iterable `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
- `complete_tasks` is 1
- `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`
- `points` is `k + 1`
- `remaining_time` is `M - total_time_per_task - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`
- `subtasks_solved` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`
- `max_points` is `min(remaining_time // subtask_time, n * k)`
- If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is updated to `M - total_time_per_task - 2 * (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time` and `subtasks_solved` is updated to `2 * (remaining_time // subtask_time)`

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `subtask_time` needs to be updated to the next value in the iterable `t`.

Let's assume `t` is a list of integers representing different subtask times. After the previous iteration, `subtask_time` was set to the current element in `t`. For the next iteration, `subtask_time` should be set to the next element in `t`.

Since the loop head only involves `subtask_time` and `t`, and the loop condition is based on the presence of elements in `t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `subtask_time`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`, `points` is `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is `M - total_time_per_task - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_points` is `min(remaining_time // subtask_time, n * k)`, `subtask_time` is the next value in `t`**
