Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`, `points` is `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is `M - total_time_per_task - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `(remaining_time // subtask_time)`, `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, and `max_points` is updated to `min((remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time) // subtask_time, n * k)`. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, the variables retain their values as described in the precondition.***
