Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`, `points` is `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is `M - total_time_per_task`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to `M - total_time_per_task - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `max_points` is updated to `min(remaining_time // subtask_time, n * k)`. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` remains 0 and `max_points` remains `min(0, n * k)`. `t` must have at least one element.***
