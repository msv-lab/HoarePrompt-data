Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is `total_time_per_task`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is the remainder of M after subtracting the total time used for all subtasks solved, `subtasks_solved` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k), `max_points` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k). If `time_used` > M, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
