To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
- `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45)
- `M` is an integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9)
- `t` is a list of `k` integers (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000)
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`
- `max_points` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` inclusive, which means it will run `n + 1` times.
- The loop variable `complete_tasks` will take on values from 0 to `n`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute the First Time:
- The loop will execute the first time if the range `range(n + 1)` is not empty.
- For `range(n + 1)` to be non-empty, `n + 1` must be greater than 0.
- Since `n` is an integer and 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `n + 1` will always be at least 2, which is greater than 0.

### Initial State:
- `complete_tasks` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

### Final State:
- The loop will execute because `n + 1` is always greater than 0 given the constraints on `n`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute the first time if `n` is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 45). The initial state of the loop head variables must be:
- `complete_tasks` is 0
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0**
