Output State: **The program returns max_points, which is the maximum value of points + subtasks_solved across all valid iterations, where points is complete_tasks * (k + 1), and subtasks_solved is the number of subtasks solved within the remaining_time, capped at (n - complete_tasks) * k. The remaining_time is M - time_used, and time_used is complete_tasks * total_time_per_task.**
