The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. It calculates the maximum points achievable by completing tasks and their subtasks within a given time limit `M`. The function iterates over possible numbers of complete tasks (from 0 to `n`), calculates the total time used for these tasks, and then determines the remaining time available for solving subtasks. For each iteration, it computes the points from the completed tasks and the number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time, ensuring that the total number of subtasks solved does not exceed the remaining subtasks available. The function returns the maximum points achievable, which is the sum of points from complete tasks and the number of subtasks solved. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `M` is too small to complete any tasks or subtasks, or where `t` contains very large values, leading to no subtasks being solvable within the remaining time.
