You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. It calculates the maximum points achievable by completing tasks and their subtasks within a given time limit `M`. The function iterates over possible numbers of complete tasks (from 0 to `n`), calculates the total time used for these tasks, and then determines the remaining time available for solving subtasks. For each iteration, it computes the points from the completed tasks and the number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time, ensuring that the total number of subtasks solved does not exceed the remaining subtasks available. The function returns the maximum points achievable, which is the sum of points from complete tasks and the number of subtasks solved. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `M` is too small to complete any tasks or subtasks, or where `t` contains very large values, leading to no subtasks being solvable within the remaining time.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input and splits it into the necessary components: `n` (number of tasks), `k` (number of subtasks per task), `M` (total available time), and `t` (time required for each subtask).

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `total_time_per_task` to the sum of times for all subtasks in one task. This is used to calculate the time required to complete a full task.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program iterates over the number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) from 0 to `n`.
   - For each value of `complete_tasks`, it calculates the time used (`time_used`) and the points earned from completing those tasks (`points`).
   - If the time used exceeds `M`, the loop breaks as it is no longer feasible to complete more tasks.

4. **Remaining Time and Subtasks**:
   - The remaining time after completing the `complete_tasks` is calculated.
   - The program then tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time.
   - It iterates over the subtask times and checks if the remaining time is sufficient to solve more subtasks.
   - The number of subtasks solved is updated, and the remaining time is adjusted accordingly.

5. **Subtask Limit**:
   - The number of subtasks solved is limited to the maximum possible subtasks that can be solved without exceeding the number of remaining tasks (`(n - complete_tasks) * k`).

6. **Update Maximum Points**:
   - The program updates the maximum points (`max_points`) by adding the points from complete tasks and the points from the solved subtasks.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. It ensures that the total time does not exceed `M` and maximizes the points by solving as many complete tasks and subtasks as possible within the given time. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
