You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. It calculates the maximum points achievable by completing tasks and their subtasks within a given time limit `M`. The function iterates over possible numbers of complete tasks (from 0 to `n`), calculates the total time used for these tasks, and then determines the remaining time available for solving subtasks. For each iteration, it computes the points from the completed tasks and the number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time, ensuring that the total number of subtasks solved does not exceed the remaining subtasks available. The function returns the maximum points achievable, which is the sum of points from complete tasks and the number of subtasks solved. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `M` is too small to complete any tasks or subtasks, or where `t` contains very large values, leading to no subtasks being solvable within the remaining time.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program provided aims to solve the problem of maximizing the number of points Polycarp can earn within a given time limit \(M\). The approach taken in the function `func_1` is to iterate over the possible number of tasks that can be completely solved (from 0 to \(n\)), calculate the time used, and then determine how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `total_time_per_task` as the sum of times required to solve all subtasks of a single task. This is correct because solving all subtasks of any task will take the same amount of time regardless of which task it is.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Complete Tasks**: The loop `for complete_tasks in range(n + 1)` iterates over the number of tasks that can be fully completed. For each iteration, it calculates the time used (`time_used`) and the initial points (`points`) from these fully completed tasks.

3. **Calculating Remaining Time**: After accounting for the time used to complete the full tasks, the program calculates the remaining time available to solve additional subtasks.

4. **Solving Additional Subtasks**: The inner loop `for subtask_time in t:` attempts to solve as many instances of each subtask as possible with the remaining time. This is done by calculating how many times the current subtask can be solved within the remaining time and updating `subtasks_solved` and `remaining_time` accordingly.

5. **Adjusting Subtasks Solved**: The line `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)` ensures that the number of additional subtasks solved does not exceed the maximum possible number of unsolved subtasks in the remaining tasks.

6. **Updating Maximum Points**: Finally, the program updates `max_points` with the maximum value between the current `max_points` and the new points calculated.

The logic and implementation appear to correctly follow the requirements of the problem statement, ensuring that the solution is optimal and handles all edge cases appropriately.
