Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of maximizing the number of points Polycarp can earn by completing tasks and their subtasks within a given time limit `M`. The function `func_1` correctly follows the logic required to achieve this:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes the total time required to complete all subtasks of a single task (`total_time_per_task`) and sets `max_points` to 0.
2. **Iterating Over Possible Complete Tasks**: The function iterates over the number of complete tasks Polycarp can finish, from 0 to `n`.
3. **Calculating Time Used and Points from Complete Tasks**: For each possible number of complete tasks, it calculates the time used (`time_used`) and the points earned from these complete tasks (`points`).
4. **Handling Remaining Time**: If the time used exceeds `M`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it calculates the remaining time available for solving additional subtasks.
5. **Solving Subtasks**: It then iterates over the subtask times and determines how many subtasks can be solved within the remaining time, updating `subtasks_solved` and reducing the remaining time accordingly.
6. **Ensuring No Overcounting**: It ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the remaining subtasks available by using `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.
7. **Updating Maximum Points**: Finally, it updates `max_points` with the maximum value of the current points plus the number of subtasks solved.

The execution summary confirms that the function correctly handles the logic and edge cases, such as when `M` is too small to complete any tasks or when `t` contains large values.

Given this reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
