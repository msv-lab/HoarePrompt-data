Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input and splits it into the necessary components: `n` (number of tasks), `k` (number of subtasks per task), `M` (total available time), and `t` (time required for each subtask).

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `total_time_per_task` to the sum of times for all subtasks in one task. This is used to calculate the time required to complete a full task.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program iterates over the number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) from 0 to `n`.
   - For each value of `complete_tasks`, it calculates the time used (`time_used`) and the points earned from completing those tasks (`points`).
   - If the time used exceeds `M`, the loop breaks as it is no longer feasible to complete more tasks.

4. **Remaining Time and Subtasks**:
   - The remaining time after completing the `complete_tasks` is calculated.
   - The program then tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time.
   - It iterates over the subtask times and checks if the remaining time is sufficient to solve more subtasks.
   - The number of subtasks solved is updated, and the remaining time is adjusted accordingly.

5. **Subtask Limit**:
   - The number of subtasks solved is limited to the maximum possible subtasks that can be solved without exceeding the number of remaining tasks (`(n - complete_tasks) * k`).

6. **Update Maximum Points**:
   - The program updates the maximum points (`max_points`) by adding the points from complete tasks and the points from the solved subtasks.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. It ensures that the total time does not exceed `M` and maximizes the points by solving as many complete tasks and subtasks as possible within the given time. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
