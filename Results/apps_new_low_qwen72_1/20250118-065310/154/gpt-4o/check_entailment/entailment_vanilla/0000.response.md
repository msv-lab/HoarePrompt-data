Reasoning:  
The program provided aims to solve the problem of maximizing the number of points Polycarp can earn within a given time limit \(M\). The approach taken in the function `func_1` is to iterate over the possible number of tasks that can be completely solved (from 0 to \(n\)), calculate the time used, and then determine how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `total_time_per_task` as the sum of times required to solve all subtasks of a single task. This is correct because solving all subtasks of any task will take the same amount of time regardless of which task it is.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Complete Tasks**: The loop `for complete_tasks in range(n + 1)` iterates over the number of tasks that can be fully completed. For each iteration, it calculates the time used (`time_used`) and the initial points (`points`) from these fully completed tasks.

3. **Calculating Remaining Time**: After accounting for the time used to complete the full tasks, the program calculates the remaining time available to solve additional subtasks.

4. **Solving Additional Subtasks**: The inner loop `for subtask_time in t:` attempts to solve as many instances of each subtask as possible with the remaining time. This is done by calculating how many times the current subtask can be solved within the remaining time and updating `subtasks_solved` and `remaining_time` accordingly.

5. **Adjusting Subtasks Solved**: The line `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)` ensures that the number of additional subtasks solved does not exceed the maximum possible number of unsolved subtasks in the remaining tasks.

6. **Updating Maximum Points**: Finally, the program updates `max_points` with the maximum value between the current `max_points` and the new points calculated.

The logic and implementation appear to correctly follow the requirements of the problem statement, ensuring that the solution is optimal and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
