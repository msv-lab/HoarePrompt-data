Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is an integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), t is a list of k integers (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000), complete_tasks is the last value before the loop breaks (0 ≤ complete_tasks ≤ n), time_used is complete_tasks * total_time_per_task, points is complete_tasks * (k + 1), remaining_time is M - time_used, subtasks_solved is the number of subtasks solved within the remaining_time, capped at (n - complete_tasks) * k, max_points is the maximum value of points + subtasks_solved across all valid iterations.
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points, which is the maximum value of points + subtasks_solved across all valid iterations, where points is complete_tasks * (k + 1), and subtasks_solved is the number of subtasks solved within the remaining_time, capped at (n - complete_tasks) * k. The remaining_time is M - time_used, and time_used is complete_tasks * total_time_per_task.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. It calculates the maximum points achievable by completing tasks and their subtasks within a given time limit `M`. The function iterates over possible numbers of complete tasks (from 0 to `n`), calculates the total time used for these tasks, and then determines the remaining time available for solving subtasks. For each iteration, it computes the points from the completed tasks and the number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time, ensuring that the total number of subtasks solved does not exceed the remaining subtasks available. The function returns the maximum points achievable, which is the sum of points from complete tasks and the number of subtasks solved. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `M` is too small to complete any tasks or subtasks, or where `t` contains very large values, leading to no subtasks being solvable within the remaining time.
