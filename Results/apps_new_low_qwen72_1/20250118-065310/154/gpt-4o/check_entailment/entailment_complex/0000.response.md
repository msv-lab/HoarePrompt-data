Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and parses the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t` from the input.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `total_time_per_task` is correctly initialized as the sum of the times required to solve all subtasks of a single task. This is essential for calculating the time used when considering the completion of multiple tasks.

3. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop iterates over the possible number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) from 0 to `n`. This is appropriate because Polycarp can choose to complete any number of tasks within the given time limit `M`.

4. **Time Calculation**: The time used for completing `complete_tasks` tasks is calculated as `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. This is correct as it reflects the total time spent on the subtasks of the completed tasks.

5. **Points Calculation**: The points earned from completing `complete_tasks` tasks are calculated as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. This is correct because each complete task earns `k + 1` points.

6. **Remaining Time**: The remaining time after completing `complete_tasks` tasks is calculated as `M - time_used`. This is correct and ensures that the remaining time is used efficiently.

7. **Subtasks Solved**: The inner loop correctly calculates the number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time. It iterates over each subtask time and checks if the remaining time is sufficient to solve the subtask. If so, it updates the `subtasks_solved` count and reduces the remaining time accordingly.

8. **Capping Subtasks Solved**: The number of subtasks solved is capped at `(n - complete_tasks) * k` to ensure that it does not exceed the remaining subtasks available. This is a necessary check to prevent overcounting.

9. **Max Points Update**: The maximum points are updated by taking the maximum of the current `max_points` and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. This ensures that the function returns the highest possible score.

10. **Return Value**: The function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit `M`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
