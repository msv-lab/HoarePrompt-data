Reasoning: 

The program seems to follow the logic outlined in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The input is read and parsed correctly into `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. These values are used as expected in the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn.

3. **Total Time Calculation**: The total time required to solve all subtasks of one task is calculated as `total_time_per_task = sum(t)`.

4. **Iterate Over Possible Complete Tasks**: The program iterates over the number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) that can be solved within the given time `M`.

5. **Time Used Calculation**: For each iteration, the time used for solving the complete tasks is calculated as `time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.

6. **Check Time Constraint**: If the time used exceeds `M`, the loop breaks, as no more complete tasks can be solved within the remaining time.

7. **Calculate Points from Complete Tasks**: The points earned from complete tasks are calculated as `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.

8. **Remaining Time Calculation**: The remaining time after solving the complete tasks is calculated as `remaining_time = M - time_used`.

9. **Solve Remaining Subtasks**: The program then attempts to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. This is done by iterating over the subtask times in `t` and calculating how many subtasks can be solved within the remaining time.

10. **Cap Subtasks Solved**: The number of subtasks solved is capped at `(n - complete_tasks) * k` to ensure that the subtasks do not exceed the available tasks.

11. **Update Maximum Points**: The maximum points are updated by comparing the current points plus subtasks solved with the previous maximum points.

12. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn.

The logic and calculations appear to be consistent with the problem requirements, and the constraints are handled appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
