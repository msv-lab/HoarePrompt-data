Reasoning: 

The original assessment is mostly correct in its understanding and validation of the program. However, there is a subtle issue in the way the program handles the solving of additional subtasks. Specifically, the inner loop:

```python
for subtask_time in t:
    if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
        max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
        subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
        remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
```

This loop tries to solve as many instances of each subtask as possible with the remaining time. However, this approach might not always yield the optimal solution because it does not consider the most efficient way to use the remaining time. Instead, it should prioritize solving the subtasks that take the least amount of time first, as this would allow Polycarp to solve more subtasks within the remaining time.

To correct this, the subtasks should be sorted in ascending order of their time requirements before attempting to solve them. This ensures that the program maximizes the number of subtasks solved within the remaining time.

Here is the corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        # Sort subtasks by time in ascending order
        t_sorted = sorted(t)
        for subtask_time in t_sorted:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points
```

With this correction, the program will correctly maximize the number of subtasks solved within the remaining time, leading to the optimal solution.

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the suboptimal handling of the remaining time for solving additional subtasks. The corrected version, which sorts the subtasks by time, should be used to ensure the program's correctness.
