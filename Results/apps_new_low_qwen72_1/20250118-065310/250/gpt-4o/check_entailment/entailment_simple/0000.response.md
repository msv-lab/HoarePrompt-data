### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables and data structures (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`).

2. **Initial Check for Existing Marks:**
   - The program checks if the distances `x` and `y` can already be measured using the existing marks. It sets `x_found` and `y_found` to `True` if the distances can be measured.
   - This check is done using the condition `if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set` for `x` and similarly for `y`.

3. **Adding New Marks:**
   - If either `x` or `y` cannot be measured, the program attempts to find a single new mark that can help measure both distances.
   - It does this by checking if adding a mark at `mark + x` or `mark - x` can help measure `y`, and vice versa.
   - If such a mark is found, it is added to `new_marks`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If `new_marks` is non-empty, it prints `1` and the single mark that was added.
   - If `new_marks` is empty, it prints the number of marks needed to measure `x` and `y` and the marks themselves (either `x` or `y` or both).

### Analysis of Conditions and Logic:
- The logic for checking if a distance can be measured is correct.
- The logic for finding a single new mark to measure both distances is also correct.
- The program handles the case where no new marks are needed correctly.
- The program correctly handles the case where one or both distances cannot be measured with the existing marks and prints the appropriate output.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the cases correctly and follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
