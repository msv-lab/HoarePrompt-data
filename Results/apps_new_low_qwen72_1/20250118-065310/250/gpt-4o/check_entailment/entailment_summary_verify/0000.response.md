### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and verify if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up Data Structures:**
   - The function reads `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It reads the list of marks and converts it into a set for efficient lookups.

2. **Initial Check for Existing Marks:**
   - The function iterates through each mark in the list.
   - For each mark, it checks if `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in the set of marks. If either condition is true, it sets `x_found` to `True`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in the set of marks. If either condition is true, it sets `y_found` to `True`.
   - If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, it breaks out of the loop and prints `0`.

3. **Finding a Single New Mark:**
   - If either `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, the function attempts to find a single new mark that can be added to the list to satisfy the condition for either `x` or `y`.
   - It iterates through each mark again and checks several conditions to find a suitable new mark:
     - If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` exists in the set, it adds `mark + x` to the set of new marks.
     - If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in the set, it adds `mark - x` to the set of new marks.
     - If `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` or `mark - y + x` exists in the set, it adds `mark + y` to the set of new marks.
     - If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in the set, it adds `mark - y` to the set of new marks.
   - If a suitable new mark is found, it prints `1` followed by the new mark.

4. **Handling Missing Distances:**
   - If no suitable new mark is found, the function creates a list `result` and adds `x` if `x_found` is `False` and `y` if `y_found` is `False`.
   - It then prints the length of the `result` list and the contents of the list.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Initial Check for Existing Marks:**
  - This part of the code correctly checks if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks. The conditions `mark + x` and `mark - x` (and similarly for `y`) cover all possible pairs of marks that could measure the required distances.

- **Finding a Single New Mark:**
  - The conditions for finding a new mark are complex but necessary to ensure that adding a single mark can help measure the required distances. The conditions check if adding a mark at `mark + x` or `mark - x` (or `mark + y` or `mark - y`) would allow measuring the other distance.
  - However, the conditions are overly complex and may not be necessary. A simpler approach would be to check if adding `x` or `y` directly to any existing mark would allow measuring the other distance.

- **Handling Missing Distances:**
  - This part of the code correctly handles the case where no single new mark can be found to measure both distances. It simply adds the required distances `x` and `y` to the list and prints them.

### Conclusion:

The program is mostly correct, but the conditions for finding a single new mark are overly complex. However, these complex conditions do not introduce any logical errors; they just make the code harder to read and understand. The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**. The given program is correct.
