You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = list(map(int, input().split()))

    y_found = False
    for mark in marks:
        if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:

                    new_marks.add(mark + y)
                elif mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - y)
        if new_marks:
            print(1)
            print(new_marks.pop())
        else:

                result.append(x)
            if not y_found:
                result.append(y)

            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers called `marks`. It then checks if there exist any pairs of marks in the list such that their difference is `x` or `y`. If such pairs exist for both `x` and `y`, it prints `0`. If not, it attempts to find a single new mark that can be added to the list to satisfy the condition for either `x` or `y`. If such a mark is found, it prints `1` followed by the new mark. If no such mark is found, it prints the number of missing distances (`x` or `y`) and the corresponding distances. The function ensures that the input constraints are respected, and it handles cases where the required pairs are not found by attempting to add a new mark or listing the missing distances.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Existing Marks**: The program first checks if the distances `x` and `y` can already be measured using the existing marks. It does this by iterating through each mark and checking if adding or subtracting `x` or `y` results in another mark in the set. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0` and exits.

2. **Finding Additional Marks**: If either `x` or `y` cannot be measured, the program attempts to find a single additional mark that would allow measuring both `x` and `y`. It does this by checking combinations of adding or subtracting `x` and `y` from each existing mark. If such a mark is found, it is added to the `new_marks` set.

3. **Final Output**: If a single mark can measure both `x` and `y`, it prints `1` followed by the mark. If no such single mark is found, it prints the minimum number of marks required to measure `x` and `y` (which would be either `x` or `y` if they are not already measurable).

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initial Check**: The initial check is correct. It correctly identifies if `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks.
- **Finding Additional Marks**: The logic for finding additional marks is more complex but generally correct. It checks all possible combinations of adding and subtracting `x` and `y` from each existing mark to see if a single new mark can cover both distances.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when both `x` and `y` are already measurable or when no single mark can cover both distances.

### Potential Issues:
- **Redundant Checks**: The program might perform redundant checks, especially in the `new_marks` section, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.
- **Optimization**: The program could be optimized to reduce the number of checks, but this is not necessary for correctness.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
