Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Existing Marks**: The program correctly checks if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks. It iterates through each mark and checks if adding or subtracting `x` or `y` results in another mark in the set. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0` and exits. This part is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Finding Additional Marks**: The logic for finding additional marks is more complex but generally correct. The program attempts to find a single additional mark that would allow measuring both `x` and `y` by checking combinations of adding or subtracting `x` and `y` from each existing mark. If such a mark is found, it is added to the `new_marks` set. However, there is a potential issue in the way it checks for the additional marks. Specifically, the conditions for adding marks to the `new_marks` set might be overly complex and could lead to incorrect additions.

3. **Final Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of marks needed and the marks themselves if a single mark can measure both `x` and `y`. If no such single mark is found, it prints the minimum number of marks required to measure `x` and `y` (which would be either `x` or `y` if they are not already measurable). This part is also correct.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initial Check**: The initial check is correct. It correctly identifies if `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks.
- **Finding Additional Marks**: The logic for finding additional marks is mostly correct, but it could be simplified. The current implementation checks multiple conditions for adding marks, which might be redundant. For example, it checks `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, and `mark - x - y` for both `x` and `y`. These conditions are not necessary and can be simplified to just checking if adding or subtracting `x` or `y` from the mark results in a valid mark.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when both `x` and `y` are already measurable or when no single mark can cover both distances.

### Potential Issues:
- **Redundant Checks**: The program performs redundant checks in the `new_marks` section, which could be simplified. For example, instead of checking `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, etc., it should only check `mark + x` and `mark - x` for `x` and similarly for `y`.
- **Optimization**: The program could be optimized to reduce the number of checks, but this is not necessary for correctness.

### Simplified Logic:
A simpler and more efficient way to find the additional marks would be:
```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    marks_set = set(marks)
    x_found = False
    y_found = False
    for mark in marks:
        if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:
            x_found = True
        if mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set:
            y_found = True
        if x_found and y_found:
            break
    if x_found and y_found:
        print(0)
    else:
        new_marks = set()
        for mark in marks:
            if not x_found and (mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set):
                new_marks.add(mark + x)
                new_marks.add(mark - x)
            if not y_found and (mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set):
                new_marks.add(mark + y)
                new_marks.add(mark - y)
        if new_marks:
            print(1)
            print(min(new_marks, key=lambda m: abs(m - (x + y) // 2)))
        else:
            result = []
            if not x_found:
                result.append(x)
            if not y_found:
                result.append(y)
            print(len(result))
            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Conclusion:
Despite the potential for simplification, the original program is logically sound and correctly solves the problem as described. The redundant checks do not affect the correctness of the solution.

Final: **True**
