Reasoning:  
The provided solution appears to correctly address the problem statement. It reads the input values and initializes a set of existing marks for efficient look-up. It then checks if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using the current marks. If both distances can be measured, it prints `0` indicating no additional marks are needed. If one or both distances cannot be measured, it attempts to find a single new mark that can be added to enable the measurement of the missing distance(s). If a suitable single mark is found, it prints `1` followed by the new mark. If no single mark can resolve the issue, it adds the necessary distances `x` and/or `y` directly.

The logic for finding a single new mark involves checking if adding a mark at a position that would allow the measurement of `x` or `y` (or both) is possible. This is done by considering combinations of existing marks and the target distances `x` and `y`.

The solution respects the input constraints and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
