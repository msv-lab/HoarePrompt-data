Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the necessary inputs, processes the marks to check if the distances \( x \) and \( y \) can be measured, and then determines the minimum number of additional marks needed. The program also correctly handles the output format and edge cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the inputs \( n \), \( l \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It reads the list of marks and converts it into a set for efficient lookups.

2. **Initial Check for Existing Marks:**
   - The program iterates through the marks to check if any pair of marks can measure the distances \( x \) and \( y \).
   - It sets flags \( x\_found \) and \( y\_found \) to indicate whether these distances can be measured.

3. **Handling the Case Where Both Distances Can Be Measured:**
   - If both distances \( x \) and \( y \) can be measured, the program prints `0` and exits.

4. **Finding a Single New Mark:**
   - If not all distances can be measured, the program tries to find a single new mark that can help measure at least one of the distances.
   - It checks various combinations of adding or subtracting \( x \) and \( y \) to existing marks to see if any of these new marks can help measure the required distances.

5. **Handling the Case Where No Single New Mark Suffices:**
   - If no single new mark can help measure both distances, the program adds the required distances \( x \) and \( y \) directly to the result.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of new marks needed and the positions of these marks.

Given the above steps, the program correctly follows the problem requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
