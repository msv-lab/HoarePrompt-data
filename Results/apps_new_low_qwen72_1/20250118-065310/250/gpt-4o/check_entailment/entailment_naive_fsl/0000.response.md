Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It checks if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks on the ruler. If both distances can be measured, it outputs `0`. If only one of the distances can be measured, it attempts to find a single new mark that can allow measuring the other distance. If neither distance can be measured, it adds the necessary marks for both distances. The logic for checking and adding marks is thorough and covers the requirements specified in the problem description. No edge cases or logical errors are evident in the provided code.
