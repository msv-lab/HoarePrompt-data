Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Existing Marks**: The program first checks if the distances `x` and `y` can already be measured using the existing marks. It does this by iterating through each mark and checking if adding or subtracting `x` or `y` results in another mark in the set. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0` and exits.

2. **Finding Additional Marks**: If either `x` or `y` cannot be measured, the program attempts to find a single additional mark that would allow measuring both `x` and `y`. It does this by checking combinations of adding or subtracting `x` and `y` from each existing mark. If such a mark is found, it is added to the `new_marks` set.

3. **Final Output**: If a single mark can measure both `x` and `y`, it prints `1` followed by the mark. If no such single mark is found, it prints the minimum number of marks required to measure `x` and `y` (which would be either `x` or `y` if they are not already measurable).

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initial Check**: The initial check is correct. It correctly identifies if `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks.
- **Finding Additional Marks**: The logic for finding additional marks is more complex but generally correct. It checks all possible combinations of adding and subtracting `x` and `y` from each existing mark to see if a single new mark can cover both distances.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when both `x` and `y` are already measurable or when no single mark can cover both distances.

### Potential Issues:
- **Redundant Checks**: The program might perform redundant checks, especially in the `new_marks` section, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.
- **Optimization**: The program could be optimized to reduce the number of checks, but this is not necessary for correctness.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
