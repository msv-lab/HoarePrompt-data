Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Existing Marks**: The program correctly checks if the distances `x` and `y` can already be measured using the existing marks. It iterates through each mark and checks if adding or subtracting `x` or `y` results in another mark in the set. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0` and exits. This part is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Finding Additional Marks**: The logic for finding additional marks is generally correct. It attempts to find a single additional mark that would allow measuring both `x` and `y` by checking combinations of adding and subtracting `x` and `y` from each existing mark. However, the conditions for adding marks to the `new_marks` set are somewhat redundant and can be simplified. Specifically, the conditions:
   - `if mark + x + y in marks_set or mark + x - y in marks_set or mark - x + y in marks_set`
   - `if mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set`
   - `if mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set`
   - `if mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set`

   These conditions are designed to find a single mark that can help measure both `x` and `y`, but they can be simplified to avoid redundancy. For example, checking `mark + x` and `mark - x` for `y` and vice versa is sufficient.

3. **Final Output**: The final output logic is correct. If a single mark can measure both `x` and `y`, it prints `1` followed by the mark. If no such single mark is found, it prints the minimum number of marks required to measure `x` and `y` (which would be either `x` or `y` if they are not already measurable).

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initial Check**: The initial check is correct and efficient.
- **Finding Additional Marks**: The logic is correct but can be simplified. The program checks all possible combinations, which is thorough but can be optimized.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when both `x` and `y` are already measurable or when no single mark can cover both distances.

### Potential Issues:
- **Redundant Checks**: The program performs redundant checks, especially in the `new_marks` section. This can be optimized but does not affect the correctness of the solution.
- **Optimization**: The program could be optimized to reduce the number of checks, but this is not necessary for correctness.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly solves the problem as described. The redundant checks do not impact the correctness but can be simplified for better readability and performance.

Final: **True**
