The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers called `marks`. It then checks if there exist any pairs of marks in the list such that their difference is `x` or `y`. If such pairs exist for both `x` and `y`, it prints `0`. If not, it attempts to find a single new mark that can be added to the list to satisfy the condition for either `x` or `y`. If such a mark is found, it prints `1` followed by the new mark. If no such mark is found, it prints the number of missing distances (`x` or `y`) and the corresponding distances. The function ensures that the input constraints are respected, and it handles cases where the required pairs are not found by attempting to add a new mark or listing the missing distances.
