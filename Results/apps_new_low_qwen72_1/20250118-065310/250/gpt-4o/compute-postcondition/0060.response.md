To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the given conditions:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5.
- `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9.
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`.
- `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`.
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`.
- `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`.
- `mark` is the next element in `marks`.
- At least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`.
- If `not y_found` and `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + y`.
- If none of these conditions are met but `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - y`.
- If `y_found` is `True` or none of the above conditions are met, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```
for mark in marks:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list.
- The variable `mark` is updated to the next element in `marks` at the start of each iteration.
- The length of `marks` is `n`, and since `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `marks`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `mark`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `mark` was the current element in `marks`.
- For the next iteration, `mark` should be the next element in `marks`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `mark` needs to be adjusted to the next element in `marks`.

### Updated State:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`.**
