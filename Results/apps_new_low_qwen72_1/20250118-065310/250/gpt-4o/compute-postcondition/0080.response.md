The code snippet `result.append(y)` adds the value of `y` to the list `result`.

- Initially, `result` contains `[x]` because `x_found` is `False` and `y_found` is `False`.
- After executing `result.append(y)`, `result` now contains `[x, y]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the last element in `marks` processed by the loop, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing `[x, y]`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`.**
