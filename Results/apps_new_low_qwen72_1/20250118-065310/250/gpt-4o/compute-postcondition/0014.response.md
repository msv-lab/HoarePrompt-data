The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `y_found`. This changes the state of `y_found` from its initial condition to `True`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the second element in `marks`, `x_found` remains as determined by the initial conditions, `y_found` is `True`.**
