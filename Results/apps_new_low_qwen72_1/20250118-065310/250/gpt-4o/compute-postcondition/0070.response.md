Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`. If `y_found` is `False`, and if `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains the value `mark + y`. Otherwise, if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains the value `mark - y`. If none of these conditions are met, `new_marks` remains unchanged. If `y_found` is `True`, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
