The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `mark`, `x_found`, or `y_found`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5
- `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`
- `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`
- `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`
- `mark` is the next element in `marks`
- `new_marks` now contains the value `mark + x`
- At least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, `new_marks` contains the value `mark + x`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`**
