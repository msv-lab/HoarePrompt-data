Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the last element in `marks` processed by the loop, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`. If `new_marks` is non-empty, it contains all valid `mark + x` or `mark - x` or `mark + y` or `mark - y` values that were added during the loop execution based on the conditions specified (with one element removed). If `new_marks` is empty, `result` is a list containing `[x, y]`, and both `x_found` and `y_found` are `False`.***
