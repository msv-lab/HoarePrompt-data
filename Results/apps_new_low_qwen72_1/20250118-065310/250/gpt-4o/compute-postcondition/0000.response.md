The provided code snippet reads four integers (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`) and a list of `n` integers (`marks`). It then converts the list `marks` into a set called `marks_set` for faster lookups. Two boolean variables, `x_found` and `y_found`, are initialized to `False`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 = a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] = l.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values read from the input.
- `marks` is updated to the list of integers read from the input.
- `marks_set` is created as a set containing all elements from `marks`.
- `x_found` and `y_found` are both set to `False`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, l is an integer between 2 and 10^9, x is an integer between 1 and l, y is an integer greater than x and less than or equal to l, marks is a list of n integers where 0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l, marks_set is a set containing all elements from marks, x_found is False, y_found is False**
