The provided code snippet consists of two print statements. The first statement prints the integer `1`. The second statement removes an arbitrary element from the set `new_marks` and prints it. This operation modifies the set `new_marks` by removing one of its elements.

Given the initial state, the set `new_marks` is non-empty and contains valid `mark + x`, `mark - x`, `mark + y`, or `mark - y` values that were added during the loop execution based on the conditions specified. After executing the code, the set `new_marks` will have one fewer element.

The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `mark`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unchanged by the code.

Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, l is an integer between 2 and 10^9, x is an integer between 1 and l, y is an integer greater than x and less than or equal to l, marks is a list of n integers where 0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l, marks_set is a set containing all elements from marks, mark is the last element in marks processed by the loop, at least one of x_found or y_found is False, new_marks is a non-empty set containing all valid mark + x or mark - x or mark + y or mark - y values that were added during the loop execution based on the conditions specified (with one element removed)**
