The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the value of `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. Let's analyze the changes:

- `new_marks` was initially an empty set, and now it contains the value `mark - x`.
- No other variables are directly modified by this operation.

The initial conditions remain unchanged except for the modification to `new_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `{mark - x}`, and `x_found` is `False`. Additionally, `mark + x + y` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is not in `marks_set`, and `mark - x + y` is not in `marks_set`. The current value of `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or the current value of `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`.**
