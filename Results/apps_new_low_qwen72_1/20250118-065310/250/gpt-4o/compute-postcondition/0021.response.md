The code snippet sets the variable `y_found` to `True`. This change does not affect the other variables or their relationships as described in the initial state. Therefore, the updated output state includes this new assignment while maintaining all the previous conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, if `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True`. `y_found` is `True`.**
