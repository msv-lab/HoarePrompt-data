Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers called `marks`. It then checks if there exist any pairs of marks in the list such that their difference is `x` or `y`. If such pairs exist for both `x` and `y`, it prints `0`. If not, it attempts to find a single new mark that can be added to the list to satisfy the condition for either `x` or `y`. If such a mark is found, it prints `1` followed by the new mark. If no such mark is found, it prints the number of missing distances (`x` or `y`) and the corresponding distances. The function ensures that the input constraints are respected, and it handles cases where the required pairs are not found by attempting to add a new mark or listing the missing distances. **

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Input Validation:** The function assumes that the input values meet the specified constraints (e.g., `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`). There is no explicit validation to handle inputs outside these constraints.
- **Empty List Handling:** The function does not explicitly handle the case where the `marks` list is empty or has fewer than two elements, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- **Duplicate Marks:** The function assumes that the `marks` list is strictly increasing and contains unique values. If the list contains duplicates, the behavior is undefined.
- **Output Format:** The function prints results directly, which might not be ideal for integration into larger programs. It would be more flexible if the function returned values instead of printing them.
