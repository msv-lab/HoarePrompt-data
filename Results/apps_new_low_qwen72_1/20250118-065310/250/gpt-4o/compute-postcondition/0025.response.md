Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, l is an integer between 2 and 10^9, x is an integer between 1 and l, y is an integer greater than x and less than or equal to l, marks is a list of n integers where 0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l, marks_set is a set containing all elements from marks, mark is the last element in marks processed by the loop. If x_found and y_found are both True, the loop terminates early; otherwise, the loop continues until it processes all elements in marks. The final values of x_found and y_found are determined by whether there exists any mark in marks such that (mark + x) or (mark - x) is in marks_set, and (mark + y) or (mark - y) is in marks_set.**
