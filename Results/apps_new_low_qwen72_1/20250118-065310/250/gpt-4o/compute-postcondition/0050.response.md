The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is a set that exists before this line of code is executed. The values of `mark` and `x` are taken from their current states, and the sum `mark + x` is added to `new_marks`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` contains `mark + x`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` contains `mark + x`.**
