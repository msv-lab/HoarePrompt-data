Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`. If `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True` and `y_found` is `False`. Otherwise, `x_found` remains `False` and `y_found` remains `False`.***
