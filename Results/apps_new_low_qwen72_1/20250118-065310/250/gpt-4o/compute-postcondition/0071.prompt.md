Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, l is an integer between 2 and 10^9, x is an integer between 1 and l, y is an integer greater than x and less than or equal to l, marks is a list of n integers where 0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l, marks_set is a set containing all elements from marks, mark is the last element in marks processed by the loop, at least one of x_found or y_found is False, `new_marks` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for mark in marks:
    if not x_found:
        if (mark + x + y in marks_set or mark + x - y in marks_set or mark -
            x + y in marks_set):
            new_marks.add(mark + x)
        elif mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set:
            new_marks.add(mark - x)
    if not y_found:
        if (mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark -
            y + x in marks_set):
            new_marks.add(mark + y)
        elif mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set:
            new_marks.add(mark - y)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`. If `y_found` is `False`, and if `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing `{mark + y}`. Otherwise, if `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True` and `new_marks` is a set containing `{mark - y}`. If none of these conditions are met, `new_marks` remains an empty set, and the conditions `mark + x + y` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is not in `marks_set`, `mark - x + y` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + y + x` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is not in `marks_set`, and `mark - y + x` is not in `marks_set` or `mark - y - x` is not in `marks_set` still hold.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`. If `not y_found` and `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + y`. If none of these conditions are met but `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - y`. If `y_found` is `True` or none of the above conditions are met, the state remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`. If `y_found` is `False`, and if `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains the value `mark + y`. Otherwise, if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains the value `mark - y`. If none of these conditions are met, `new_marks` remains unchanged. If `y_found` is `True`, `new_marks` remains unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
