The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing. However, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly shown in the given code snippet, the `break` statement would not change the state of any variables but would instead cause an error if executed in this context. Assuming the `break` is part of a larger context that includes a loop or conditional structure, the only effect is to exit that structure.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program exits the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, `x_found` is `True` if `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
