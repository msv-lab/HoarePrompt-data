Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the last element in `marks` processed by the loop, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`. `new_marks` is a set containing all valid `mark + x` or `mark - x` or `mark + y` or `mark - y` values that were added during the loop execution based on the conditions specified. If no such values were found, `new_marks` remains an empty set.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each `mark` in the list `marks`.
   - The conditions inside the loop check whether certain arithmetic operations involving `x` and `y` result in values that are present in `marks_set`.
   - The loop updates `new_marks` based on these conditions and the state of `x_found` and `y_found`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - **Non-invariant Variables**: `mark`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks` can change during the loop execution.
   - `mark` changes with each iteration to the next element in `marks`.
   - `x_found` and `y_found` can transition from `False` to `True` but not back.
   - `new_marks` accumulates values that satisfy the conditions within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - For each `mark` in `marks`, the loop checks if `mark + x` or `mark - x` or `mark + y` or `mark - y` should be added to `new_marks` based on the presence of specific values in `marks_set`.
   - The loop continues until all elements in `marks` have been processed.
   - The final state of `new_marks` will contain all valid values that were added during the loop execution.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The conditions ensure that `new_marks` only contains valid additions based on the specified arithmetic operations and the presence of those results in `marks_set`.
   - If no valid additions are made, `new_marks` remains an empty set.
   - The loop ensures that at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False` initially, but this condition may change as the loop progresses.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes is as described above.
