The code `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value `mark - y` to the set `new_marks`. The preconditions specify the ranges and relationships between the variables, but they do not change. The only change is in the set `new_marks`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5
- `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`
- `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`
- `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`
- `mark` is the next element in `marks`
- At least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`
- If `x_found` is `False`, and if `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark + x`. Otherwise, if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark - x`. If none of these conditions are met, `new_marks` remains unchanged. If `x_found` is `True`, `new_marks` remains unchanged.
- `new_marks` now contains the value `mark - y`

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` now contains the value `mark - y`**
