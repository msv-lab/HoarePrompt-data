The code `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the value `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5.
- `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9.
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`.
- `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`.
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`.
- `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`.
- `mark` is the next element in `marks`.
- At least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`.

After executing the code, the set `new_marks` now contains the value `mark - x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, `new_marks` contains `mark - x`, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`.**
