The code snippet adds the value `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `new_marks` is updated by adding the value `mark - x` to it.
- All other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `mark`, `x_found`, `y_found`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, `new_marks` contains the value `mark - x`, and at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`.**
