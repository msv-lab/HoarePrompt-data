The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` was initially an empty set, it now contains the single element `mark + x`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5
- `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`
- `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`
- `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`
- `mark` is the first element in `marks`
- At least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`
- `new_marks` is a set containing the element `mark + x`
- `x_found` is `False`
- Either `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing the element `mark + x`, `x_found` is `False`, either `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`**
