Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, l is an integer between 2 and 10^9, x is an integer between 1 and l, y is an integer greater than x and less than or equal to l, marks is a list of n integers where 0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l, marks_set is a set containing all elements from marks, x_found is False, y_found is False
Code of the loop:
for mark in marks:
    if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:
        x_found = True
    if mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set:
        y_found = True
    if x_found and y_found:
        break


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True` (i.e., either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `x_found` and `y_found` remains as determined by the initial conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the second element in `marks`. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `x_found` and `y_found` remains as determined by the initial conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the third element in `marks`. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain as determined by the initial conditions.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
