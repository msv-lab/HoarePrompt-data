Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, and `y_found` is `False`. If `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing `{mark + y}`. Otherwise, if `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True` and `new_marks` is a set containing `{mark - y}`. If none of these conditions are met, `new_marks` remains an empty set, and the conditions `mark + x + y` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is not in `marks_set`, `mark - x + y` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + y + x` is not in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is not in `marks_set`, and `mark - y + x` is not in `marks_set` or `mark - y - x` is not in `marks_set` still hold.***
