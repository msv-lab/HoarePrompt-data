The provided code snippet adds the value of `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Based on the initial state and the code, here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5.
   - `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9.
   - `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`.
   - `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`.
   - `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`.
   - `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`.
   - `mark` is the first element in `marks`.
   - At least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, and `y_found` is `False`.
   - If `x_found` is `False`, and `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing the element `mark + x`. Otherwise, if `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing `{mark - x}`. If none of these conditions are met, `new_marks` remains an empty set.
   - Additionally, `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`.
   - If `x_found` is `True`, `new_marks` remains an empty set.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`.

3. **Output State Calculation**:
   - Since `mark + y` is added to `new_marks`, the new state of `new_marks` includes the value `mark + y`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, and `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `{mark + y}`.**
