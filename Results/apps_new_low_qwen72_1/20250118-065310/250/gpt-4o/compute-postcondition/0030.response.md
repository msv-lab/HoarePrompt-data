To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5.
- `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9.
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`.
- `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`.
- `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`.
- `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`.
- `mark` is the last element in `marks` processed by the loop.
- At least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`.
- `new_marks` is an empty set.

Loop Statement:
```python
for mark in marks:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **`marks` List**: The loop iterates over the `marks` list. For the loop to execute the first time, the `marks` list must be non-empty.
2. **Initial State of `mark`**: The problem states that `mark` is the last element in `marks` processed by the loop. However, this is not relevant for the first execution of the loop, as `mark` will take the value of the first element in `marks` during the first iteration.
3. **Other Variables**: The variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks` do not directly control the loop's execution, but they provide context for the loop's behavior.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The `marks` list must have at least one element for the loop to execute the first time.
- Given the constraints, `marks` is guaranteed to have at least two elements (`marks[1]` and `marks[n]`).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the `marks` list must have at least one element. Since `marks` is defined to have at least two elements (as per the given constraints), the loop will always execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, at least one of `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set.**
