The `break` statement causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block (such as an `if` statement) that contains it. However, since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most immediate such structure.

The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is affected. The program will continue execution from the point immediately following the loop or conditional block that was broken out of.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `l` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 1 and `l`, `y` is an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where `0 = marks[1] < marks[2] < ... < marks[n] = l`, `marks_set` is a set containing all elements from `marks`, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is `True` because either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `y_found` is `True` because either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
