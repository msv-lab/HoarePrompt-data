Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Ilya is an experienced player in tic-tac-toe on the 4 × 4 field. He always starts and plays with Xs. He played a lot of games today with his friend Arseny. The friends became tired and didn't finish the last game. It was Ilya's turn in the game when they left it. Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. 

The rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4 × 4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).


-----Input-----

The tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.

Each of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.


-----Output-----

Print single line: "YES" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
xx..
.oo.
x...
oox.

Output
YES

Input
x.ox
ox..
x.o.
oo.x

Output
NO

Input
x..x
..oo
o...
x.xo

Output
YES

Input
o.x.
o...
.x..
ooxx

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Ilya had two winning moves: to the empty cell in the left column and to the leftmost empty cell in the first row.

In the second example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.

In the third example Ilya could have won by placing X in the last row between two existing Xs.

In the fourth example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.

# Annotated Program:
board = []
for _ in range(4):
    board.append(list(input().strip()))
print(func_1(board))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: board is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o'.
def func_1(board):
    lines = []
    for row in board:
        lines.append(row)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `board` is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o', `row` is the last (fourth) row of `board`, `lines` is a list containing all four rows of `board`.
    for col in range(4):
        lines.append([board[row][col] for row in range(4)])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `col` is 4, `lines` contains `[board[0], board[1], board[2], board[3], [board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0], board[3][0]], [board[0][1], board[1][1], board[2][1], board[3][1]], [board[0][2], board[1][2], board[2][2], board[3][2]], [board[0][3], board[1][3], board[2][3], board[3][3]]]`
    lines.append([board[i][i] for i in range(4)])

lines.append([board[i][3 - i] for i in range(4)])
    for line in lines:
        if line.count('x') == 2 and line.count('.') == 2:
            for i in range(3):
                if line[i:i + 3].count('x') == 2 and line[i:i + 3].count('.') == 1:
                    return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `col` is 4, `lines` contains all its initial sublists, and the program does not return 'YES' if none of the sublists in `lines` meet the condition where there are exactly two 'x' characters and one '.' character in any segment of length 3 within the sublist. The variables `col` and `lines` remain constant throughout the loop.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 4x4 list of strings `board` where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o'. It returns 'YES' if any row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal of the board contains exactly two 'x' characters and one '.' character in any segment of length 3. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the `board` itself.
