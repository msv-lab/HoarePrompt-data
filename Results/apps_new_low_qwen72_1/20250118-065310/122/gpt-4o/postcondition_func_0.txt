The function `func_1` accepts a 4x4 list of strings `board` where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o'. It returns 'YES' if any row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal of the board contains exactly two 'x' characters and one '.' character in any segment of length 3. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the `board` itself.
