The code appends the third row (`row`) of the `board` to the list `lines`. This means that `lines` now contains the first, second, and third rows of `board`.

Output State: **`board` is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o', `row` is the third row of `board`, `lines` is a list containing the first, second, and third rows of `board`**
