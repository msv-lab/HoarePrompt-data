The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range specified (which is 3). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range of 0 to 2 (inclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to become 2, and it must still be less than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`col` is 4, `lines` contains at least one sublist, `line` is the first sublist in `lines` and contains exactly two 'x' characters and exactly two '.' characters, `i` is 2, and the substring `line[i:i + 3]` does not contain exactly 2 'x' characters and 1 '.' character.**
