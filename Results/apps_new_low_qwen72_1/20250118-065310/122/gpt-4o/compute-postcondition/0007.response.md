Output State: **`board` is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o', `row` is the last (fourth) row of `board`, `lines` is a list containing all four rows of `board`.**

- **Invariant Variables**: The `board` variable remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop.
- **Final Values**:
  - `board`: Remains a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o'.
  - `row`: After the loop completes, `row` will be the last (fourth) row of `board`.
  - `lines`: Contains all four rows of `board` as a list of lists.
- **Conditions**:
  - The loop executes exactly 4 times if `board` is a 4x4 list.
  - The loop does not execute if `board` is empty. However, in this case, `board` is guaranteed to be a 4x4 list, so the loop will always execute 4 times.
