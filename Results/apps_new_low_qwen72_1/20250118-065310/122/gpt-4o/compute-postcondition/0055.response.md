Postcondition: ***`col` is 4, `lines` contains at least three sublists, and `line` is the third sublist in `lines`. If `line` contains exactly two 'x' characters and two '.' characters, the program does not return 'YES' after the loop finishes, as the loop has executed 3 times and for each iteration, the count of 'x' in `line[i:i + 3]` was not equal to 2 or the count of '.' in `line[i:i + 3]` was not equal to 1.***
