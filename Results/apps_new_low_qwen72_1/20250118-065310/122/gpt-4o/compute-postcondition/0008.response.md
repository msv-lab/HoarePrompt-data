The only object in the loop head is the variable `col`, which is controlled by the `range(4)` function. This means that the loop will execute as long as there are values in the range from 0 to 3. The other variables (`board`, `row`, and `lines`) are not directly involved in the loop condition but provide context for the loop's execution.

For the loop to execute the first time, `col` must be initialized to 0, and the range must include this value, which it does by default. Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head that must hold true for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`col` is 0**
