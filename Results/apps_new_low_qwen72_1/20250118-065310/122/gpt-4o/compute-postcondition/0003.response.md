The only objects in the loop head are the variable `row` and the list `board`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `board`. The loop iterates over each row in the `board`, and at the end of the last iteration, `row` was the first row of `board`, and `lines` contained this first row.

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must now refer to the second row of `board`, and the `board` must still have at least two rows remaining to iterate over.

State: **`board` is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o', `row` is the second row of `board`, `lines` is a list containing the first row of `board`**
