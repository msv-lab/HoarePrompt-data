The code snippet `lines.append([board[row][col] for row in range(4)])` adds a new list to the `lines` list. This new list is generated by iterating over the rows of `board` and selecting the element from each row at the column index specified by `col`. Since `col` is 2, this means the elements from the third column (index 2) of each row in `board` are collected into a new list and appended to `lines`.

Given the initial state:
- `col` is 2
- `lines` contains `[board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0], board[3][0], [board[0][1], board[1][1], board[2][1], board[3][1]]]`

After executing the code, the new list `[board[0][2], board[1][2], board[2][2], board[3][2]]` is appended to `lines`. The value of `col` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`col` is 2, `lines` contains `[board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0], board[3][0], [board[0][1], board[1][1], board[2][1], board[3][1]], [board[0][2], board[1][2], board[2][2], board[3][2]]]`**
