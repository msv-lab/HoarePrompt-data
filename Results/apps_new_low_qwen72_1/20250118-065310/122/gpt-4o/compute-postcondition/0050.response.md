Postcondition: ***`col` is 4, `lines` contains at least three sublists, `line` is the third sublist in `lines`, `i` is 1, and the count of 'x' in `line[i:i + 3]` is not equal to 2 or the count of '.' in `line[i:i + 3]` is not equal to 1. If the count of 'x' in `line[i:i + 3]` is 2 and the count of '.' in `line[i:i + 3]` is 1, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'YES'.***
