The only variables in the loop head are `col` and the range limit, which is 4 in this case. The loop can execute again as long as `col` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `col` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `col` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than 4.

State: **`col` is 2, `lines` contains `[board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0], board[3][0], [board[0][1], board[1][1], board[2][1], board[3][1]]]`**
