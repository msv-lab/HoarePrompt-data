The code appends the first row of the `board` to the `lines` list. Since `row` is the first row of `board`, the `lines` list now contains this row.

Output State: **`board` is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o', `row` is the first row of `board`, `lines` is a list containing the first row of `board`**
