The only objects in the loop head are `row` and `board`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `board`. If there are more rows in `board`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `board` is a 4x4 list of strings, `row` is the second row of `board`, and `lines` is a list containing the first and second rows of `board`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next row in `board` (the third row) needs to become the new `row`. The `board` still needs to have at least 3 rows for the loop to continue.

State: **`board` is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o', `row` is the third row of `board`, `lines` is a list containing the first and second rows of `board`**
