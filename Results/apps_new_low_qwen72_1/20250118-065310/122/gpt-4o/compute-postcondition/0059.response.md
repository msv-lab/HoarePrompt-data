Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a 4x4 list of strings `board` where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o'. It returns 'YES' if any row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal of the board contains exactly two 'x' characters and one '.' character in any segment of length 3. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the `board` itself. **

### Explanation:
- **Input Parameters**: The function takes a single parameter, `board`, which is a 4x4 list of strings. Each string can be '.', 'x', or 'o'.
- **Output**: The function returns either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- **Function Behavior**:
  - The function first creates a list `lines` that includes all rows, columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals of the `board`.
  - It then checks each line in `lines` to see if there is any segment of length 3 that contains exactly two 'x' characters and one '.' character.
  - If such a segment is found, the function immediately returns 'YES'.
  - If no such segment is found after checking all lines, the function returns 'NO'.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the `board` contains invalid characters (not '.', 'x', or 'o'), the function's behavior is undefined.
  - If the `board` is not a 4x4 list, the function's behavior is undefined.
  - The function assumes that the `board` is well-formed and does not perform any validation on the input.
- **Missing Functionality**:
  - The function does not handle cases where the `board` might contain other characters or is not a 4x4 list. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
  - The function does not check for segments of length 3 that span across multiple rows, columns, or diagonals. It only checks contiguous segments within a single line.
