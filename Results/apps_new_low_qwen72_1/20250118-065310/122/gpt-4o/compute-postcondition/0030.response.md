The only objects in the loop head are the variable `line` and the list `lines`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `lines`. If `lines` has more sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lines` contains at least one sublist, and `line` is the first sublist in `lines`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lines` must have at least two sublists. In the next iteration, `line` will be the second sublist in `lines`.

State: **`col` is 4, `lines` contains at least two sublists, and `line` is the second sublist in `lines`.**
