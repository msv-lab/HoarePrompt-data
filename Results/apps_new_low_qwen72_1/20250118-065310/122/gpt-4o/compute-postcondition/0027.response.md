Postcondition: ***`col` is 4, `lines` contains at least one sublist, `line` is the first sublist in `lines` and contains exactly two 'x' characters and exactly two '.' characters, `i` is 2, and the substring `line[i:i + 3]` does not contain exactly 2 'x' characters and 1 '.' character. If the substring `line[i:i + 3]` contains exactly 2 'x' characters and 1 '.' character, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
