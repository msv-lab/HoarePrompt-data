The only variables in the loop head are `col` and the range value `4`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `col` being less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `col` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `col` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than 4.

State: **`col` is 1, `lines` contains a new list `[board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0], board[3][0]]`**
