To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information:

- `board` is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o'.
- `lines` is an empty list.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for row in board:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `row` and the list `board`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if there are elements in `board` to iterate over. Since `board` is a 4x4 list, it must have at least one row for the loop to execute.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state of `board` is a 4x4 list of strings, and `lines` is an empty list. However, the state of `lines` does not affect the loop's execution directly.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `board` must have at least one row. Since `board` is a 4x4 list, it always has 4 rows, so the loop will always execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`board` is a 4x4 list of strings where each string is either '.', 'x', or 'o', and `row` is the first row of `board`, `lines` is an empty list**.
