To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given state and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `col` is 4.
- `lines` contains specific sublists derived from `board`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for line in lines:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `lines` list.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `lines` must be non-empty.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variable in the loop head is `line`, which is derived from `lines`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `lines` is not empty.
3. **Given State of `lines`**: The `lines` list is explicitly defined and contains multiple sublists derived from `board`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `lines` must contain at least one sublist. Given the provided state, `lines` contains multiple sublists, so the condition is already satisfied.

### Final State:
State: **`col` is 4, `lines` contains at least one sublist, `line` is the first sublist in `lines`**

This ensures that the loop will execute the first time.
