The code appends a list to `lines` where each element of this list is taken from the `col`-th column of each row in `board`. Since `col` is 0, the list appended to `lines` will contain the first element of each row in `board`.

Given that `col` is 0 and assuming `board` is a 4xN matrix (where N is the number of columns), the new list will contain the elements `[board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0], board[3][0]]`.

Since `col` remains unchanged and no other variables are mentioned, the output state is:

Output State: **`col` is 0, `lines` contains a new list `[board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0], board[3][0]]`**
