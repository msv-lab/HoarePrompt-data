Postcondition: ***`col` is 4, `lines` contains at least two sublists, and `line` is the second sublist in `lines`. If `line` contains exactly 2 'x' characters and exactly 2 '.' characters, the program returns 'YES' if the count of 'x' in `line[i:i + 3]` is 2 and the count of '.' in `line[i:i + 3]` is 1, where `i` is 2. Otherwise, the program does not return 'YES'.***
