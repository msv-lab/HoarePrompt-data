Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the number of columns required for a monthly calendar, where each column represents a week. The key steps are:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the month (`m`) and the weekday of the first day of the month (`d`).
2. **Days in Month**: It uses a list `days_in_month` to get the number of days in the given month.
3. **Start Day Calculation**: It calculates the starting day of the month (`start_day`), ensuring it is within the range 1 to 7.
4. **Total Days Calculation**: It calculates the total number of days that need to be accommodated in the calendar, including the initial offset due to the starting day.
5. **Number of Columns**: It calculates the number of columns by dividing the total number of days by 7 and adding 1 if there are any remaining days.

The logic is sound and correctly handles the scenarios described in the problem statement. The examples provided also match the expected output. The program does not handle leap years, but the problem specifies a non-leap year, so this is not an issue here.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
