Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Petr wants to make a calendar for current month. For this purpose he draws a table in which columns correspond to weeks (a week is seven consequent days from Monday to Sunday), rows correspond to weekdays, and cells contain dates. For example, a calendar for January 2017 should look like on the picture: $\left. \begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline & {2} & {9} & {16} & {23} & {30} \\ \hline & {3} & {10} & {17} & {24} & {31} \\ \hline & {4} & {11} & {18} & {25} & {} \\ \hline & {5} & {12} & {19} & {26} & {} \\ \hline & {6} & {13} & {20} & {27} & {} \\ \hline & {7} & {14} & {21} & {28} & {} \\ \hline 1 & {8} & {15} & {22} & {29} & {} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ 

Petr wants to know how many columns his table should have given the month and the weekday of the first date of that month? Assume that the year is non-leap.


-----Input-----

The only line contain two integers m and d (1 ≤ m ≤ 12, 1 ≤ d ≤ 7) — the number of month (January is the first month, December is the twelfth) and the weekday of the first date of this month (1 is Monday, 7 is Sunday).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: the number of columns the table should have.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7

Output
6

Input
1 1

Output
5

Input
11 6

Output
5



-----Note-----

The first example corresponds to the January 2017 shown on the picture in the statements.

In the second example 1-st January is Monday, so the whole month fits into 5 columns.

In the third example 1-st November is Saturday and 5 columns is enough.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer representing the month (1 ≤ m ≤ 12), and d is an integer representing the weekday of the first date of the month (1 ≤ d ≤ 7), where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday.
def func():
    m, d = map(int, input().split())

days_in_month = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]

month_days = days_in_month[m - 1]

start_day = (d - 1) % 7 + 1

total_days = (month_days + start_day - 1) // 7

print(total_days + (1 if month_days % 7 != 0 else 0))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `m` and `d` from user input, where `m` represents the month (1 ≤ m ≤ 12) and `d` represents the weekday of the first day of the month (1 ≤ d ≤ 7). It calculates the number of weeks in the month plus one if the month does not end on a Sunday. The function prints this value and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the printed number of weeks plus one if necessary, but the function does not modify the input variables or any other state outside its scope. Note that the function does not handle leap years, which could affect the calculation for February.
