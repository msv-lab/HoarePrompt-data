You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petr wants to make a calendar for current month. For this purpose he draws a table in which columns correspond to weeks (a week is seven consequent days from Monday to Sunday), rows correspond to weekdays, and cells contain dates. For example, a calendar for January 2017 should look like on the picture: $\left. \begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline & {2} & {9} & {16} & {23} & {30} \\ \hline & {3} & {10} & {17} & {24} & {31} \\ \hline & {4} & {11} & {18} & {25} & {} \\ \hline & {5} & {12} & {19} & {26} & {} \\ \hline & {6} & {13} & {20} & {27} & {} \\ \hline & {7} & {14} & {21} & {28} & {} \\ \hline 1 & {8} & {15} & {22} & {29} & {} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ 

Petr wants to know how many columns his table should have given the month and the weekday of the first date of that month? Assume that the year is non-leap.


-----Input-----

The only line contain two integers m and d (1 ≤ m ≤ 12, 1 ≤ d ≤ 7) — the number of month (January is the first month, December is the twelfth) and the weekday of the first date of this month (1 is Monday, 7 is Sunday).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: the number of columns the table should have.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7

Output
6

Input
1 1

Output
5

Input
11 6

Output
5



-----Note-----

The first example corresponds to the January 2017 shown on the picture in the statements.

In the second example 1-st January is Monday, so the whole month fits into 5 columns.

In the third example 1-st November is Saturday and 5 columns is enough.

- Program:
def func():
    (m, d) = map(int, input().split())
    days_in_month = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
    month_days = days_in_month[m - 1]
    start_day = (d - 1) % 7 + 1
    total_days = (month_days + start_day - 1) // 7
    print(total_days + (1 if month_days % 7 != 0 else 0))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `m` and `d` from user input, where `m` represents the month (1 ≤ m ≤ 12) and `d` represents the weekday of the first day of the month (1 ≤ d ≤ 7). It calculates the number of weeks in the month plus one if the month does not end on a Sunday. The function prints this value and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the printed number of weeks plus one if necessary, but the function does not modify the input variables or any other state outside its scope. Note that the function does not handle leap years, which could affect the calculation for February.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has an issue with the calculation of `start_day`. The line `start_day = (d - 1) % 7 + 1` is unnecessary because `d` already represents the day of the week (where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday). This line incorrectly modifies the value of `d`, leading to incorrect calculations for the number of columns.

For example, consider the input `1 7` (January with the first day being Sunday):

- The correct number of columns should be 6, as shown in the problem statement.
- However, with the current implementation:
  - `days_in_month[0]` is 31.
  - `start_day` is calculated as `(7 - 1) % 7 + 1`, which equals 1 (Monday).
  - `total_days` is then `(31 + 1 - 1) // 7`, which equals 4.
  - The additional check `print(total_days + (1 if month_days % 7 != 0 else 0))` adds 1, making the output 5, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the line `start_day = (d - 1) % 7 + 1` should be removed, and the calculation should directly use `d`. The corrected version would look like this:

```python
def func():
    (m, d) = map(int, input().split())
    days_in_month = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
    month_days = days_in_month[m - 1]
    total_days = (month_days + d - 1) // 7
    print(total_days + (1 if month_days % 7 != 0 else 0))
```

This corrected version will handle all cases correctly.
