You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Petr wants to make a calendar for current month. For this purpose he draws a table in which columns correspond to weeks (a week is seven consequent days from Monday to Sunday), rows correspond to weekdays, and cells contain dates. For example, a calendar for January 2017 should look like on the picture: $\left. \begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline & {2} & {9} & {16} & {23} & {30} \\ \hline & {3} & {10} & {17} & {24} & {31} \\ \hline & {4} & {11} & {18} & {25} & {} \\ \hline & {5} & {12} & {19} & {26} & {} \\ \hline & {6} & {13} & {20} & {27} & {} \\ \hline & {7} & {14} & {21} & {28} & {} \\ \hline 1 & {8} & {15} & {22} & {29} & {} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ 

Petr wants to know how many columns his table should have given the month and the weekday of the first date of that month? Assume that the year is non-leap.


-----Input-----

The only line contain two integers m and d (1 ≤ m ≤ 12, 1 ≤ d ≤ 7) — the number of month (January is the first month, December is the twelfth) and the weekday of the first date of this month (1 is Monday, 7 is Sunday).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: the number of columns the table should have.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7

Output
6

Input
1 1

Output
5

Input
11 6

Output
5



-----Note-----

The first example corresponds to the January 2017 shown on the picture in the statements.

In the second example 1-st January is Monday, so the whole month fits into 5 columns.

In the third example 1-st November is Saturday and 5 columns is enough.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
