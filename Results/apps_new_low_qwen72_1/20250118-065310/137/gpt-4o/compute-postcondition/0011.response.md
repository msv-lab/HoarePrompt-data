The provided Python code snippet contains only a print statement that outputs the character `'>` to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `a` and `b` in any way.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes (or `'0'` if `a` is an empty string). If `b` is an empty string, `b` is set to `'0'`. The length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`. '>' is printed.**
