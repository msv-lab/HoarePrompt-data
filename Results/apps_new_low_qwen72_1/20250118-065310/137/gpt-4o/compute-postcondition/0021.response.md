Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes (or `'0'` if `a` is an empty string). If `b` is an empty string, `b` is set to `'0'`. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the program remains in this state. If `a` is greater than `b`, the character `>` has been printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program remains in this state.***
