The value of `b` is updated to `'0'`. Since `b` was initially an empty string, this changes its value explicitly. The state of `a` remains unchanged, as it is still a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes, or it is considered `'0'` if it is an empty string.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes (or `'0'` if `a` is an empty string), `b` is `'0'`**
