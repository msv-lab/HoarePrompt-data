The code snippet `print('=')` prints an equals sign (`=`) to the console. This operation does not alter the values of any variables or affect the state of the program beyond outputting a character.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes (or `'0'` if `a` is an empty string). If `b` is an empty string, `b` is set to `'0'`. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. Additionally, `a` is equal to `b`.**
