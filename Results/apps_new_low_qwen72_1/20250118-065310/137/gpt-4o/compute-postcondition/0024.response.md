The function `func_1` is expected to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, which may contain leading zeroes and can be up to 10^6 digits long. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters. Assuming this is a mistake and the function should indeed take `a` and `b` as parameters, the functionality would be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both strings representing non-negative integers, possibly containing leading zeroes and no more than 10^6 digits long. The function returns the result based on the operations performed on `a` and `b`.**

Since the specific output or operation (such as addition, subtraction, etc.) is not specified in the problem statement, the above description is based on the given parameters. If you provide the specific operation or expected output, I can refine the functionality description accordingly.
