Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes (or `'0'` if `a` is an empty string). If `b` is an empty string, `b` is set to `'0'`. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program remains in this state. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '>' is printed. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, and `a` is greater than `b`, '>' is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `b` and their lengths are equal, the program remains in this state.***
