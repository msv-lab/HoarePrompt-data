The value of `a` is updated to `'0'`. The initial state indicated that `a` was an empty string, and `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes. After executing the code, `a` is now a string with the value `'0'`.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes**
