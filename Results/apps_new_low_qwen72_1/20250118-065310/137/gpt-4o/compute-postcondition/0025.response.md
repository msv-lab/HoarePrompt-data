Functionality: ** The function reads two strings `a` and `b` from user input, where each string represents a non-negative integer and may contain leading zeroes. It then removes leading zeroes from both `a` and `b`, setting them to '0' if they become empty. The function compares the numerical values of `a` and `b` and prints one of the characters '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison: '<' if `a` is numerically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is numerically greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is numerically equal to `b`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result. Edge cases handled include when either `a` or `b` is an empty string after removing leading zeroes, in which case they are set to '0'. The function assumes valid input where `a` and `b` are strings of non-negative integers up to 10^6 digits long. **
