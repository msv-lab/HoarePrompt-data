The provided code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `a` and `b` after stripping any leading zeroes. Given the initial state where `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, each possibly containing leading zeroes and no more than 10^6 digits, the code effectively removes any leading zeroes from both `a` and `b`.

If `a` or `b` consists entirely of zeroes, the result of `.lstrip('0')` will be an empty string. However, since the problem specifies that they represent non-negative integers, if they were to consist entirely of zeroes, they would be considered as "0" (the string representation of the integer zero) after stripping.

Output State: **a is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes, b is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes**
