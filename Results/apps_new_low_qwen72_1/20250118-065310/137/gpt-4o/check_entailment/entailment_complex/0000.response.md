Reasoning:  
The program is designed to read two potentially large integers (with leading zeros) from input, strip the leading zeros, handle edge cases where the numbers might be all zeros (resulting in an empty string), and then compare the two numbers to output the correct relational symbol. 

The logic in the program correctly follows these steps:

1. **Reading Input**: The entire input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into lines to get `a` and `b`.
2. **Stripping Leading Zeros**: Both `a` and `b` are stripped of leading zeros using `.lstrip('0')`. If stripping results in an empty string, it is set to '0' to handle the case of all zeros.
3. **Comparison**:
   - If the length of `a` is less than `b`, `a` is smaller, so `<` is printed.
   - If the length of `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is larger, so `>` is printed.
   - If the lengths are equal, the strings are compared lexicographically to determine the order, printing `<`, `>`, or `=` accordingly.

Each step in the program is logically sound and correctly handles the specified requirements, including edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
