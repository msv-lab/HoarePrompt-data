You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
func_1()

def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if not a:
        a = '0'
    if not b:
        b = '0'
    if len(a) < len(b):
        print('<')
    elif len(a) > len(b):
        print('>')
    elif a < b:
        print('<')
    elif a > b:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two strings `a` and `b` from user input, where each string represents a non-negative integer and may contain leading zeroes. It then removes leading zeroes from both `a` and `b`, setting them to '0' if they become empty. The function compares the numerical values of `a` and `b` and prints one of the characters '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison: '<' if `a` is numerically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is numerically greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is numerically equal to `b`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result. Edge cases handled include when either `a` or `b` is an empty string after removing leading zeroes, in which case they are set to '0'. The function assumes valid input where `a` and `b` are strings of non-negative integers up to 10^6 digits long.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has an issue with how it reads the input. The `sys.stdin.read` method reads all input until EOF (End of File), which means it will read both lines of input into a single string separated by a newline character. However, the `split()` method is used without specifying a separator, which defaults to splitting on whitespace (including newlines). This means that `data` will be a list containing the first number and the rest of the input, including the second number and any trailing whitespace.

To fix this, the program should read each line separately using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure that `a` and `b` are correctly separated. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    a = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lstrip('0')
    b = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lstrip('0')
    if not a:
        a = '0'
    if not b:
        b = '0'
    if len(a) < len(b):
        print('<')
    elif len(a) > len(b):
        print('>')
    elif a < b:
        print('<')
    elif a > b:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')

func_1()
```

This version ensures that each number is read correctly, and the rest of the logic remains the same.
