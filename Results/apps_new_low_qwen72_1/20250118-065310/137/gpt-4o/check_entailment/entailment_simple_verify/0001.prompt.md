You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".

    if not a:
        a = '0'
    if not b:
        b = '0'
    if len(a) < len(b):
        print('<')
    elif len(a) > len(b):

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program reads two very long integers `a` and `b` from standard input, strips any leading zeros, and then compares the two numbers. The logic for comparison is as follows:

1. It splits the input into two parts, `a` and `b`.
2. It removes leading zeros from both `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` becomes an empty string after removing leading zeros, it sets it to '0'.
3. It first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`:
   - If `a` is shorter than `b`, it prints `<`.
   - If `a` is longer than `b`, it prints `>`.
4. If the lengths are equal, it compares the strings lexicographically:
   - If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, it prints `<`.
   - If `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, it prints `>`.
   - If `a` and `b` are equal, it prints `=`.

This approach is correct because:
- Removing leading zeros ensures that the comparison is based on the actual numeric value.
- Comparing the lengths of the strings first handles cases where the numbers differ in length.
- Lexicographic comparison of strings of equal length correctly determines the order of the numbers.

However, there is a small issue with the code: the call to `func_1()` should be outside the definition of `func_1()`. This is a minor syntax error that would prevent the program from running as intended.

Corrected version:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if not a:
        a = '0'
    if not b:
        b = '0'
    if len(a) < len(b):
        print('<')
    elif len(a) > len(b):
        print('>')
    elif a < b:
        print('<')
    elif a > b:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')

func_1()
```

Given the corrected version, the program is correct and will work as expected for the problem description provided.

Correctness: **True**
