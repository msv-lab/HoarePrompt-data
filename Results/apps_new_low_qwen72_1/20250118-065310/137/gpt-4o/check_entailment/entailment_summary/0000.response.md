Reasoning:  
The program is designed to compare two very large non-negative integers represented as strings, considering leading zeroes. It reads the entire input at once, splits it into two parts, strips leading zeroes, and then compares the lengths and values of the resulting strings. This approach is efficient for handling large inputs as specified in the problem statement. 

However, there is an issue with the placement of the call to `func_1()`. In the provided code, `func_1()` is called before its definition, which will result in a `NameError` because the function is used before it is defined. This is a common mistake in Python where the order of function definitions and calls matters.

Additionally, the use of `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input at once might be problematic in certain environments where the input is expected to be provided interactively. However, for the purpose of this problem, assuming the input is correctly provided, this method should work as intended.

Despite these issues, the logic within the `func_1` function itself is correct. It properly handles the comparison of the two numbers, including edge cases where the numbers are all zeroes or contain leading zeroes.

Correctness: **False**

To make the program correct, the call to `func_1()` should be placed after the function definition:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    input_data = sys.stdin.read
    data = input_data().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if not a:
        a = '0'
    if not b:
        b = '0'
    if len(a) < len(b):
        print('<')
    elif len(a) > len(b):
        print('>')
    elif a < b:
        print('<')
    elif a > b:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')

func_1()
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected.
