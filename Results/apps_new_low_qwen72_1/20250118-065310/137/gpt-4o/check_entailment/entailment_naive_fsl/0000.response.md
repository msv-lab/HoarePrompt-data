Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has an issue with how it reads the input. The `sys.stdin.read` method reads all input until EOF (End of File), which means it will read both lines of input into a single string separated by a newline character. However, the `split()` method is used without specifying a separator, which defaults to splitting on whitespace (including newlines). This means that `data` will be a list containing the first number and the rest of the input, including the second number and any trailing whitespace.

To fix this, the program should read each line separately using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure that `a` and `b` are correctly separated. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    a = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lstrip('0')
    b = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lstrip('0')
    if not a:
        a = '0'
    if not b:
        b = '0'
    if len(a) < len(b):
        print('<')
    elif len(a) > len(b):
        print('>')
    elif a < b:
        print('<')
    elif a > b:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')

func_1()
```

This version ensures that each number is read correctly, and the rest of the logic remains the same.
