### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input, which is efficient for handling large inputs. This is important as the problem specifies that the input size can be very large.
   
2. **Processing Input**:
   - The input is split into a list `data` using `split()`, which correctly separates the two numbers `a` and `b`.
   
3. **Removing Leading Zeros**:
   - Both `a` and `b` are stripped of leading zeros using `lstrip('0')`. If the result is an empty string, it is set to `'0'`. This ensures that both `a` and `b` are non-empty and represent valid non-negative integers.
   
4. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If the lengths are different, the longer number is greater.
   - If the lengths are the same, the program compares the strings lexicographically. This is correct because for non-negative integers represented as strings, lexicographic comparison is equivalent to numerical comparison when the lengths are the same.
   - The program prints `<`, `>`, or `=` based on the comparison results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to compare two very long non-negative integers represented as strings. It handles edge cases such as leading zeros and empty strings appropriately. The comparison logic is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
