### Reasoning:

Let's break down the function `func` and the provided function summary to understand the behavior of the program and validate the original assessment.

#### Function Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   This line reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.

2. **Modifying `k`:**
   ```python
   k %= n * 2 - 2
   ```
   This line reduces `k` modulo `2n - 2`. The reason for this is that the pattern of movement repeats every `2n - 2` steps. This is because:
   - Lara moves down `n - 1` steps.
   - Then she moves right `m - 1` steps.
   - Then she moves up `n - 2` steps.
   - Finally, she moves left `m - 2` steps.
   - This totals to `n - 1 + m - 1 + n - 2 + m - 2 = 2n - 2`.

3. **Determining Position:**
   - **If \( k < n - 1 \):**
     ```python
     print(k + 1, 1)
     ```
     This handles the initial vertical descent. For \( k < n - 1 \), Lara is still moving downwards, so the position is \((k + 1, 1)\).

   - **If \( n - 1 \leq k < 2n - 2 \):**
     ```python
     print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
     ```
     This handles the snake-like movement after the initial vertical descent. Here:
     - \( (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) \) calculates the remaining steps in the current vertical segment.
     - \( (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) \) calculates the number of complete horizontal segments covered.

   - **If \( k = 2n - 2 \):**
     ```python
     print(1, 2)
     ```
     This handles the final position after completing the full cycle of \( 2n - 2 \) steps, which is always \((1, 2)\).

#### Validating the Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program fails to correctly compute the position for certain values of `k`. Specifically, it provides the example:
- **Input:** `4 3 8`
- **Expected Output:** `2 2`
- **Actual Output:** `2 1`

Let's analyze this example step-by-step:
- **Initial Values:**
  - \( n = 4 \)
  - \( m = 3 \)
  - \( k = 8 \)

- **Modifying `k`:**
  - \( k \% (2n - 2) = 8 \% 6 = 2 \)

- **Determining Position:**
  - Since \( 2 < n - 1 \) (which is 3), the program falls into the first condition:
    ```python
    print(k + 1, 1)
    ```
    - \( k + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
    - Output: `(3, 1)`

However, the expected output is `(2, 2)`, which suggests that the logic for handling the snake-like movement is indeed flawed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the snake-like movement correctly, leading to incorrect positions for certain values of `k`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
