### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Lara starts at cell (1, 1).
   - She moves down to (n, 1).
   - Then she moves in a snake pattern: right, up, left, up, and so on.
   - The movement continues until she reaches cell (1, 2).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The total number of cells in the matrix is \( n \times m \).
   - The snake pattern repeats every \( 2n - 2 \) steps (since she moves down \( n-1 \) steps, then right \( m-1 \) steps, up \( n-1 \) steps, and left \( m-1 \) steps, but the left and right movements are not counted in the cycle length because they are not part of the vertical movement).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program first reduces \( k \) modulo \( 2n - 2 \) to find the effective number of steps within one complete cycle.
   - If \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \), it means Lara is still moving down the first column, so her position is \( (k + 1, 1) \).
   - If \( k \) is between \( n - 1 \) and \( 2n - 2 \), it means Lara is moving in the snake pattern. The program calculates the row and column based on the remaining steps after the initial downward movement.
   - If \( k \) is exactly \( 2n - 2 \), it means Lara has completed one full cycle and is back at cell (1, 2).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k \) is zero, placing Lara at the starting position (1, 1).
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k \) is \( n \times m - 1 \), which is the last step before reaching (1, 2).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program accurately follows the described movement pattern and correctly determines Lara's position after \( k \) steps.
