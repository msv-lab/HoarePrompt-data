Reasoning:  
The function `func` aims to determine the position of Lara Croft in a 2D dungeon after she has made `k` moves according to the specified movement pattern. The key points to consider are:

1. **Movement Pattern**: Lara starts at (1, 1) and moves down to (n, 1), then follows a snake-like pattern: right to the last column, up one row, left to the second column, up one row, and so on, until she reaches (1, 2).

2. **Reduction of `k`**: The function reduces `k` modulo `2n - 2` because the movement pattern repeats every `2n - 2` steps. This is because:
   - Moving down from (1, 1) to (n, 1) takes `n - 1` steps.
   - Moving right to the last column, up to the first row, and back to the second column takes `n - 1` steps.
   - Therefore, the total cycle length is `2n - 2`.

3. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: If `k < n - 1`, Lara is still moving down the first column. Hence, her position is `(k + 1, 1)`.
   - **Case 2**: If `n - 1 <= k < 2n - 2`, Lara has completed the initial downward movement and is now in the snake pattern. The formula used correctly calculates her position based on the remaining steps after the initial downward movement.
   - **Case 3**: If `k = 2n - 2`, Lara has completed the full cycle and is at the final position (1, 2).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k = 0`, which should return `(1, 1)`.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `k = 2n - 2`, which should return `(1, 2)`.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that `n` is even and both `n` and `m` are within the valid range, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func` appears to correctly implement the logic for determining Lara's position after `k` moves.

Correctness: **True**
