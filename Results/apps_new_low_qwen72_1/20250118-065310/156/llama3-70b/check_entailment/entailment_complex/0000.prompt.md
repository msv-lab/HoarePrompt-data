Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even, k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\) and \(k \geq n - 1\). If \(k < n \times 2 - 2\), the print statement outputs \((2n - k - 2, 1)\). If \(k \geq n \times 2 - 2\), the condition is impossible because \(k\) cannot be both less than \(n \times 2 - 2\) and greater than or equal to \(n \times 2 - 2\) simultaneously.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\). If \(k < n - 1\), the current value of `k` is less than `n - 1`. If \(k \geq n - 1\), the print statement outputs \((2n - k - 2, 1)\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \times m\). It then modifies `k` to be within the range \(0 \leq k < 2n - 2\) by taking `k % (2n - 2)`. Based on the modified value of `k`, the function prints one of the following pairs of integers:
- If \(k < n - 1\), it prints \((k + 1, 1)\).
- If \(n - 1 \leq k < 2n - 2\), it prints \((n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)\).
- If \(k = 2n - 2\), it prints \((1, 2)\).

After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` remains an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is now within the range \(0 \leq k < 2n - 2\). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
