Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution fails to correctly compute the position for certain values of `k`. Specifically, the logic for determining the position after the initial vertical descent and subsequent snake-like movement is flawed. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
4 3 8
```

Expected Output:
```
2 2
```

Actual Output:
```
2 1
```

In this case, after 8 moves, Lara should be at position (2, 2), but the program incorrectly outputs (2, 1). This indicates that the logic for calculating the position during the snake-like movement is incorrect.
