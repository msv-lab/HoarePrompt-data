The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \times m\). It then modifies `k` to be within the range \(0 \leq k < 2n - 2\) by taking `k % (2n - 2)`. Based on the modified value of `k`, the function prints one of the following pairs of integers:
- If \(k < n - 1\), it prints \((k + 1, 1)\).
- If \(n - 1 \leq k < 2n - 2\), it prints \((n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)\).
- If \(k = 2n - 2\), it prints \((1, 2)\).

After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` remains an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is now within the range \(0 \leq k < 2n - 2\). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
