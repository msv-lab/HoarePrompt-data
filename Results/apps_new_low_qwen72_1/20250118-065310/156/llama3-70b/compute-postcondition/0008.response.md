Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\) and \(k \geq n - 1\). If \(k < n \times 2 - 2\), the print statement outputs \((2n - k - 2, 1)\). If \(k \geq n \times 2 - 2\), the condition is impossible because \(k\) cannot be both less than \(n \times 2 - 2\) and greater than or equal to \(n \times 2 - 2\) simultaneously.***
