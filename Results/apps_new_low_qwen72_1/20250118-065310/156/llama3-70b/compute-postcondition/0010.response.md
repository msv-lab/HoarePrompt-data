The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the function definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it should accept three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m.

However, since the function definition does not include any parameters, and the output section is missing, I will assume that the function's actual definition includes these parameters, and I will describe the expected functionality based on the given constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are integers where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even, and `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k < n * m. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
