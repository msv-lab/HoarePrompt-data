Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\). If \(k < n - 1\), the current value of `k` is less than `n - 1`. If \(k \geq n - 1\), the print statement outputs \((2n - k - 2, 1)\).***
