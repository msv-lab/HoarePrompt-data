The provided code snippet takes three inputs, `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then modifies `k` based on a calculation involving `n`.

- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and `n` is always even. `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m.
- The first line reads these values from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- The second line updates `k` to be the remainder of `k` divided by `(n * 2 - 2)`. This ensures that `k` is within the range [0, n*2-3].

Since the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the final state in terms of the input values and the modifications made by the code.

Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * 2 - 2**
