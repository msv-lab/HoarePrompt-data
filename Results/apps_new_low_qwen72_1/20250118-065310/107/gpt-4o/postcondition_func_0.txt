The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and returns the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment in a building with multiple entrances, floors, and apartments. The total time is computed as the sum of three components: `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

- `time_to_exit` is the time it takes for Edward to exit his apartment and is 0 if he is on the ground floor (floor 1), or 10 + (floor_a - 1) seconds otherwise.
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum time required to walk from Edward's entrance to Natasha's entrance, considering both the direct and reverse paths around the building. It is calculated as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` (abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15) and `reverse_walk_time` ((n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15).
- `time_to_target_floor` is the time it takes to reach Natasha's floor, which is (floor_b - 1) * 5 seconds.

The function assumes that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `a` and `b` are valid apartment numbers within the range 1 to `n * m * k` with `a != b`. The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are invalid apartment numbers or where `a == b`.

After the function executes, it returns the total time as an integer, representing the time in seconds for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
