#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k are positive integers representing the number of entrances, floors per entrance, and apartments per floor respectively. a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k, representing the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha respectively, and a != b.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    block_a, floor_a = get_location(a)

block_b, floor_b = get_location(b)
    if (floor_a == 1) :
        time_to_exit = 0
    else :
        time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `a` is a positive integer (1 <= `a` <= `n` * `m` * `k`), `b` is a positive integer (1 <= `b` <= `n` * `m` * `k` and `a` != `b`), `block_a` is the block number of apartment `a`, `floor_a` is the floor number of apartment `a`, `block_b` is the block number of apartment `b`, `floor_b` is the floor number of apartment `b`. If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 + (`floor_a` - 1).
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15

reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15

min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)

time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5

total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
    return total_time
    #The program returns the total time calculated as the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor. Time_to_exit is 0 if floor_a is 1, or 10 + (floor_a - 1) otherwise. Min_walk_time is the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time, where direct_walk_time is abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15 and reverse_walk_time is (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. Time_to_target_floor is (floor_b - 1) * 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and returns the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment in a building with multiple entrances, floors, and apartments. The total time is computed as the sum of three components: `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

- `time_to_exit` is the time it takes for Edward to exit his apartment and is 0 if he is on the ground floor (floor 1), or 10 + (floor_a - 1) seconds otherwise.
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum time required to walk from Edward's entrance to Natasha's entrance, considering both the direct and reverse paths around the building. It is calculated as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` (abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15) and `reverse_walk_time` ((n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15).
- `time_to_target_floor` is the time it takes to reach Natasha's floor, which is (floor_b - 1) * 5 seconds.

The function assumes that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `a` and `b` are valid apartment numbers within the range 1 to `n * m * k` with `a != b`. The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are invalid apartment numbers or where `a == b`.

After the function executes, it returns the total time as an integer, representing the time in seconds for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: apartment is an integer representing the apartment number, such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n * m * k.
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1

floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)

floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns the block number, which is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and the floor number, which is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1. Both `block` and `floor` are derived from the initial state where `apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number, `block` is (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `floor_within_block` is (apartment - 1) % (m * k), and `floor` is (apartment - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_location` takes an integer `apartment` (where 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n * m * k) and returns a tuple containing the block number and the floor number within that block. The block number is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and the floor number is calculated as `((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1`. The function assumes that `m` and `k` are predefined constants representing the number of floors per block and the number of apartments per floor, respectively. The function does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are not defined, nor does it validate the input `apartment` to ensure it falls within the valid range. If `apartment` is out of the valid range, the function may return incorrect results or raise an error.
