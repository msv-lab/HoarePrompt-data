Reasoning:

1. **Function `get_location`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the block and floor numbers for a given apartment number. The formula used is mathematically sound and matches the problem's requirements:
     - `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` correctly identifies the block number.
     - `floor = ((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1` correctly identifies the floor number within the block.
   - The function assumes that `m` and `k` are predefined, which is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the time it takes for Edward to exit his apartment (`time_to_exit`). If Edward is already on the first floor, no additional time is needed; otherwise, it accounts for the time to use the elevator.
   - The function correctly calculates the walking time between blocks (`min_walk_time`). It considers both the direct and reverse paths around the building and selects the minimum time.
   - The function correctly calculates the time it takes to reach Natasha's floor (`time_to_target_floor`).
   - The total time is computed as the sum of these three components, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is read and processed correctly, and the output is printed as required by the problem statement.

Given that the logic and calculations in both functions match the problem's requirements and the program handles the input and output correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
