### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its functions based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `get_location`:
- **Purpose**: This function determines the block and floor of a given apartment.
- **Logic**:
  - `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`: This formula correctly calculates the block number. It divides the apartment number by the total number of apartments in one block and adds 1 to convert from zero-based to one-based indexing.
  - `floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`: This calculates the position of the apartment within the block.
  - `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`: This correctly calculates the floor number within the block by dividing the position within the block by the number of apartments per floor and adding 1 to convert from zero-based to one-based indexing.
- **Correctness**: The formulas used are accurate and consistent with the problem's constraints.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
- **Logic**:
  - **Determine Locations**:
    - `block_a, floor_a = get_location(a)`: Correctly determines the block and floor of Edward's apartment.
    - `block_b, floor_b = get_location(b)`: Correctly determines the block and floor of Natasha's apartment.
  - **Calculate Time to Exit**:
    - `if floor_a == 1: time_to_exit = 0`: If Edward is already on the first floor, no additional time is needed.
    - `else: time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)`: If Edward is not on the first floor, the time to exit includes the elevator wait time (10 seconds) and the time to travel down to the first floor (1 second per floor).
  - **Calculate Walking Times**:
    - `direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`: Calculates the time to walk directly from Edward's block to Natasha's block.
    - `reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`: Calculates the time to walk in the reverse direction around the building.
    - `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)`: Chooses the minimum time between the direct and reverse paths.
  - **Calculate Time to Target Floor**:
    - `time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5`: Calculates the time to walk from the first floor of Natasha's block to her floor (5 seconds per floor).
  - **Total Time**:
    - `total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`: Sums up all the calculated times to get the total time required.

#### Edge Cases and Validity:
- The program correctly handles the case where Edward is already on the first floor.
- The program correctly calculates the time for both direct and reverse paths around the building.
- The program correctly calculates the time to use the elevator and walk within the same block.

#### Consistency with Problem Statement:
- The logic in both functions aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.
- The program accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and handles all aspects of the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
