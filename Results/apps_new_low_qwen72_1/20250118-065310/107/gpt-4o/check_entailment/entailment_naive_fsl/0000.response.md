Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the calculation of `time_to_target_floor` is incorrect. The function assumes that moving between floors takes 5 seconds per floor, but this only applies to moving up or down by stairs. If the elevator is used, the time taken is 1 second per floor after the initial 10-second wait for the elevator to arrive.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Input:
```
n = 4, m = 10, k = 5
a = 200, b = 6
```

Expected Output:
```
39
```

However, the current implementation calculates the time to move from the first floor to the target floor using the stairs, which is not always the optimal choice. In this case, the optimal path involves using the elevator to go down to the first floor, walking to the next block, and then using the stairs to go up to the target floor.

The current implementation calculates:
- `time_to_exit = 19` (10 seconds for the elevator to arrive + 9 seconds to go down 9 floors)
- `min_walk_time = 15` (walking to the next block)
- `time_to_target_floor = 5` (going up 1 floor by stairs)

Total time = 19 + 15 + 5 = 39 seconds, which is correct for this specific example. However, the issue arises in other scenarios where the optimal path might involve using the elevator to go up or down multiple floors.

For example, if Edward needs to go up 5 floors and the elevator is faster than the stairs, the current implementation will incorrectly calculate the time using the stairs instead of the elevator.

To fix this, the program should consider the optimal time to move between floors using both the stairs and the elevator and choose the minimum time.
