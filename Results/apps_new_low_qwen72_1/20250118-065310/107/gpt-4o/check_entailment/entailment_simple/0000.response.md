Reasoning:

The provided program aims to calculate the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the layout of the building, including the number of entrances, floors, and apartments per floor. The key aspects of the solution include determining the locations of both apartments, calculating the time to exit the building from Edward's apartment, computing the walking time between entrances (both directly and in reverse), and finally, adding the time needed to reach Natasha's floor.

1. **Function `get_location`**: This function correctly calculates the block (entrance) and floor numbers of an apartment given its number. It uses integer division and modulo operations to break down the apartment number into its corresponding physical location within the building. The calculations are accurate based on the problem's description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Calculating `time_to_exit`**: The time to exit the building from Edward's apartment is correctly calculated. If Edward is already on the first floor, no time is added; otherwise, 10 seconds are added for calling the elevator, plus 1 second for each floor traveled.
   - **Calculating `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`**: These times are calculated by considering the circular nature of the building. The program correctly computes the distance between the two blocks in both directions and multiplies by 15 seconds (the time to move between adjacent blocks).
   - **Calculating `min_walk_time`**: The minimum of the direct and reverse walk times is chosen, which is appropriate for finding the shortest path around the circular building.
   - **Calculating `time_to_target_floor`**: This is the time it takes for Edward to walk up or down to Natasha's floor using the stairs, which is correctly calculated as 5 seconds per floor.
   - **Total time calculation**: The total time is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, which logically follows from the problem's requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The functions and their calculations align with the expected behavior and constraints provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
