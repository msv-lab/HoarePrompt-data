Reasoning:  

1. **Input Validation**: The problem specifies that the inputs for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` must be within certain ranges and that `a` and `b` must be distinct. The provided functions do not explicitly validate these conditions. However, since the problem guarantees valid inputs, this is not a concern for correctness but something to note for robustness.

2. **Location Calculation (`get_location`)**:
   - The function correctly calculates the block and floor numbers for a given apartment number.
   - The block calculation `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` correctly identifies the block number.
   - The floor calculation `((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1` correctly identifies the floor number.
   - The function assumes `m` and `k` are predefined, which is true in the context of the main function `func_1`.

3. **Time Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - **Time to Exit (`time_to_exit`)**: The function correctly calculates the time it takes for Edward to exit his apartment. If he is already on the first floor, no additional time is needed; otherwise, it adds the time to wait for the elevator and the time to travel down to the first floor.
   - **Walking Time (`min_walk_time`)**: The function correctly calculates the time to walk from Edward's block to Natasha's block, considering both the direct and reverse paths. It uses the modulo operation to handle the circular nature of the building.
   - **Time to Target Floor (`time_to_target_floor`)**: The function correctly calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor using the stairs.
   - **Total Time**: The function sums up the times correctly to get the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

4. **Output**: The function `func_1` returns the total time as an integer, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
