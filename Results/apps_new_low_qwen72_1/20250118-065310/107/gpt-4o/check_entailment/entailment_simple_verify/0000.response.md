Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a potential flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. The main issue is that the function assumes that moving between floors always takes 5 seconds per floor, which is only true when using the stairs. However, the elevator is available, and it can be more efficient for certain scenarios, especially when moving more than one floor.

Let's break down the logic and verify it step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `block_a, floor_a` and `block_b, floor_b` are correctly calculated using the `get_location` function.
   - `time_to_exit` is correctly calculated based on whether Edward is already on the first floor or needs to use the elevator to reach it.

2. **Walking Between Blocks:**
   - `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are correctly calculated to find the minimum walking time between blocks.

3. **Moving to Target Floor:**
   - The current implementation calculates `time_to_target_floor` as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, assuming that Edward will use the stairs to reach the target floor.
   - This is indeed a logical error because the elevator might be a faster option if the target floor is more than one floor away.

4. **Optimal Path Calculation:**
   - To fix this, we need to consider both the stairs and the elevator for moving between floors and choose the minimum time.
   - The time to move between floors using the elevator is `10 + (floor_b - 1)` (10 seconds for the elevator to arrive + 1 second per floor).

Let's modify the function to include the elevator option:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    (block_a, floor_a) = get_location(a)
    (block_b, floor_b) = get_location(b)
    
    if floor_a == 1:
        time_to_exit = 0
    else:
        time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)
    
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15
    reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
    min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)
    
    # Calculate time to target floor using stairs and elevator
    time_to_target_floor_stairs = (floor_b - 1) * 5
    time_to_target_floor_elevator = 10 + (floor_b - 1)
    time_to_target_floor = min(time_to_target_floor_stairs, time_to_target_floor_elevator)
    
    total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
    return total_time

def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return (block, floor)
```

### Verification:
Let's re-evaluate the provided examples with the corrected function:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `n = 4, m = 10, k = 5, a = 200, b = 6`
   - Expected Output: `39`
   - Calculation:
     - `block_a = 4`, `floor_a = 10`
     - `block_b = 1`, `floor_b = 2`
     - `time_to_exit = 10 + (10 - 1) = 19`
     - `direct_walk_time = abs(4 - 1) % 4 * 15 = 45`
     - `reverse_walk_time = (4 - abs(4 - 1)) % 4 * 15 = 15`
     - `min_walk_time = 15`
     - `time_to_target_floor_stairs = (2 - 1) * 5 = 5`
     - `time_to_target_floor_elevator = 10 + (2 - 1) = 11`
     - `time_to_target_floor = min(5, 11) = 5`
     - `total_time = 19 + 15 + 5 = 39`
   - Correct output: `39`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `n = 3, m = 1, k = 5, a = 7, b = 2`
   - Expected Output: `15`
   - Calculation:
     - `block_a = 2`, `floor_a = 1`
     - `block_b = 1`, `floor_b = 1`
     - `time_to_exit = 0`
     - `direct_walk_time = abs(2 - 1) % 3 * 15 = 15`
     - `reverse_walk_time = (3 - abs(2 - 1)) % 3 * 15 = 15`
     - `min_walk_time = 15`
     - `time_to_target_floor_stairs = (1 - 1) * 5 = 0`
     - `time_to_target_floor_elevator = 10 + (1 - 1) = 10`
     - `time_to_target_floor = min(0, 10) = 0`
     - `total_time = 0 + 15 + 0 = 15`
   - Correct output: `15`

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical error in the program. The provided solution does not account for the possibility of using the elevator, which can be more efficient in certain scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect as it stands.

Final: **False**
