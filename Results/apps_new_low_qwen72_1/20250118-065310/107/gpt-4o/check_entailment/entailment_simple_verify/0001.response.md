Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its components to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

### Function `get_location`
This function takes an apartment number and returns the corresponding block and floor numbers. The logic is as follows:
- `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`: This correctly calculates the block number. Each block contains \( m \times k \) apartments, so dividing by this product and adding 1 gives the block number.
- `floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`: This calculates the position of the apartment within the block.
- `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`: This correctly calculates the floor number within the block. Each floor contains \( k \) apartments, so dividing by \( k \) and adding 1 gives the floor number.

The function is correct and accurately computes the block and floor numbers based on the given apartment number.

### Function `func_1`
This function calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Let's break down the steps:
1. **Determine Locations**:
   - `block_a, floor_a = get_location(a)`: This correctly determines the block and floor of Edward's apartment.
   - `block_b, floor_b = get_location(b)`: This correctly determines the block and floor of Natasha's apartment.

2. **Calculate Exit Time**:
   - `if floor_a == 1: time_to_exit = 0 else: time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)`: This correctly calculates the time required for Edward to exit his block. If he is already on the first floor, no additional time is needed. Otherwise, it includes the 10-second elevator wait time plus the time to travel down to the first floor (1 second per floor).

3. **Calculate Walk Times**:
   - `direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`: This calculates the time to walk directly to the target block. The `% n` ensures that the walk time is calculated considering the circular nature of the building.
   - `reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`: This calculates the time to walk in the reverse direction. Again, the `% n` ensures the correct calculation for the circular layout.
   - `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)`: This selects the minimum time between the two directions.

4. **Calculate Target Floor Time**:
   - `time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5`: This correctly calculates the time required to walk from the first floor of the target block to Natasha's floor (5 seconds per floor).

5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - `total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`: This sums up all the calculated times to get the total time required.

### Evaluation
- The function `get_location` correctly maps an apartment number to its block and floor.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment, considering all the specified constraints and conditions.
- The program handles all edge cases, such as when Edward is already on the first floor, and the circular nature of the building.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
