Reasoning:

The provided solution and its assessment are mostly correct, but there are a few points to consider and verify:

1. **Function `get_location`**:
   - The function correctly computes the block and floor of an apartment.
   - The formula used to determine the block and floor is accurate based on the problem's constraints and the way apartments are numbered.
   - The function does not validate the input `apartment` to ensure it falls within the valid range, but this is assumed to be handled by the caller (`func_1`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It correctly determines the locations of both apartments using `get_location`.
   - It correctly calculates the time required to exit the current block if Edward is not already on the first floor. This includes the elevator wait time (10 seconds) and the time to travel down to the first floor (1 second per floor).
   - It correctly calculates the time required to walk directly to the target block and the time to walk in the reverse direction around the building. The minimum of these two times is chosen.
   - It correctly adds the time required to walk from the first floor of the target block to Natasha's floor.

However, there is a subtle issue in the calculation of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`:
- The formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n` is unnecessary because `abs(block_a - block_b)` will always be less than `n` (since `block_a` and `block_b` are both between 1 and `n`). Therefore, the `% n` operation is redundant and can be removed.
- The formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n` is also unnecessary for the same reason. The `% n` operation is redundant and can be removed.

Despite this redundancy, the logic remains correct and the program will still produce the correct output. However, for clarity and efficiency, the `% n` operations can be removed.

Given that the core logic and calculations are correct, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
