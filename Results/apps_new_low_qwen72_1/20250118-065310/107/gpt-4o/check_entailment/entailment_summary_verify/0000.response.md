### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and evaluate the correctness of the program based on the given problem description, the program code, and the function summaries.

1. **Function `get_location`**:
   - This function correctly computes the block and floor numbers for a given apartment number.
   - The calculations are:
     - `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
     - `floor = ((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1`
   - These formulas are mathematically sound and correctly map the apartment number to its corresponding block and floor.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
   - The steps involved are:
     - Calculate the time to exit the current building (`time_to_exit`).
     - Calculate the time to walk directly to the target block (`direct_walk_time`).
     - Calculate the time to walk in the reverse direction to the target block (`reverse_walk_time`).
     - Choose the minimum walking time (`min_walk_time`).
     - Calculate the time to reach the target floor within the target block (`time_to_target_floor`).
     - Sum these times to get the total time (`total_time`).

3. **Time Calculations**:
   - **`time_to_exit`**: Correctly calculates the time to exit the current building using the elevator if necessary.
   - **`direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`**: Correctly calculates the time to walk to the target block in both directions and chooses the minimum.
   - **`time_to_target_floor`**: This is where the original assessment identifies a potential issue. The current implementation assumes that moving between floors always takes 5 seconds per floor, which is true for stairs but not for the elevator.

4. **Optimal Path Consideration**:
   - The original assessment suggests that the program should consider the optimal time to move between floors using both the stairs and the elevator.
   - However, the problem statement specifies that the elevator is only used to move to the first floor, and once at the first floor, Edward can either walk to the target block or use the stairs to reach the target floor.
   - Therefore, the current implementation is actually correct because:
     - If Edward is not on the first floor, he must use the elevator to get to the first floor.
     - Once on the first floor, he can walk to the target block.
     - From the target block, he can use the stairs to reach the target floor, which is the optimal choice since the elevator is not available for this part of the journey.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identified a potential issue with the `time_to_target_floor` calculation. The program correctly handles the transition to the first floor using the elevator and then uses the stairs to reach the target floor, which is the optimal strategy given the constraints of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
