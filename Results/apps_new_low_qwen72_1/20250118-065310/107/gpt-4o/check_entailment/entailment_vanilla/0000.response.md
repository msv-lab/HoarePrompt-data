Reasoning:

The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `get_location`. The main function `func_1` calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment, while `get_location` determines the block and floor of a given apartment.

1. **Function `get_location`**:
   - It correctly computes the block and floor of an apartment.
   - The formula used to determine the block and floor is accurate based on the problem's constraints and the way apartments are numbered.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It first determines the locations of both apartments using `get_location`.
   - It then calculates the time required to exit the current block if Edward is not already on the first floor. This is done by adding the elevator wait time (10 seconds) and the time to travel down to the first floor (1 second per floor).
   - It calculates the time required to walk directly to the target block and the time to walk in the reverse direction around the building. The minimum of these two times is chosen.
   - Finally, it adds the time required to walk from the first floor of the target block to Natasha's floor.

The logic in both functions is consistent with the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. The calculations for time spent walking between blocks, using the elevator, and walking within the same block are all correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
