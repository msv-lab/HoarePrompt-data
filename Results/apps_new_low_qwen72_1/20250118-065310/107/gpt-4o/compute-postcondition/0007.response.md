Output State: **The program returns the total time calculated as the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor. Time_to_exit is 0 if floor_a is 1, or 10 + (floor_a - 1) otherwise. Min_walk_time is the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time, where direct_walk_time is abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15 and reverse_walk_time is (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. Time_to_target_floor is (floor_b - 1) * 5.**
