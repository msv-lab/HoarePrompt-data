Output State: **The program returns the block number, which is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and the floor number, which is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1. Both `block` and `floor` are derived from the initial state where `apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number, `block` is (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `floor_within_block` is (apartment - 1) % (m * k), and `floor` is (apartment - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1.**
