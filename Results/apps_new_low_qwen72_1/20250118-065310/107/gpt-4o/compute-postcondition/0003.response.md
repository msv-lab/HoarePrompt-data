Functionality: ** The function `get_location` takes an integer `apartment` (where 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n * m * k) and returns a tuple containing the block number and the floor number within that block. The block number is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and the floor number is calculated as `((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1`. The function assumes that `m` and `k` are predefined constants representing the number of floors per block and the number of apartments per floor, respectively. The function does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are not defined, nor does it validate the input `apartment` to ensure it falls within the valid range. If `apartment` is out of the valid range, the function may return incorrect results or raise an error. **
