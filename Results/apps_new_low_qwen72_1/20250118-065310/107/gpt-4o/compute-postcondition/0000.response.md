The provided code snippet calculates the block number, the floor within the block, and the overall floor number based on the given apartment number. Here's the analysis of the entire block of code:

1. `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`: This line calculates the block number by dividing the apartment number (adjusted by subtracting 1) by the product of `m` and `k`, then adding 1 to the result. This gives the block number where the apartment is located.
2. `floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`: This line calculates the floor within the block by taking the remainder of the division of the apartment number (adjusted by subtracting 1) by the product of `m` and `k`.
3. `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`: This line calculates the overall floor number by dividing the `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1 to the result.

Combining these effects, we get the following final state:

Output State: **apartment is an integer representing the apartment number, block is (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, floor_within_block is (apartment - 1) % (m * k), floor is (apartment - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1**
