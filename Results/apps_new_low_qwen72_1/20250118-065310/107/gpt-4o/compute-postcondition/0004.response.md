The code assigns a value to the variable `time_to_exit` based on the calculation `10 + (floor_a - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `time_to_exit` is now equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`) retain their original values and conditions.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a positive integer (1 <= a <= n * m * k), b is a positive integer (1 <= b <= n * m * k and a != b), block_a is the block number of apartment a, floor_a is the floor number of apartment a, block_b is the block number of apartment b, floor_b is the floor number of apartment b, floor_a is not equal to 1, time_to_exit is 10 + (floor_a - 1)**
