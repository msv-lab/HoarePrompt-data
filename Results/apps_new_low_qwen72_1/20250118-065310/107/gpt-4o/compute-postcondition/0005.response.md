Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `a` is a positive integer (1 <= `a` <= `n` * `m` * `k`), `b` is a positive integer (1 <= `b` <= `n` * `m` * `k` and `a` != `b`), `block_a` is the block number of apartment `a`, `floor_a` is the floor number of apartment `a`, `block_b` is the block number of apartment `b`, `floor_b` is the floor number of apartment `b`. If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 + (`floor_a` - 1).***
