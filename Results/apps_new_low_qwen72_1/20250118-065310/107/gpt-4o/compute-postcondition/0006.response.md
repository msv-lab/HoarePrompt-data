The provided code calculates the total time required to move from one apartment to another within a complex structure divided into blocks, floors, and apartments. The initial state includes the block and floor numbers of two apartments (`a` and `b`), and the time required to exit the building from the current floor of apartment `a` (`time_to_exit`). The code computes the walking time between the blocks and the time to reach the target floor, then sums these times to get the total travel time.

Here's the breakdown of the code's effects:
1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, modulo `n`, multiplied by 15. This represents the time to walk directly from one block to another.
2. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as the distance between the blocks when walking in the opposite direction, modulo `n`, multiplied by 15.
3. `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
4. `time_to_target_floor` is the time required to reach the target floor of apartment `b`, which is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.
5. `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers.
- `a` is a positive integer (1 <= `a` <= `n` * `m` * `k`).
- `b` is a positive integer (1 <= `b` <= `n` * `m` * `k` and `a` != `b`).
- `block_a` is the block number of apartment `a`.
- `floor_a` is the floor number of apartment `a`.
- `block_b` is the block number of apartment `b`.
- `floor_b` is the floor number of apartment `b`.
- If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 + (`floor_a` - 1).

After executing the code, the final state is:
- `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
- `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
- `min_walk_time` is `min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)`.
- `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.
- `total_time` is `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a positive integer (1 <= a <= n * m * k), b is a positive integer (1 <= b <= n * m * k and a != b), block_a is the block number of apartment a, floor_a is the floor number of apartment a, block_b is the block number of apartment b, floor_b is the floor number of apartment b, time_to_exit is 0 if floor_a is 1 or 10 + (floor_a - 1) otherwise, direct_walk_time is abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15, reverse_walk_time is (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15, min_walk_time is min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time), time_to_target_floor is (floor_b - 1) * 5, total_time is time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor**.
