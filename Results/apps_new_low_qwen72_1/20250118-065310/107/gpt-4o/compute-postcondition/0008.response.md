The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of entrances.
- `m` is a positive integer representing the number of floors per entrance.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of apartments per floor.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k, representing the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha respectively, and `a` != `b`.

The function returns the total time calculated as follows:

- `time_to_exit` is 0 if the floor of apartment `a` (`floor_a`) is 1, or 10 + (floor_a - 1) otherwise.
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, where:
  - `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
  - `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
- `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept five parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return the total time calculated based on the given formulas.
Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and returns the total time calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` based on the given formulas.**
