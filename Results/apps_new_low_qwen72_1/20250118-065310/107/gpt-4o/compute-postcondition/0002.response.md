The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`, which is an integer representing the apartment number within the range 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n * m * k. The function returns two values: the block number and the floor number. The block number is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and the floor number is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1`.
