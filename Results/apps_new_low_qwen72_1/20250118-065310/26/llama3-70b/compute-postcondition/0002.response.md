The provided code block consists of two lines:

1. `print(-1)` - This line prints `-1` to the console.
2. `exit()` - This line terminates the program immediately after the print statement.

Since the program is terminated after printing `-1`, no further lines of code are executed, and no changes are made to the variables `n` and `k`.

Output State: **n and k are integers provided by the user, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6, and the current value of k is greater than n * (n + 1) // 2**
