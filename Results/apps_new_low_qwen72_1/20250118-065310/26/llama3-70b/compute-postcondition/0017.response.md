The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6 - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 1), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be at least 2).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6 - 1, `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with `matrix[0][0]` set to 1. If `k` was greater than 1, additional elements in the matrix may be set to 1, but the exact number depends on the initial value of `k`.**
