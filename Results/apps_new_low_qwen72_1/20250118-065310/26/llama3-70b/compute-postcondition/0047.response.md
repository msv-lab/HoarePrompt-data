The code prints the third row of the matrix `matrix`. The state of the variables does not change due to this operation. The matrix `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with the lower triangle and diagonal elements set to 1 up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs, and `row` is the third row of the matrix.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ max(0, k - (n * (n + 1) // 2)), `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix where the lower triangle and diagonal elements are set to 1 up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs, `row` is the third row of the matrix**
