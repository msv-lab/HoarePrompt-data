The provided code snippet for the function `func` does not include any parameters explicitly listed in the function definition. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it's implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6.

Since the output section is not provided, I will assume a hypothetical output based on common programming tasks involving such parameters, which might involve some form of calculation or condition checking.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**

Without specific output details, this is the most accurate description based on the provided information. If you can provide more details about the output or the expected behavior of the function, I can refine this description further.
