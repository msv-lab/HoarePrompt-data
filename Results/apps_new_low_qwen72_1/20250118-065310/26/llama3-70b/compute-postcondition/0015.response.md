Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6, `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0. If `k` > 0, `matrix[0][0]` is 1, `matrix[0][1]` is 1, `matrix[1][0]` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `k` is 0, the matrix remains unchanged and `i`, `j`, and `k` retain their initial values (i.e., `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `k` is 0).***
