Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `matrix` is an `n` x `n` matrix with `matrix[0][0]` set to 1. If `k` > 0 initially, `k` is decremented by 3, `matrix[1][0]` is set to 1, `matrix[0][1]` is set to 1, `matrix[1][1]` is set to 1, `matrix[2][1]` is set to 1, and `matrix[1][2]` is set to 1. If `k` is 0 initially, `matrix[1][0]`, `matrix[0][1]`, and `matrix[1][1]` remain 0.***
