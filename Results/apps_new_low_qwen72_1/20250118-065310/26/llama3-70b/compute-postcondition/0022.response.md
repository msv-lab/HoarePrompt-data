To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6 - 1.
- `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with `matrix[0][0]` set to 1.
- If `k` > 0, `matrix[1][1]` is set to 1.
- `j` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `j` and the expression `i + 1`.
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from 0 to `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `j` is less than `i + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it is the loop counter).

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- The condition `j < i + 1` (which is `1 < 2`) still holds true, so the loop will execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6 - 1, `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with `matrix[0][0]` set to 1. If `k` > 0, `matrix[1][1]` is set to 1, `j` is 1**.
