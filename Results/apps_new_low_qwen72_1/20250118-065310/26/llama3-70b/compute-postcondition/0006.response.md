To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the loop head condition:

```python
for j in range(i + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the range function `range(i + 1)`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(i + 1)` generates at least one value. This means `i + 1` must be greater than 0.

3. **Initial State Given:**
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6.
   - `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0.

4. **Determine the Condition for the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 1` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, which is greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

5. **State Before the First Execution:**
   - The state of `i` is 0.
   - The state of `j` will be 0 during the first iteration of the loop.
   - The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `matrix`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6, `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0**
