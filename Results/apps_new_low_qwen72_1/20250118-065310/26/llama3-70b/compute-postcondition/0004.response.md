The code initializes a square matrix named `matrix` with dimensions `n` x `n`, where each element in the matrix is initially set to 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `k` being greater than the sum of the first `n` natural numbers also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6. If `k` > `n * (n + 1) // 2`, the condition holds true, indicating that `k` is greater than the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0.**
