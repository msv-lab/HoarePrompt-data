To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
  - `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ max(0, k - (n * (n + 1) // 2)).
  - `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix where the lower triangle and diagonal elements are set to 1 up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs.
  - `row` is the first row of the matrix.

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for row in matrix:
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the objects in the loop head:**
   - The loop iterates over `row` in `matrix`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another row in `matrix` that has not yet been processed.

3. **Current state of `row`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `row` was the first row of `matrix`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - The next iteration should process the second row of `matrix`.
   - Therefore, `row` should now be the second row of `matrix`.

5. **Check the other states:**
   - `n`, `k`, and `matrix` do not change as they are not part of the loop head or directly modified by the loop.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `row` to point to the next row in `matrix`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ max(0, k - (n * (n + 1) // 2)), `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix where the lower triangle and diagonal elements are set to 1 up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs, `row` is the second row of the matrix**
