Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the user input. It checks if `k` is greater than the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`n * (n + 1) // 2`). If `k` exceeds this sum, the function prints `-1` and exits. Otherwise, it initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros. The function then sets the lower triangular and diagonal elements of the matrix to `1` until `k` becomes zero or the matrix is fully populated. Finally, the function prints each row of the matrix. After the function concludes, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is reduced to the maximum of 0 and the original `k` minus the number of `1`s placed in the matrix, and the `n x n` matrix has its lower triangular and diagonal elements set to `1` up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs. If `k` was initially too large, the function prints `-1` and exits early. **
