Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6, `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0. If `k` > 0, `matrix[0][0]` is set to 1 and `k` is an integer such that 0 < k ≤ 10^6 - 1, while `i` and `j` remain 0. If `k` is 0, the matrix remains unchanged and `i`, `j`, and `k` retain their initial values.***
