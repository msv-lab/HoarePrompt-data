Reasoning:
The original assessment is largely accurate, but there are a few subtle issues that need to be addressed to ensure the program meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Condition Check for Validity**: The condition `if k > n * (n + 1) // 2:` is correct. It ensures that if `k` is greater than the number of unique positions in the matrix (considering symmetry), the program outputs `-1` and exits. This is a necessary check to handle invalid inputs.

2. **Matrix Filling Logic**: The program fills the matrix in a way that maintains symmetry by setting both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` to `1` for `j` ranging from `0` to `i`. This approach is generally correct for ensuring symmetry, but it does not necessarily guarantee that the matrix is lexicographically maximal.

3. **Lexicographic Maximality**: To ensure the matrix is lexicographically maximal, the program should prioritize filling the diagonal elements before moving to the off-diagonal elements. This is because placing a `1` on the diagonal has a higher lexicographic value compared to placing a `1` in the off-diagonal positions. However, the current implementation fills the diagonal and off-diagonal elements simultaneously, which might not always result in the lexicographically maximal matrix.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k` is 0, the program correctly outputs a matrix filled with zeros.
   - When `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`, the program fills the entire upper triangle and the diagonal, which is the maximum possible symmetric configuration.

5. **Output**: The program prints the matrix in the required format, with each row on a new line and elements separated by spaces.

To address the issue of lexicographic maximality, the program should first fill the diagonal elements and then move to the off-diagonal elements. Here is a revised version of the program that ensures lexicographic maximality:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k > n * (n + 1) // 2:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Fill the diagonal elements first
    for i in range(n):
        if k > 0:
            matrix[i][i] = 1
            k -= 1
    
    # Fill the off-diagonal elements
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if k > 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 1
                matrix[j][i] = 1
                k -= 1
    
    for row in matrix:
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
```

This revised program ensures that the matrix is filled in a lexicographically maximal manner by prioritizing the diagonal elements.

Given the original program's issues with lexicographic maximality, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
