You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given matrix with n rows and n columns filled with zeroes. You should put k ones in it in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal (the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right corner) and is lexicographically maximal.

One matrix is lexicographically greater than the other if the first different number in the first different row from the top in the first matrix is greater than the corresponding number in the second one.

If there exists no such matrix then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output resulting matrix. Otherwise output -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1

Output
1 0 
0 0 

Input
3 2

Output
1 0 0 
0 1 0 
0 0 0 

Input
2 5

Output
-1

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k > n * (n + 1) // 2:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            if k > 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 1
                matrix[j][i] = 1
                k -= 1
    for row in matrix:
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the user input. It checks if `k` is greater than the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`n * (n + 1) // 2`). If `k` exceeds this sum, the function prints `-1` and exits. Otherwise, it initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros. The function then sets the lower triangular and diagonal elements of the matrix to `1` until `k` becomes zero or the matrix is fully populated. Finally, the function prints each row of the matrix. After the function concludes, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is reduced to the maximum of 0 and the original `k` minus the number of `1`s placed in the matrix, and the `n x n` matrix has its lower triangular and diagonal elements set to `1` up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs. If `k` was initially too large, the function prints `-1` and exits early.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2` correctly. In this case, the matrix should be filled with ones along and above the main diagonal, but the current implementation will leave the last element unfilled if `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

For example, consider the input `2 3`:
- The expected output should be:
  ```
  1 1
  1 1
  ```
- However, the program will output:
  ```
  1 1
  1 0
  ```

This is because the loop condition `if k > 0` will prevent the last element from being set to 1 when `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
