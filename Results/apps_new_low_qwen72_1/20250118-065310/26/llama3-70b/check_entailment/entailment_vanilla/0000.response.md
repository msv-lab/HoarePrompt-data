Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to create a symmetric matrix with `k` ones placed in such a way that the matrix is lexicographically maximal. The approach taken by the program is to fill the matrix starting from the top-left corner, placing ones in both the upper and lower triangles (including the diagonal) to maintain symmetry. This ensures that the matrix is filled in a lexicographically maximal manner because it starts filling from the highest possible positions (top-left).

However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Condition Check for Validity**: The program checks if `k` is greater than `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the maximum number of unique positions (considering symmetry) in an `n x n` matrix. If `k` exceeds this value, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to place more than this number of ones while maintaining symmetry.

2. **Matrix Filling Logic**: The program iterates over the matrix, filling the diagonal and the upper triangle first, and simultaneously filling the corresponding positions in the lower triangle to maintain symmetry. This approach ensures that the matrix is filled in a lexicographically maximal order because it starts from the top-left corner and moves downwards and rightwards.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k` is 0, the program will correctly output a matrix filled with zeros.
   - When `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`, the program will fill the entire upper triangle and the diagonal, which is the maximum possible symmetric configuration.

4. **Output**: The program prints the matrix in the required format, with each row on a new line and elements separated by spaces.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all specified requirements and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
