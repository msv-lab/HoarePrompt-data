Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given matrix with n rows and n columns filled with zeroes. You should put k ones in it in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal (the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right corner) and is lexicographically maximal.

One matrix is lexicographically greater than the other if the first different number in the first different row from the top in the first matrix is greater than the corresponding number in the second one.

If there exists no such matrix then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output resulting matrix. Otherwise output -1.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k > n * (n + 1) // 2) :
        print(-1)

exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6. If `k` > `n * (n + 1) // 2`, the condition holds true, indicating that `k` is greater than the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
    matrix = [([0] * n) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            if k > 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 1
                matrix[j][i] = 1
                k -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ max(0, k - (n * (n + 1) // 2)), and `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix where the lower triangle and diagonal elements are set to 1 up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs.
    for row in matrix:
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ max(0, k - (n * (n + 1) // 2)), `matrix` is a `n` x `n` matrix where the lower triangle and diagonal elements are set to 1 up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs, `row` is the last row of the matrix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the user input. It checks if `k` is greater than the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`n * (n + 1) // 2`). If `k` exceeds this sum, the function prints `-1` and exits. Otherwise, it initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros. The function then sets the lower triangular and diagonal elements of the matrix to `1` until `k` becomes zero or the matrix is fully populated. Finally, the function prints each row of the matrix. After the function concludes, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is reduced to the maximum of 0 and the original `k` minus the number of `1`s placed in the matrix, and the `n x n` matrix has its lower triangular and diagonal elements set to `1` up to the first `min(k, n * (n + 1) // 2)` pairs. If `k` was initially too large, the function prints `-1` and exits early.
