Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `k` is greater than the maximum possible number of 1s that can be placed in a symmetric matrix of size `n x n`. This is calculated as `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. If `k` is greater than this value, the program prints `-1` and exits. This check ensures that the problem constraints are respected.
3. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.
4. **Filling the Matrix**: The program iterates over the matrix and places 1s in the lower triangular part and the diagonal, ensuring symmetry. The condition `if k > 0` ensures that only `k` 1s are placed.
5. **Output**: The program prints the matrix row by row.

However, there is a minor issue in the code that affects its correctness:
- **Early Exit**: The `exit()` function is called after the initial check, which would terminate the program prematurely. This is incorrect and should be removed.

Given the above points, the program is almost correct but contains a critical error due to the premature exit. Removing the `exit()` call will make the program work as intended.

Correctness: **False** (due to the premature exit caused by `exit()`)
