Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to place `k` ones in an `n x n` matrix such that the matrix is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal and is lexicographically maximal. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The program first checks if `k` is greater than the maximum possible number of unique positions in the lower triangle and the diagonal of the matrix, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. If `k` is greater, it prints `-1` and exits, correctly handling the case where the required number of ones cannot be placed.

2. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.

3. **Placing Ones**: The program iterates over the lower triangular part of the matrix (including the diagonal). For each position `(i, j)` where `j <= i`, it places a `1` in both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` (to ensure symmetry) and decrements `k` until `k` reaches zero or all positions in the lower triangle and diagonal are filled.

4. **Output**: The program prints the resulting matrix row by row. If `k` was initially too large, the function would have already printed `-1` and exited.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, placing the ones in the correct positions and ensuring the matrix is symmetric and lexicographically maximal.

Correctness: **True**
