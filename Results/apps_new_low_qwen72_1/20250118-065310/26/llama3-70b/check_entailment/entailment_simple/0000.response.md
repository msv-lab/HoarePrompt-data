Reasoning:  
The program starts by reading two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input. It checks if `k` is greater than the maximum possible number of unique pairs (including the diagonal) in an `n x n` matrix, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. If `k` exceeds this value, the program prints `-1` and exits, correctly handling the case where it's impossible to place `k` ones while maintaining symmetry.

However, there is a significant issue in the program: the `exit()` function is called immediately after the conditional check, which means the program will always terminate after the `if` block, regardless of whether the condition is met or not. This prevents the rest of the code from executing, including the logic to construct the matrix and print it.

If the `exit()` call were removed, the program would proceed to initialize a `n x n` matrix filled with zeros. It then iterates over the lower triangle and the diagonal of the matrix, placing ones until `k` is exhausted. The placement of ones ensures that the matrix remains symmetric about the main diagonal. Finally, the program prints the matrix row by row.

Given the presence of the `exit()` function, the program does not execute the matrix construction and printing logic, leading to incorrect behavior for valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
