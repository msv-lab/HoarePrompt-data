Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2` correctly. In this case, the matrix should be filled with ones along and above the main diagonal, but the current implementation will leave the last element unfilled if `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

For example, consider the input `2 3`:
- The expected output should be:
  ```
  1 1
  1 1
  ```
- However, the program will output:
  ```
  1 1
  1 0
  ```

This is because the loop condition `if k > 0` will prevent the last element from being set to 1 when `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
