Reasoning: 
The original assessment provides a detailed and accurate analysis of the program. Let's break down the key points and validate them using the annotated code:

1. **Condition Check for Validity**:
   - The program correctly checks if `k` is greater than `n * (n + 1) // 2`. This is the maximum number of unique positions in an `n x n` matrix considering symmetry. If `k` exceeds this value, the program outputs `-1`, which is correct because it's impossible to place more than this number of ones while maintaining symmetry.

2. **Matrix Filling Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the matrix, filling the diagonal and the upper triangle first, and simultaneously filling the corresponding positions in the lower triangle to maintain symmetry. This approach ensures that the matrix is filled in a lexicographically maximal order because it starts from the top-left corner and moves downwards and rightwards.
   - The nested loops ensure that each element in the lower triangle (including the diagonal) is considered, and the corresponding element in the upper triangle is also set to 1 to maintain symmetry.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k` is 0, the program correctly outputs a matrix filled with zeros.
   - When `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`, the program will fill the entire upper triangle and the diagonal, which is the maximum possible symmetric configuration.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the matrix in the required format, with each row on a new line and elements separated by spaces.

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements and handles edge cases correctly. The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

Final: **True**
