Reasoning: 

Let's carefully examine the logic of the program to determine its correctness. The program aims to fill a matrix with ones in such a way that it is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal and lexicographically maximal. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Check:**
   - The program reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than `n * (n + 1) // 2`. This check is correct because the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a symmetric matrix of size `n x n` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than this value, the program prints `-1` and exits, which is correct.

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.

3. **Filling the Matrix:**
   - The program uses nested loops to fill the matrix:
     - The outer loop iterates over the rows from `0` to `n-1`.
     - The inner loop iterates over the columns from `0` to `i` (inclusive), ensuring that only the lower triangle and the diagonal are considered.
     - If `k > 0`, it sets `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` to `1` and decrements `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - After filling the matrix, the program prints each row of the matrix.

### Key Points to Consider:
- **Symmetry:** The program ensures symmetry by setting both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` to `1` for each pair `(i, j)`.
- **Lexicographical Maximality:** The program fills the matrix starting from the top-left corner and moving downwards and rightwards, which ensures that the matrix is lexicographically maximal.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the maximum possible number of ones. It also correctly handles the case where `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

### Addressing the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program leaves the last element unfilled when `k` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`. However, this is not correct. The program's loop structure ensures that all possible positions are filled before `k` reaches zero. For example, with `n = 2` and `k = 3`:
  - The first iteration (`i = 0, j = 0`) sets `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][0]` to `1`, decrementing `k` to `2`.
  - The second iteration (`i = 1, j = 0`) sets `matrix[1][0]` and `matrix[0][1]` to `1`, decrementing `k` to `1`.
  - The third iteration (`i = 1, j = 1`) sets `matrix[1][1]` and `matrix[1][1]` to `1`, decrementing `k` to `0`.

Thus, the matrix will be correctly filled as:
```
1 1
1 1
```

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and fills the matrix in a symmetric and lexicographically maximal manner. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

Final: **True**
