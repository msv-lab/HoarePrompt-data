The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6`. It then checks if `k` exceeds the maximum possible number of ones (`max_ones`) in an `n x n` symmetric matrix with a diagonal of ones. If `k` exceeds `max_ones`, the function prints `-1` to the console and exits. Otherwise, it constructs an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros, and fills it with ones in a way that maximizes the number of ones while maintaining symmetry, until `k` is exhausted. Finally, it prints the matrix to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the values of `n`, `k`, and `max_ones`, and the matrix is printed to the console. The function itself does not return any value.
