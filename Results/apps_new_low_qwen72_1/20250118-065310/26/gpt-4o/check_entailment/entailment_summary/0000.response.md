Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` from standard input. This is essential for solving the problem as specified.

2. **Maximum Ones Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible number of ones (`max_ones`) that can be placed in an `n x n` symmetric matrix. The formula used, `n * (n + 1) // 2`, is correct because it accounts for the diagonal elements and the upper/lower triangular elements above/below the diagonal.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where `k` exceeds `max_ones` by printing `-1` and exiting. This ensures that the program does not attempt to place more ones than is possible, which would result in an invalid matrix.

4. **Matrix Construction**:
   - The program initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.
   - It then fills the matrix with ones in a way that maintains symmetry and maximizes the lexicographical order:
     - It starts by placing ones on the diagonal.
     - For each row, it places ones in the upper triangle (and corresponding lower triangle) until `k` is exhausted.
   - The placement of ones is done in a way that ensures the matrix remains symmetric and lexicographically maximal.

5. **Output**: The program prints the resulting matrix to the console, which is the expected output format.

6. **Execution Summary**: The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, confirming that it follows the logic outlined in the problem description.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
