You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given matrix with n rows and n columns filled with zeroes. You should put k ones in it in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal (the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right corner) and is lexicographically maximal.

One matrix is lexicographically greater than the other if the first different number in the first different row from the top in the first matrix is greater than the corresponding number in the second one.

If there exists no such matrix then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output resulting matrix. Otherwise output -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1

Output
1 0 
0 0 

Input
3 2

Output
1 0 0 
0 1 0 
0 0 0 

Input
2 5

Output
-1

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    k = int(data[1])
    max_ones = n * (n + 1) // 2
    if k > max_ones:
        print(-1)
        return
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        if k <= 0:
            break
        matrix[i][i] = 1
        k -= 1
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if k <= 0:
                break
            if k >= 2:
                matrix[i][j] = 1
                matrix[j][i] = 1
                k -= 2
            elif k == 1:
                matrix[i][j] = 1
                k -= 1
    for row in matrix:
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6`. It then checks if `k` exceeds the maximum possible number of ones (`max_ones`) in an `n x n` symmetric matrix with a diagonal of ones. If `k` exceeds `max_ones`, the function prints `-1` to the console and exits. Otherwise, it constructs an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros, and fills it with ones in a way that maximizes the number of ones while maintaining symmetry, until `k` is exhausted. Finally, it prints the matrix to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the values of `n`, `k`, and `max_ones`, and the matrix is printed to the console. The function itself does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem description for generating a symmetric matrix with a maximum lexicographical order. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and parses the values `n` and `k`.

2. **Maximum Ones Calculation**: It correctly calculates the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a symmetric matrix of size `n x n`, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k` exceeds the maximum number of ones that can be placed, the program outputs `-1` and returns, which is the correct behavior as per the problem description.

4. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with zeros, ensuring a clean slate for placing ones.

5. **Placing Ones**:
   - The program starts by placing ones on the main diagonal until `k` becomes zero or less.
   - It then places ones in the upper triangle and their symmetric counterparts in the lower triangle, ensuring the matrix remains symmetric.
   - The placement is done in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order by starting from the top-left corner and moving right and down.

6. **Output**: The final matrix is printed row by row, which matches the expected output format.

Given these points, the program handles all edge cases and generates the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
