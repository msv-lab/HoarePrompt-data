Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem description for generating a symmetric matrix with a maximum lexicographical order. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and parses the values `n` and `k`.

2. **Maximum Ones Calculation**: It correctly calculates the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a symmetric matrix of size `n x n`, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k` exceeds the maximum number of ones that can be placed, the program outputs `-1` and returns, which is the correct behavior as per the problem description.

4. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix is initialized with zeros, ensuring a clean slate for placing ones.

5. **Placing Ones**:
   - The program starts by placing ones on the main diagonal until `k` becomes zero or less.
   - It then places ones in the upper triangle and their symmetric counterparts in the lower triangle, ensuring the matrix remains symmetric.
   - The placement is done in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order by starting from the top-left corner and moving right and down.

6. **Output**: The final matrix is printed row by row, which matches the expected output format.

Given these points, the program handles all edge cases and generates the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
