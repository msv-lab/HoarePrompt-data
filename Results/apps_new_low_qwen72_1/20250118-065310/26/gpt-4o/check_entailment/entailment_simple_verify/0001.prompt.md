You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given matrix with n rows and n columns filled with zeroes. You should put k ones in it in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal (the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right corner) and is lexicographically maximal.

One matrix is lexicographically greater than the other if the first different number in the first different row from the top in the first matrix is greater than the corresponding number in the second one.

If there exists no such matrix then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output resulting matrix. Otherwise output -1.

For each `i` from 0 to `min(n, k) - 1` and each `j` from `i + 1` to `n - 1`, if `k` was initially greater than or equal to 2, both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` are set to 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then converts the first two elements of this list into integers `n` and `k`, which represent the size of the matrix and the number of ones to place, respectively.

2. **Maximum Ones Check**: The program calculates the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a symmetric matrix of size `n` using the formula `max_ones = n * (n + 1) // 2`. This is because each pair of off-diagonal elements counts as two ones, and diagonal elements count as one. If `k` exceeds `max_ones`, the program prints `-1` and returns, which is correct.

3. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.

4. **Placing Ones**:
   - The program iterates over the rows of the matrix.
   - For each row `i`, it places a one on the diagonal element `matrix[i][i]` and decrements `k` by 1.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements in the row `i` (from `i+1` to `n-1`).
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it places ones in both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` and decrements `k` by 2.
   - If `k` is exactly 1, it places a one in `matrix[i][j]` and decrements `k` by 1.

5. **Output**: The program prints the resulting matrix by iterating over each row and joining the elements with spaces.

**Correctness Analysis**:
- The program correctly checks if `k` exceeds the maximum possible number of ones for a symmetric matrix.
- It places ones in the matrix in a lexicographically maximal manner by starting from the top-left corner and moving down the diagonal, then filling the upper triangle.
- The program ensures symmetry by placing ones in both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` when appropriate.
- The output format is correct, printing the matrix row by row with elements separated by spaces.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
