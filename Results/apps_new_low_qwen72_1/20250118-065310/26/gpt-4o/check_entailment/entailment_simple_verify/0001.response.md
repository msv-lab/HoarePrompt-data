Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it correctly by splitting and converting the first two elements to integers `n` and `k`. This part is handled accurately.

2. **Maximum Ones Check**: The calculation of `max_ones = n * (n + 1) // 2` is correct. This formula represents the maximum number of ones that can be placed in a symmetric matrix of size `n` (considering the main diagonal and pairs of off-diagonal elements). If `k` exceeds `max_ones`, the program correctly prints `-1` and returns, which is the expected behavior.

3. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros, which is necessary and done correctly.

4. **Placing Ones**:
   - The program iterates over the rows of the matrix, starting from the top-left corner.
   - For each row `i`, it places a one on the diagonal element `matrix[i][i]` and decrements `k` by 1. This ensures that the diagonal elements are filled first, which is a good strategy for achieving lexicographical maximality.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements in the row `i` (from `i+1` to `n-1`).
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it places ones in both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` and decrements `k` by 2. This ensures symmetry and efficiently uses the remaining ones.
   - If `k` is exactly 1, it places a one in `matrix[i][j]` and decrements `k` by 1. This handles the case where only one more one can be placed, ensuring that the matrix remains symmetric.

5. **Output**: The program prints the resulting matrix by iterating over each row and joining the elements with spaces. The output format is correct and matches the required format.

**Correctness Analysis**:
- The program correctly checks if `k` exceeds the maximum possible number of ones for a symmetric matrix.
- It places ones in the matrix in a lexicographically maximal manner by starting from the top-left corner and moving down the diagonal, then filling the upper triangle.
- The program ensures symmetry by placing ones in both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` when appropriate.
- The output format is correct, printing the matrix row by row with elements separated by spaces.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Final: **True**
