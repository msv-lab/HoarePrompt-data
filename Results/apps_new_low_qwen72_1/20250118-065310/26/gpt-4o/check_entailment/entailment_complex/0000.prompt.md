Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given matrix with n rows and n columns filled with zeroes. You should put k ones in it in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal (the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right corner) and is lexicographically maximal.

One matrix is lexicographically greater than the other if the first different number in the first different row from the top in the first matrix is greater than the corresponding number in the second one.

If there exists no such matrix then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output resulting matrix. Otherwise output -1.


-----Examples-----

Output
1 0 0 
0 1 0 
0 0 0 

Input
2 5

Output
-1

# Annotated Program:

    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().strip().split()

n = int(data[0])

k = int(data[1])

max_ones = n * (n + 1) // 2
    if (k > max_ones) :
        print(-1)
        return
        #The program returns nothing, but `-1` has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is the integer value from the input data, k is the integer value from the input data, max_ones is n * (n + 1) // 2, and k is less than or equal to max_ones
    matrix = [([0] * n) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        if k <= 0:
            break
        
        matrix[i][i] = 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if k <= 0:
                break
            if k >= 2:
                matrix[i][j] = 1
                matrix[j][i] = 1
                k -= 2
            elif k == 1:
                matrix[i][j] = 1
                k -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix where for each `i` from 0 to `min(n, k) - 1`, `matrix[i][i]` is 1. For each `i` from 0 to `min(n, k) - 1` and each `j` from `i + 1` to `n - 1`, if `k` was initially greater than or equal to 2, both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` are set to 1. If `k` was exactly 1, only `matrix[i][j]` is set to 1 for the last `j` where `k` was 1.
    for row in matrix:
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with the same structure as before the loop started.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6`. It then checks if `k` exceeds the maximum possible number of ones (`max_ones`) in an `n x n` symmetric matrix with a diagonal of ones. If `k` exceeds `max_ones`, the function prints `-1` to the console and exits. Otherwise, it constructs an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros, and fills it with ones in a way that maximizes the number of ones while maintaining symmetry, until `k` is exhausted. Finally, it prints the matrix to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the values of `n`, `k`, and `max_ones`, and the matrix is printed to the console. The function itself does not return any value.
