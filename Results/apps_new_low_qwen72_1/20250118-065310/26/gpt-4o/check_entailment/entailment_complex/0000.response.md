Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input. This matches the problem's requirement for input.

2. **Maximum Ones Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of ones (`max_ones`) that can be placed in an `n x n` matrix while maintaining symmetry. This is done using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is correct because it accounts for the upper triangle and the diagonal of the matrix.

3. **Early Exit for Invalid `k`**: If `k` exceeds `max_ones`, the program prints `-1` and exits. This is the correct behavior according to the problem statement, as it indicates that it's impossible to place `k` ones in the matrix while maintaining symmetry.

4. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros. This is a necessary step before placing ones in the matrix.

5. **Placing Ones in the Matrix**:
   - The program places ones on the main diagonal first, which ensures that the matrix remains symmetric.
   - It then places ones in the upper triangle of the matrix, ensuring that for each `i < j`, both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` are set to 1. This maintains symmetry.
   - The program handles the case where `k` is exactly 1 by placing a single one in the upper triangle without a corresponding one in the lower triangle, which is also correct.

6. **Output**: The program prints the matrix row by row, which is the required output format.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `k = 0`, the program correctly outputs a matrix filled with zeros.
   - For `k` values that exceed `max_ones`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - For `k` values that are within the valid range, the program correctly constructs the lexicographically maximal symmetric matrix.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
