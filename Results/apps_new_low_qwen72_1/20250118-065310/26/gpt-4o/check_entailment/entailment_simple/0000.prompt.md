Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given matrix with n rows and n columns filled with zeroes. You should put k ones in it in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal (the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right corner) and is lexicographically maximal.

One matrix is lexicographically greater than the other if the first different number in the first different row from the top in the first matrix is greater than the corresponding number in the second one.

If there exists no such matrix then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output resulting matrix. Otherwise output -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1

Output
1 0 
0 0 

Input
3 2

Output
1 0 0 
0 1 0 
0 0 0 

Input
2 5

Output
-1

                k -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix where for each `i` from 0 to `min(n, k) - 1`, `matrix[i][i]` is 1. For each `i` from 0 to `min(n, k) - 1` and each `j` from `i + 1` to `n - 1`, if `k` was initially greater than or equal to 2, both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` are set to 1. If `k` was exactly 1, only `matrix[i][j]` is set to 1 for the last `j` where `k` was 1.
    for row in matrix:
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with the same structure as before the loop started.
