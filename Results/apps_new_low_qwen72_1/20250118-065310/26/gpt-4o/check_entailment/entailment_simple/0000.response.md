Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values `n` and `k` correctly from the standard input.
2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `k` exceeds the maximum possible number of 1s that can be placed in a symmetric matrix of size `n x n`. This is calculated as `n * (n + 1) // 2`. If `k` is greater than this value, the program prints `-1` and exits, which is correct.
3. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.
4. **Filling the Matrix**:
   - The program iterates over the rows of the matrix.
   - It first sets the diagonal element `matrix[i][i]` to 1 and decrements `k`.
   - Then, it fills the upper triangle of the matrix (and its symmetric lower triangle) with 1s, ensuring that the matrix remains symmetric.
   - If `k` is exactly 1, it places a single 1 in the upper triangle without a corresponding 1 in the lower triangle.
5. **Output**: The program prints the resulting matrix row by row.

The program follows the problem's requirements and constraints correctly. It ensures the matrix is symmetric and lexicographically maximal, and it handles the case where no such matrix can be formed.

Correctness: **True**
