Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is less than or equal to `max_ones`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0, and the current value of `k` is less than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
