The provided code snippet reads input from the standard input, processes it to extract two integers `n` and `k`, and then calculates a value called `max_ones` based on `n`.

- The first line sets up a function to read input from the standard input.
- The second line reads the input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input by spaces, and stores the result in the `data` list.
- The third and fourth lines convert the first and second elements of the `data` list to integers and assign them to `n` and `k`, respectively.
- The fifth line calculates `max_ones` as the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6, the final state after executing the code will reflect the new values of `n`, `k`, and `max_ones`.

Output State: **n is the integer value from the input data, k is the integer value from the input data, max_ones is n * (n + 1) // 2**
