Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 1`, and `matrix` is an n by n matrix with specific initializations based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, then `k` is set to 0 and `matrix[i][j]` is 1 (assuming j is a valid index, e.g., 0).***
