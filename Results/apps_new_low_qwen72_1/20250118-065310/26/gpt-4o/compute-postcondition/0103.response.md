The provided Python code snippet prints the elements of a row in the matrix, converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces. This operation does not alter any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with at least one row remaining to be processed.**
