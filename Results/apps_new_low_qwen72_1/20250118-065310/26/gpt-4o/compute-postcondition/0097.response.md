Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix where for each `i` from 0 to `min(n, k) - 1`, `matrix[i][i]` is 1. For each `i` from 0 to `min(n, k) - 1` and each `j` from `i + 1` to `n - 1`, if `k` was initially greater than or equal to 2, both `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` are set to 1. If `k` was exactly 1, only `matrix[i][j]` is set to 1 for the last `j` where `k` was 1.**
