The first line assigns the value 1 to the element at position `[i][j]` in the matrix. Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, this modifies `matrix[2][3]` to 1. The second line decrements `k` by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. No other variables are affected by these operations.

Output State: **n is greater than 3, i is 2, j is 3, k is 0, matrix[2][3] is 1**
