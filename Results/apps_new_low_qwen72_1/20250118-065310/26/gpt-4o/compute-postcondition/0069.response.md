Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 3), 0)`, and `matrix[1][j]` and `matrix[j][1]` are set to 1 for each `j` from 2 to `n - 1` as long as `k >= 2`, and `matrix[1][j]` is set to 1 for the last iteration where `k == 1`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
