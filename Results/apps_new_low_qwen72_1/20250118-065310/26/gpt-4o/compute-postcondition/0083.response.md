The `break` statement does not alter the values of any variables; it only causes the program to exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to the variables in this snippet, the values remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If `k` >= 2, `matrix[2][3]` is 1, `matrix[3][2]` is 1. If `k` < 2, `matrix[2][3]` is 1. If `k` == 1, `k` is set to 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
