Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is updated to `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 3`, and `matrix[1][j]` and `matrix[j][1]` are set to 1 for a valid index `j`. If `k` is less than 2, `k` is updated to `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 1`, and if `k` is 1, it is set to 0 and `matrix[i][j]` is set to 1 (assuming `j` is a valid index, e.g., 0).***
