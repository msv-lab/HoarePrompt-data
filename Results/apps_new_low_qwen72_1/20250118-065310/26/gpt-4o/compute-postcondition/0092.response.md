The code modifies the matrix at positions `[i][j]` and `[j][i]` by setting them to 1, and then reduces the value of `k` by 2. Given the initial conditions, we can determine the final state as follows:

- `n` is greater than 5 (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `j` is 5 (unchanged).
- `k` is reduced by 2. Depending on the initial value of `k`:
  - If `k` was initially greater than or equal to 2, it is now reduced by 2.
  - If `k` was initially 1, it is now 0.
  - If `k` was initially less than 1, it remains less than or equal to 0 (since reducing it further keeps it non-positive).

- The matrix values are updated:
  - `matrix[2][5]` is set to 1.
  - `matrix[5][2]` is set to 1.

Given these changes, the final state is:

Output State: **n is greater than 5, i is 2, j is 5, k is reduced by 2 (if k was initially greater than or equal to 2, it is now k - 2; if k was initially 1, it is now 0; if k was initially less than 1, it remains less than or equal to 0), matrix[2][3] is 1, matrix[3][2] is 1, matrix[2][5] is 1, matrix[5][2] is 1, matrix[2][4] is 1, matrix[4][2] is 1**.
