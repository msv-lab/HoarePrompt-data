To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `min(n, k)`.
- `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` is 0 or negative.
- `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with at least one row.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for row in matrix:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each row in the `matrix`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more row in the `matrix`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `row`.
- The state of `matrix` is crucial for determining if the loop can execute again. Since `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with at least one row, for the loop to execute one more time, the `matrix` must have at least two rows.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `matrix` needs to be adjusted to ensure it has at least two rows.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_ones`, `k`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with at least two rows.**
