The code initializes a matrix of size `n` by `n` where each element is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from the input data, `k` is the integer value from the input data, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is less than or equal to `max_ones`, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0**.
