Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0 except for `matrix[0][0]` which is 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is updated to `k - 2`, and `matrix[0][j]` and `matrix[j][0]` are set to 1. If `k` is 1, `k` is updated to 0. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
