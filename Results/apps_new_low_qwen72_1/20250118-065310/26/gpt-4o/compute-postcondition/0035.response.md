Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[0][2]`, and `matrix[2][0]` are set to 1, and `k` is decremented by 2. If `k` is 1, `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][2]` are set to 1, and `k` is decremented by 1. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, `matrix` remains unchanged and `k` is not modified.***
