Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5. If `k` <= 0, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `matrix[2][3]` is 1. If `k` >= 2, `matrix[2][3]` is 1, `matrix[3][2]` is 1, `matrix[2][4]` is 1, `matrix[4][2]` is 1, and `k` is reduced by 2. If `k` was initially 1, `k` is now 0, and `matrix[2][4]` is 1. If `k` was initially greater than 1 but less than 2, `k` is reduced by 1, and `matrix[2][3]` and `matrix[3][2]` remain 1.***
