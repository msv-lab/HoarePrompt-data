To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 3), 0) - 1`
- `matrix[1][j]` and `matrix[j][1]` are set to 1 for each `j` from 2 to `n - 1` as long as `k >= 2`, and `matrix[1][j]` is set to 1 for the last iteration where `k == 1`
- `matrix[2][2]` is 1

Loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.
2. Given `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `j` starts from 3 and goes up to `n - 1`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `i` is 2
- `j` must start from 3 and go up to `n - 1`

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
