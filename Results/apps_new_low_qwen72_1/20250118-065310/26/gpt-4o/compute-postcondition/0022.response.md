The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `i`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop iterates from `i + 1` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` is 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0 except for `matrix[0][0]` which is 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is updated to `k - 2`, and `matrix[0][j]` and `matrix[j][0]` are set to 1. If `k` is 1, `k` is updated to 0. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
