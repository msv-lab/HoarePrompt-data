Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 1`, `matrix` is an n by n matrix with specific initializations based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
