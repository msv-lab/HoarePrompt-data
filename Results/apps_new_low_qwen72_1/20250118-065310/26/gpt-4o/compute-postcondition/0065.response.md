Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. If `k` >= 2, `matrix[1][3]` is 1, `matrix[3][1]` is 1, and `k` is `k - 2`. If `k` == 1, `matrix[1][3]` is set to 1, and `k` is decremented by 1. If `k` <= 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
