Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6`. It then checks if `k` exceeds the maximum possible number of ones (`max_ones`) in an `n x n` symmetric matrix with a diagonal of ones. If `k` exceeds `max_ones`, the function prints `-1` to the console and exits. Otherwise, it constructs an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros, and fills it with ones in a way that maximizes the number of ones while maintaining symmetry, until `k` is exhausted. Finally, it prints the matrix to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the values of `n`, `k`, and `max_ones`, and the matrix is printed to the console. The function itself does not return any value. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `k` is exactly equal to `max_ones`, the matrix will be completely filled with ones.
- If `k` is less than `max_ones`, the matrix will have fewer ones, and the remaining cells will be zeros.
- If `k` is 0, the matrix will remain filled with zeros.
- The function assumes that the input will always be valid (i.e., `n` and `k` within the specified ranges). If invalid input is provided, the behavior is undefined.
