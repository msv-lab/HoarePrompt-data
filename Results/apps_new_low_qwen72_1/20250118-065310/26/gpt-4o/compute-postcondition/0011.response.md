To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` is less than or equal to `max_ones` - 1.
- `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0 except for `matrix[0][0]` which is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(i + 1, n)` is not empty. This means that `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is 0:
- `i + 1` is 1.
- For the range `range(1, n)` to be non-empty, `1` must be less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
- The other variables (`k`, `max_ones`, and `matrix`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute based on the loop head condition.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is less than or equal to `max_ones` - 1, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0 except for `matrix[0][0]` which is 1**
