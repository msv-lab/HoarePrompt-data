Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0)`, and `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with `matrix[0][0]` set to 1. If `k` was initially greater than or equal to 2, both `matrix[0][j]` and `matrix[j][0]` are set to 1 for each `j` from 1 to `n - 1`. If `k` was exactly 1, only `matrix[0][j]` is set to 1 for the last iteration where `k` was 1. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the matrix remains unchanged beyond the initial setting of `matrix[0][0]` to 1.***
