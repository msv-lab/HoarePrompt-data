The provided Python code snippet `print(' '.join(map(str, row)))` prints a formatted string of the elements in `row`. This operation does not alter the values of any variables or the structure of the matrix. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with at least one row.**
