The code snippet `print(' '.join(map(str, row)))` prints the elements of `row` separated by spaces. This does not modify any variables in the current state. The values of `n`, `i`, `max_ones`, `k`, and the structure of `matrix` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with at least two rows.**
