To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 1`
- `matrix` is an n by n matrix with specific initializations based on the value of `k`

Loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 1`.
   - `matrix` is an n by n matrix with specific initializations based on the value of `k`.

2. **Loop Head Condition:**
   - The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, n)`.
   - This means the loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Loop Condition:**
   - Given `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2.
   - The loop will execute if `2 < n`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **State of Other Variables:**
   - `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is valid as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 1`, which depends on the initial value of `k` but does not affect the loop condition directly.
   - `matrix` is initialized based on the value of `k`, but this initialization does not affect the loop condition directly.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` starts from 2 and goes up to `n - 1`.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 1`, `matrix` is an n by n matrix with specific initializations based on the value of `k`**.
