The code snippet `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console. This operation does not alter the values of any variables in the current state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the side effect of printing `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from the input data, `k` is the integer value from the input data, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is greater than `max_ones`, `-1` is printed to the console.**
