The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`**.
