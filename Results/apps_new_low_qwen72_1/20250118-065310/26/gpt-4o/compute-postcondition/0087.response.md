Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If `k` was initially 1, `k` is now 0, and `matrix[2][4]` is 1. If `k` was initially greater than 1, `k` is reduced by 1, and `matrix[2][3]` and `matrix[3][2]` remain 1. If `k` was initially less than 1, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `matrix[2][3]` is 1.***
