Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0 except for `matrix[0][0]`. If `k` is 1, `matrix[0][2]` is set to 1, and `k` is decremented by 1. If `k` is not 1, `matrix` remains unchanged and `k` is not modified.***
