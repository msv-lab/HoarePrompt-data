The only objects in the loop head are `row` and `matrix`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `matrix`. The loop iterates over each row in the `matrix`. At the end of the last iteration, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with at least two rows, and `i` is `min(n, k)` where `k` is 0 or negative.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more row left in the `matrix`. Since the `matrix` has at least two rows, after the first iteration, there should still be at least one row left for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop is about to process the next row in the `matrix`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `min(n, k)`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is 0 or negative, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with at least one row remaining to be processed.**
