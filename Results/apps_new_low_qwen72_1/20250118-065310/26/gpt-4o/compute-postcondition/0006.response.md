To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `n` is the integer value from the input data.
- `k` is the integer value from the input data.
- `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` is less than or equal to `max_ones`.
- `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `range(n)` generates at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 0.
3. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` will start at 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is less than or equal to `max_ones`, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with all elements initialized to 0**
