To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0)`.
- `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with `matrix[0][0]` set to 1.
- For each `j` from 1 to `n - 1`:
  - If `k` was initially greater than or equal to 2, both `matrix[0][j]` and `matrix[j][0]` are set to 1.
  - If `k` was exactly 1, only `matrix[0][j]` is set to 1 for the last iteration where `k` was 1.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `i < n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is a fixed value.

### New State:
- `i` is now 1.
- `n` is still greater than 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0)`, and `matrix` is an `n` by `n` matrix with `matrix[0][0]` set to 1. For each `j` from 1 to `n - 1`, if `k` was initially greater than or equal to 2, both `matrix[0][j]` and `matrix[j][0]` are set to 1. If `k` was exactly 1, only `matrix[0][j]` is set to 1 for the last iteration where `k` was 1.**
