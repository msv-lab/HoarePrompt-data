Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `max_ones` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `matrix[1][2]` and `matrix[2][1]` are set to 1, and `k` is updated to `k - 2`. If `k` is 1, `matrix[1][2]` is set to 1, and `k` is updated to `k - 1`. If `k` is less than 2 but greater than 0, `k` is updated to `max(k - 2 * (n - 1), 0) - 1`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
