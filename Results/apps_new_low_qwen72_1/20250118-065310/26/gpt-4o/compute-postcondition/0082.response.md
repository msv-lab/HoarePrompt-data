To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j`.
   - The loop condition depends on `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 3.
   - If `k` >= 2, `matrix[2][3]` is 1, `matrix[3][2]` is 1.
   - If `k` < 2, `matrix[2][3]` is 1.
   - If `k` == 1, `k` is set to 0.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `(i + 1, n)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 4.
   - The loop will execute again if `j` (which is now 4) is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `j` should be incremented to 4.
   - The condition `j < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `n` is greater than 3, it must be at least 5 for `j` to be 4 and the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If `k` >= 2, `matrix[2][3]` is 1, `matrix[3][2]` is 1. If `k` < 2, `matrix[2][3]` is 1. If `k` == 1, `k` is set to 0.**
