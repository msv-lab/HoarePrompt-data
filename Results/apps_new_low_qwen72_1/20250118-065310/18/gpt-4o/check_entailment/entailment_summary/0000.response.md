Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining how many spectators are standing at a given time `t` during a Mexican wave. The logic of the program is based on the following conditions:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is equal to `t`. This is because each new spectator stands until `k` spectators have stood.
2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`. This is because the wave has reached its maximum width of `k` standing spectators.
3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the number of standing spectators decreases as the wave starts to collapse. The formula used is `n + k - t`, which correctly calculates the number of spectators still standing after the wave has started to sit down.

However, the execution summary mentions that the function does not handle cases where the input values do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `t` is not within the range `1 â‰¤ t < n + k`). While this is true, the problem statement explicitly states that the input will be valid according to the given constraints. Therefore, we can assume that the input will always be within the valid range, and the program does not need to handle invalid input.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic for the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
