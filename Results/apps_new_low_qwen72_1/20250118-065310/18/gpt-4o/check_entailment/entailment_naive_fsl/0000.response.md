Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when `t` is greater than `n + k`. According to the problem description, at time `t = n + k`, the last spectator sits, and after this time, no spectators are standing. However, the program does not account for this and will incorrectly output a positive number of standing spectators for `t > n + k`.

For example:
- Input: `10 5 16`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Program's Output: `-1` (which is incorrect)

This indicates that the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, specifically when `t > n + k`.
