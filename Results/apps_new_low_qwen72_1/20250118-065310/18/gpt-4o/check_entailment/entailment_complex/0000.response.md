### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that the input values `n`, `k`, and `t` are valid and meet the specified constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`). This is a reasonable assumption based on the problem statement.

2. **Logic Breakdown**:
   - **Case 1**: `t <= k`
     - If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, then the number of spectators standing is exactly `t`. This is because the first `k` spectators stand one by one.
   - **Case 2**: `t <= n`
     - If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, then all `k` spectators who stood up initially are still standing. Therefore, the number of standing spectators is `k`.
   - **Case 3**: `t > n`
     - If `t` is greater than `n`, then the wave has started to roll back. The number of standing spectators decreases as the first few spectators who stood up begin to sit down. The number of standing spectators at this point is `n + k - t`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `t` is at the boundaries of the specified ranges. For example, when `t = k`, it prints `k`, and when `t = n + k - 1`, it prints `1`.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples:
     - For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 3`, the output is `3`.
     - For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 7`, the output is `5`.
     - For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12`, the output is `3`.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
