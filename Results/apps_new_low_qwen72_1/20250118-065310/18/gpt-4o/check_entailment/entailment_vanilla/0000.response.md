Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the three distinct cases for calculating the number of spectators standing at any given time `t`:

1. When `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators increases linearly with each passing time unit, starting from 1 up to `k`. Thus, the number of standing spectators at time `t` is simply `t`.

2. When `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k` because new spectators keep standing up while the ones who stood earlier have not yet started to sit down.

3. When `t` is greater than `n`, the number of standing spectators starts to decrease as the spectators who stood up first begin to sit down. The formula `n + k - t` correctly calculates the number of spectators still standing by subtracting the excess time over `n` from `k`.

Each case is handled appropriately according to the rules described in the problem statement, and the logic matches the expected behavior of the Mexican wave. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
