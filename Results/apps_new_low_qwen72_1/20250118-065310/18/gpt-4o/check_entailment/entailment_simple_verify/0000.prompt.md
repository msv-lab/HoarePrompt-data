You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if (t <= k) :
        print(t)
    else :
        if (t <= n) :
            print(k)
        else :
            print(n + k - t)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. If `t` ≤ `n`, the state remains unchanged. If `t` > `n`, the value `n + k - t` is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer. If `t` ≤ `k`, `t` has been printed. If `t` > `k` and `t` ≤ `n`, the state remains unchanged. If `t` > `n`, the value `n + k - t` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when `t` is greater than `n + k`. According to the problem description, at time `t = n + k`, the last spectator sits, and after this time, no spectators are standing. However, the program does not account for this and will incorrectly output a positive number of standing spectators for `t > n + k`.

For example:
- Input: `10 5 16`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Program's Output: `-1` (which is incorrect)

This indicates that the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, specifically when `t > n + k`.
