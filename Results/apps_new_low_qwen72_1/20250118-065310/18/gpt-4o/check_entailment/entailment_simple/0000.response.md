### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The function starts by taking three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` from the input, which is consistent with the problem statement that these values are provided in the first line of input.

2. **Initial Condition (t ≤ k)**:
   - If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is simply `t`. This is because the first `k` spectators stand one by one, and no one has sat down yet.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

3. **Intermediate Condition (k < t ≤ n)**:
   - If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, all `k` spectators who have stood up remain standing, and no one has started sitting down yet.
   - Therefore, the number of standing spectators is `k`.
   - This part of the logic is also correct.

4. **Final Condition (t > n)**:
   - If `t` is greater than `n`, the wave has completed its initial standing phase, and some spectators have started sitting down.
   - The number of standing spectators is calculated as `n + k - t`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that after `t = n`, the wave continues for `k` more steps before everyone sits down. So, the number of standing spectators decreases linearly from `k` to `0` over the next `k` steps.
   - This part of the logic is also correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The conditions cover all possible values of `t` within the given range `1 ≤ t < n + k`.
   - The program handles the transition between different phases of the wave correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the number of standing spectators at any given time `t` based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
