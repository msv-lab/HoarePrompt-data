The value of `k` is printed, and no variables are modified by this code. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, and `t` is greater than `k`. Additionally, the current value of `t` is less than or equal to `n`.**
