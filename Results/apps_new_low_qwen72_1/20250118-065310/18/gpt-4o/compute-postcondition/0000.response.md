The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are reassigned based on the input provided by the user. The input is split and converted to integers, and these new values replace the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `t`. The constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k remain valid for the new values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer**
