Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer. If `t` ≤ `k`, `t` has been printed. If `t` > `k` and `t` ≤ `n`, the state remains unchanged. If `t` > `n`, the value `n + k - t` is printed.***
