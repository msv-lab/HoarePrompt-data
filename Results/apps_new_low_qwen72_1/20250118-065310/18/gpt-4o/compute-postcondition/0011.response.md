Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`. Based on the value of `t` relative to `k` and `n`, it prints one of the following values:
- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`.
- If `t` is greater than `k` and less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`.
- If `t` is greater than `n`, it prints `n + k - t`.

After the function executes, the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged, but one of the above values is printed to the console. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- When `t` is exactly equal to `k`, the function prints `k` (which is the same as `t` in this case).
- When `t` is exactly equal to `n`, the function prints `k`.
- When `t` is exactly equal to `n + k`, the function prints `0`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the input values do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `t` is not within the range `1 ≤ t < n + k`). In such cases, the behavior of the function is undefined. **
