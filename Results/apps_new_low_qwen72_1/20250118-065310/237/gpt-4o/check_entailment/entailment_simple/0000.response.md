### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` and strips any leading/trailing whitespace. This is correct and aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Counting Pearls and Links**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of pearls (`pearl_count`) and links (`link_count`) in the string `s`.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If there are 0 or 1 pearls, the program prints "YES". This is correct because:
     - If there are 0 pearls, there are no pearls to consider, so the condition is trivially satisfied.
     - If there is 1 pearl, there are no other pearls to compare, so the condition is also trivially satisfied.

4. **Main Condition**:
   - For more than 1 pearl, the program checks if the number of links (`link_count`) is divisible by the number of pearls (`pearl_count`). This is correct because:
     - If `link_count % pearl_count == 0`, it means the links can be evenly distributed between the pearls, making the number of links between each pair of adjacent pearls equal.
     - If `link_count % pearl_count != 0`, it means the links cannot be evenly distributed, and thus it is impossible to make the number of links between each pair of adjacent pearls equal.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints "NO". This is correct and matches the problem's output requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the links and pearls can be rearranged to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
