Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly takes a single line of input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `s`.

2. **Pearl Count and Link Count Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the number of pearls (`pearl_count`) and the number of links (`link_count`) in the input string.

3. **Edge Cases for Pearl Count**:
   - If `pearl_count` is 0 or 1, the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because:
     - If there are no pearls, the condition of having an equal number of links between adjacent pearls is trivially satisfied.
     - If there is exactly one pearl, there are no adjacent pearls, so the condition is also trivially satisfied.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - If `pearl_count` is greater than 1, the program checks if `link_count` is a multiple of `pearl_count`.
   - If `link_count % pearl_count == 0`, the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the total number of links is evenly divisible by the number of pearls, it is possible to distribute the links equally between each pair of adjacent pearls.
   - Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the total number of links is not a multiple of the number of pearls, it is impossible to distribute the links equally between each pair of adjacent pearls.

5. **State of the Program**:
   - The program correctly maintains the state of `s`, `pearl_count`, and `link_count` throughout its execution.
   - The final output is determined based on the logic described above, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
