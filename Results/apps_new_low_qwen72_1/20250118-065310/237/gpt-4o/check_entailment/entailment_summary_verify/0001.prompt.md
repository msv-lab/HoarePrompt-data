You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A necklace can be described as a string of links ('-') and pearls ('o'), with the last link or pearl connected to the first one. $0$ 

You can remove a link or a pearl and insert it between two other existing links or pearls (or between a link and a pearl) on the necklace. This process can be repeated as many times as you like, but you can't throw away any parts.

Can you make the number of links between every two adjacent pearls equal? Two pearls are considered to be adjacent if there is no other pearl between them.

Note that the final necklace should remain as one circular part of the same length as the initial necklace.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a string $s$ ($3 \leq |s| \leq 100$), representing the necklace, where a dash '-' represents a link and the lowercase English letter 'o' represents a pearl.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the links and pearls can be rejoined such that the number of links between adjacent pearls is equal. Otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
-o-o--
Output
YES
Input
-o---

Output
YES
Input
-o---o-

Output
NO
Input
ooo

Output
YES

- Program:
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    pearl_count = s.count('o')
    link_count = s.count('-')
    if pearl_count == 0 or pearl_count == 1:
        print('YES')
    elif link_count % pearl_count == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a string `s` from user input, which consists of characters '-' and 'o', where the length of `s` is between 3 and 100, inclusive. It then counts the number of 'o' characters (`pearl_count`) and the number of '-' characters (`link_count`). If `pearl_count` is 0 or 1, the function prints 'YES'. If `pearl_count` is greater than 1, the function checks if `link_count` is a multiple of `pearl_count`. If it is, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the values of `pearl_count` and `link_count` are determined based on the input string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `input().strip()`. This ensures that the input string is processed as intended without unnecessary spaces.

2. **Pearl and Link Counting**: The program uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of 'o' (pearls) and '-' (links) in the string `s`. This is an efficient and correct way to get the counts of pearls and links.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If there are no pearls (`pearl_count == 0`), the program correctly prints 'YES'. This is because a necklace with no pearls is trivially balanced.
   - If there is exactly one pearl (`pearl_count == 1`), the program also correctly prints 'YES'. This is because a single pearl can be placed anywhere on the necklace, and the condition of having equal links between pearls is trivially satisfied.

4. **Main Condition**:
   - The program checks if the number of links is divisible by the number of pearls (`link_count % pearl_count == 0`). This condition ensures that the links can be evenly distributed between the pearls.
   - If this condition is met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - If the condition is not met, the program prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as a necklace with no links or a necklace with no pearls correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the number of links is not divisible by the number of pearls, which would result in an unbalanced necklace.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
