Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical error in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the condition `elif link_count % pearl_count == 0:` is incorrect. The program checks if the total number of links is divisible by the number of pearls, which is not sufficient to ensure that the links can be evenly distributed between each pair of adjacent pearls.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input: `-o--o-`

- **Pearl Count**: 2
- **Link Count**: 4

According to the program's logic:
- `link_count % pearl_count == 4 % 2 == 0`, so the program would output "YES".

However, the correct output should be "NO" because it is impossible to rearrange the necklace such that the number of links between every two adjacent pearls is equal. The only way to distribute 4 links between 2 pearls is to have 2 links between them, but this would leave the necklace open, violating the requirement that the necklace remains a closed loop.

Thus, the program fails to handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
