Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `input().strip()`. This ensures that the input string is processed as intended without unnecessary spaces.

2. **Pearl and Link Counting**: The program uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of 'o' (pearls) and '-' (links) in the string `s`. This is an efficient and correct way to get the counts of pearls and links.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If there are no pearls (`pearl_count == 0`), the program correctly prints 'YES'. This is because a necklace with no pearls is trivially balanced.
   - If there is exactly one pearl (`pearl_count == 1`), the program also correctly prints 'YES'. This is because a single pearl can be placed anywhere on the necklace, and the condition of having equal links between pearls is trivially satisfied.

4. **Main Condition**:
   - The program checks if the number of links is divisible by the number of pearls (`link_count % pearl_count == 0`). This condition ensures that the links can be evenly distributed between the pearls.
   - If this condition is met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - If the condition is not met, the program prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as a necklace with no links or a necklace with no pearls correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the number of links is not divisible by the number of pearls, which would result in an unbalanced necklace.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes the input and counts the pearls and links.
   - The annotations also confirm that the program correctly handles the special cases and the main condition.
   - The final state of the program is consistent with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Given the above reasoning and the annotated code, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
