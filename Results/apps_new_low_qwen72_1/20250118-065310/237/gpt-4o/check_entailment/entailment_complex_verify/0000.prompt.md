You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A necklace can be described as a string of links ('-') and pearls ('o'), with the last link or pearl connected to the first one. $0$ 

You can remove a link or a pearl and insert it between two other existing links or pearls (or between a link and a pearl) on the necklace. This process can be repeated as many times as you like, but you can't throw away any parts.

Can you make the number of links between every two adjacent pearls equal? Two pearls are considered to be adjacent if there is no other pearl between them.

Note that the final necklace should remain as one circular part of the same length as the initial necklace.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a string $s$ ($3 \leq |s| \leq 100$), representing the necklace, where a dash '-' represents a link and the lowercase English letter 'o' represents a pearl.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the links and pearls can be rejoined such that the number of links between adjacent pearls is equal. Otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
-o-o--
Output
YES
Input
-o---

Output
YES
Input
-o---o-

Output
NO
Input
ooo

Output
YES

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    pearl_count = s.count('o')
    link_count = s.count('-')
    if pearl_count == 0 or pearl_count == 1:
        print('YES')
    elif link_count % pearl_count == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string s consisting of characters '-' and 'o', where 3 ≤ |s| ≤ 100, representing a necklace.
def func():
    s = input().strip()

pearl_count = s.count('o')

link_count = s.count('-')
    if (pearl_count == 0 or pearl_count == 1) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (link_count % pearl_count == 0) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string of length between 3 and 100 consisting of characters '-' and 'o', `pearl_count` is the number of 'o' characters in `s`, and `link_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`. `pearl_count` is greater than 1. If `link_count` is a multiple of `pearl_count`, no action is taken. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string of length between 3 and 100 consisting of characters '-' and 'o', `pearl_count` is the number of 'o' characters in `s`, and `link_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`. If `pearl_count` is 0 or 1, no action is taken. If `pearl_count` is greater than 1, and `link_count` is a multiple of `pearl_count`, no action is taken. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a string `s` from user input, which consists of characters '-' and 'o', where the length of `s` is between 3 and 100, inclusive. It then counts the number of 'o' characters (`pearl_count`) and the number of '-' characters (`link_count`). If `pearl_count` is 0 or 1, the function prints 'YES'. If `pearl_count` is greater than 1, the function checks if `link_count` is a multiple of `pearl_count`. If it is, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the values of `pearl_count` and `link_count` are determined based on the input string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical error in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the condition `elif link_count % pearl_count == 0:` is incorrect. The program checks if the total number of links is divisible by the number of pearls, which is not sufficient to ensure that the links can be evenly distributed between each pair of adjacent pearls.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input: `-o--o-`

- **Pearl Count**: 2
- **Link Count**: 4

According to the program's logic:
- `link_count % pearl_count == 4 % 2 == 0`, so the program would output "YES".

However, the correct output should be "NO" because it is impossible to rearrange the necklace such that the number of links between every two adjacent pearls is equal. The only way to distribute 4 links between 2 pearls is to have 2 links between them, but this would leave the necklace open, violating the requirement that the necklace remains a closed loop.

Thus, the program fails to handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
