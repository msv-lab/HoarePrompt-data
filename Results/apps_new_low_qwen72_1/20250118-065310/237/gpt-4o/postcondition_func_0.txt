The function `func` reads a string `s` from user input, which consists of characters '-' and 'o', where the length of `s` is between 3 and 100, inclusive. It then counts the number of 'o' characters (`pearl_count`) and the number of '-' characters (`link_count`). If `pearl_count` is 0 or 1, the function prints 'YES'. If `pearl_count` is greater than 1, the function checks if `link_count` is a multiple of `pearl_count`. If it is, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the values of `pearl_count` and `link_count` are determined based on the input string.
