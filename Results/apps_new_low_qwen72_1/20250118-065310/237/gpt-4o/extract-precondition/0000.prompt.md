You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: A necklace can be described as a string of links ('-') and pearls ('o'), with the last link or pearl connected to the first one. $0$ 

You can remove a link or a pearl and insert it between two other existing links or pearls (or between a link and a pearl) on the necklace. This process can be repeated as many times as you like, but you can't throw away any parts.

Can you make the number of links between every two adjacent pearls equal? Two pearls are considered to be adjacent if there is no other pearl between them.

Note that the final necklace should remain as one circular part of the same length as the initial necklace.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a string $s$ ($3 \leq |s| \leq 100$), representing the necklace, where a dash '-' represents a link and the lowercase English letter 'o' represents a pearl.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the links and pearls can be rejoined such that the number of links between adjacent pearls is equal. Otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
-o-o--
Output

Input
-o---

Output
YES
Input
-o---o-

Output
NO
