The code snippet `print('YES')` simply outputs the string 'YES' to the console. This operation does not alter any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **s is a string of length between 3 and 100 consisting of characters '-' and 'o', pearl_count is the number of 'o' characters in s, link_count is the number of '-' characters in s, and either pearl_count is 0 or pearl_count is 1.**
