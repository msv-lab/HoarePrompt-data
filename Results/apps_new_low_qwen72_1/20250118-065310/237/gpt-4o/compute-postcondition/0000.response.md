The provided code snippet reads a string `s` from the input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then counts the occurrences of 'o' and '-' in the string, storing these counts in `pearl_count` and `link_count`, respectively.

Given the initial state where `s` is a string consisting of characters '-' and 'o' with a length between 3 and 100, the code will update the values of `pearl_count` and `link_count` based on the content of `s`.

Output State: **s is a string of length between 3 and 100 consisting of characters '-' and 'o', pearl_count is the number of 'o' characters in s, link_count is the number of '-' characters in s**
