The function `func` accepts no parameters. Instead, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the provided example since the function signature does not include any parameters, but the description mentions an input string `s`. Assuming the correct function signature should include the parameter `s`, the function would accept a string `s` consisting of characters '-' and 'o', where the length of `s` is between 3 and 100, inclusive, representing a necklace.

Given the corrected function signature:
```
def func(s):
```

The output is not specified in the provided information. However, if we assume that the function's purpose is to determine some property of the necklace (for example, whether it is symmetric or the count of certain patterns), the output would depend on the specific logic implemented within the function. Without the exact output criteria, I can only describe the function's input and a general form of its expected output.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '-' and 'o', where the length of `s` is between 3 and 100, inclusive, representing a necklace. The function returns a value based on the properties of the string `s`, but the specific return value depends on the implementation details not provided here.**
