Output State: **n is 4, vertices is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i), x_coords is {x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3}, y_coords is {y_0, y_1, y_2, y_3}, x is x_3, y is y_3**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over the `vertices` list, which contains 4 tuples. For each tuple `(x, y)`, it adds `x` to `x_coords` and `y` to `y_coords`.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `n` remains constant at 4.
   - `vertices` remains unchanged as it is only being iterated over.
   - `x_coords` and `y_coords` grow with each iteration, adding unique `x` and `y` values from `vertices`.
   - `x` and `y` are the current elements from `vertices` being processed.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: After 4 iterations (one for each tuple in `vertices`), `x_coords` will contain all unique `x` values from `vertices`, and `y_coords` will contain all unique `y` values from `vertices`. The loop will execute exactly 4 times because there are 4 tuples in `vertices`.
4. **Verify Relationships**: The loop will add each `x` and `y` value from `vertices` to `x_coords` and `y_coords` respectively. Since there are 4 tuples, `x_coords` and `y_coords` will each contain 4 unique values (assuming no duplicates in `vertices`).

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:
- `n` is 4
- `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i)
- `x_coords` is {x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3}
- `y_coords` is {y_0, y_1, y_2, y_3}
- `x` is x_3
- `y` is y_3
