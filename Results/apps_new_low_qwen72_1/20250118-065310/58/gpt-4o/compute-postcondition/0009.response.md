The provided code adds the x and y values from the first tuple in the `vertices` list to the sets `x_coords` and `y_coords`, respectively. Since `x` and `y` are initialized as the first tuple in the `vertices` list, their values are added to the respective sets. The initial state specifies that `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, and `x_coords` and `y_coords` start as empty sets.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 4
- `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i)
- `x_coords` is an empty set
- `y_coords` is an empty set
- `x` and `y` are the first tuple in the `vertices` list

After executing the code:
- `x_coords` contains the x-coordinate from the first tuple in `vertices`
- `y_coords` contains the y-coordinate from the first tuple in `vertices`

Let's assume the first tuple in `vertices` is `(x_0, y_0)`. After the code execution:
- `x_coords` will contain `{x_0}`
- `y_coords` will contain `{y_0}`

The values of `n`, `vertices`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is 4, vertices is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i), x_coords is {x_0}, y_coords is {y_0}, x is x_0, y is y_0**
