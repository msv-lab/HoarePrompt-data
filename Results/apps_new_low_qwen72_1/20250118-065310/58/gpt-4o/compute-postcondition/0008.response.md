To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is 4
- `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i) within the specified range
- `x_coords` is an empty set
- `y_coords` is an empty set

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in vertices:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variables**: The loop iterates over the `vertices` list. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `vertices` list.
2. **Initial State**: Before the loop starts, `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples. This means the loop has 4 iterations to go through.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute the First Time:
- The `vertices` list must not be empty. Since we know `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, this condition is already satisfied.
- The first tuple in the `vertices` list will be unpacked into `x` and `y`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains 4.
- `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i).
- `x_coords` is an empty set.
- `y_coords` is an empty set.
- `x` and `y` will be the first tuple in the `vertices` list.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the `vertices` list must contain at least one tuple. Since it contains 4 tuples, the loop will definitely execute. The initial values of `x` and `y` will be the first tuple in the `vertices` list.

State: **`n` is 4, `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i), `x_coords` is an empty set, `y_coords` is an empty set, `x` and `y` are the first tuple in the `vertices` list**
