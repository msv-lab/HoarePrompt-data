You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4, and vertices is a list of n tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the vertices. The vertices are distinct and form part of a rectangle with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
def func_1(n, vertices):
    if (n == 1 or n == 3) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    else :
        if (n == 2) :
            x1, y1 = vertices[0]

x2, y2 = vertices[1]
            return abs(x2 - x1) * abs(y2 - y1)
            #The program returns the absolute difference between x2 and x1 multiplied by the absolute difference between y2 and y1.
        else :
            x_coords = set()

y_coords = set()
            for (x, y) in vertices:
                x_coords.add(x)
                
                y_coords.add(y)
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is 4, vertices is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i), x_coords is {x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3}, y_coords is {y_0, y_1, y_2, y_3}, x is x_3, y is y_3
            if (len(x_coords) == 2 and len(y_coords) == 2) :
                return abs(max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)) * abs(max(y_coords) - min(y_coords))
                #The program returns the area calculated as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates multiplied by the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. Given that the lengths of x_coords and y_coords are both 2, the area is the product of the differences between the two unique x-coordinates and the two unique y-coordinates.
            else :
                return -1
                #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples `vertices`. It returns `-1` in certain cases, the product of the absolute differences between specific x and y coordinates in another case, or the area of the rectangle formed by the vertices in the remaining case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns the absolute difference between x2 and x1 multiplied by the absolute difference between y2 and y1.

Case_3: The program returns the area calculated as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates multiplied by the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. Given that the lengths of x_coords and y_coords are both 2, the area is the product of the differences between the two unique x-coordinates and the two unique y-coordinates.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
