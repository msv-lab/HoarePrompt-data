The provided code snippet adds the values of `x` and `y` to the sets `x_coords` and `y_coords`, respectively. Initially, `x_coords` contains `{x_0}` and `y_coords` contains `{y_0}`, and `x` is set to `x_1` while `y` is set to `y_1`. After executing the code, `x_coords` will include both `x_0` and `x_1`, and `y_coords` will include both `y_0` and `y_1`.

Output State: **n is 4, vertices is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i), x_coords is {x_0, x_1}, y_coords is {y_0, y_1}, x is x_1, y is y_1**
