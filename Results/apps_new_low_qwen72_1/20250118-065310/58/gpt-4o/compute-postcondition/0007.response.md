The provided code initializes two sets, `x_coords` and `y_coords`, which are intended to store unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the list of vertices, respectively. However, the code snippet does not include any operations that add elements to these sets or modify any other variables. Therefore, the sets remain empty after the code execution, and the initial state of the variables `n` and `vertices` remains unchanged.

Initial State:
- `n` is 4
- `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i) within the specified range, representing the coordinates of the vertices of a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Code Execution:
- `x_coords = set()`: Initializes an empty set `x_coords`.
- `y_coords = set()`: Initializes an empty set `y_coords`.

Since no further operations are performed on these sets or any other variables, the state of the program remains as it was initially, except for the addition of the two empty sets.

Output State: **n is 4, vertices is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i) within the specified range, x_coords is an empty set, y_coords is an empty set**
