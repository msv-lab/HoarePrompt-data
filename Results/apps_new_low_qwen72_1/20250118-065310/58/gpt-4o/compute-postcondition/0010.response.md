The only objects in the loop head are variables `x`, `y`, and the list `vertices`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `vertices`. If there are more elements in `vertices`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, `x` is `x_0`, and `y` is `y_0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `vertices` will be processed, which means `x` and `y` will take the values of the next tuple in the list.

Since the first element `(x_0, y_0)` has already been processed, the next element in the list will be the second tuple, say `(x_1, y_1)`.

State: **`n` is 4, `vertices` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i), `x_coords` is {x_0}, `y_coords` is {y_0}, `x` is `x_1`, `y` is `y_1`**
