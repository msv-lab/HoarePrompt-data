The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `vertices`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4, and `vertices` is a list of `n` tuples, each containing two integers `(x_i, y_i)` where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the vertices. The vertices are distinct and form part of a rectangle with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

- **Case_1**: The program returns `-1`.
- **Case_2**: The program returns the absolute difference between `x2` and `x1` multiplied by the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- **Case_3**: The program returns the area calculated as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates multiplied by the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. Given that the lengths of `x_coords` and `y_coords` are both 2, the area is the product of the differences between the two unique x-coordinates and the two unique y-coordinates.
- **Case_4**: The program returns `-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples `vertices`. It returns `-1` in certain cases, the product of the absolute differences between specific x and y coordinates in another case, or the area of the rectangle formed by the vertices in the remaining case.**
