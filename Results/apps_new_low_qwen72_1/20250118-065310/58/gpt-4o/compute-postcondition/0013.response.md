The provided code adds the value of `x` (which is `x_2`) to the set `x_coords` and the value of `y` (which is `y_2`) to the set `y_coords`. Since `x_coords` initially contains `{x_0, x_1}` and `y_coords` contains `{y_0, y_1}`, after adding `x_2` to `x_coords` and `y_2` to `y_coords`, these sets will include these new values. The variables `n` and `vertices` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is 4, vertices is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i), x_coords is {x_0, x_1, x_2}, y_coords is {y_0, y_1, y_2}, x is x_2, y is y_2**
