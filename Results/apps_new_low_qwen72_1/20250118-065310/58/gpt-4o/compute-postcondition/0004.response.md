The provided code snippet unpacks the first tuple in the `vertices` list into variables `x1` and `y1`, and the second tuple into variables `x2` and `y2`. Given the initial state where `n` is 2 and `vertices` contains exactly 2 tuples, each tuple representing the coordinates of the vertices of a rectangle, the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will take the values from these tuples.

Since the exact values of the tuples in `vertices` are not specified, we can only describe the final state in terms of the values they contain. However, it is known that each tuple contains two integers within the range -1000 to 1000, and the vertices are distinct and form part of a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Output State: **n is 2, vertices is a list of 2 tuples, x1 is the x-coordinate of the first vertex, y1 is the y-coordinate of the first vertex, x2 is the x-coordinate of the second vertex, y2 is the y-coordinate of the second vertex**
