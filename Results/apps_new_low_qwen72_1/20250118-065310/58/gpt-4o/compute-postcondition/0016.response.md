Output State: **The program returns the area calculated as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates multiplied by the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. Given that the lengths of x_coords and y_coords are both 2, the area is the product of the differences between the two unique x-coordinates and the two unique y-coordinates.**
