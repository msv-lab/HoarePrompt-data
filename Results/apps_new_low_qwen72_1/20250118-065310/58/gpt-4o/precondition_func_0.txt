n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4, and vertices is a list of n tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the vertices. The vertices are distinct and form part of a rectangle with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
