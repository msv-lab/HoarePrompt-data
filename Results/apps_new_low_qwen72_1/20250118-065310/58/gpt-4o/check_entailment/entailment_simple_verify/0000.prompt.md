You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
After making bad dives into swimming pools, Wilbur wants to build a swimming pool in the shape of a rectangle in his backyard. He has set up coordinate axes, and he wants the sides of the rectangle to be parallel to them. Of course, the area of the rectangle must be positive. Wilbur had all four vertices of the planned pool written on a paper, until his friend came along and erased some of the vertices.

Now Wilbur is wondering, if the remaining n vertices of the initial rectangle give enough information to restore the area of the planned swimming pool.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4) — the number of vertices that were not erased by Wilbur's friend.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} ( - 1000 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 1000) —the coordinates of the i-th vertex that remains. Vertices are given in an arbitrary order.

It's guaranteed that these points are distinct vertices of some rectangle, that has positive area and which sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.


-----Output-----

Print the area of the initial rectangle if it could be uniquely determined by the points remaining. Otherwise, print  - 1. 


-----Examples-----
Input
2
0 0
1 1

Output
1

Input
1
1 1

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, two opposite corners of the initial rectangle are given, and that gives enough information to say that the rectangle is actually a unit square.

In the second sample there is only one vertex left and this is definitely not enough to uniquely define the area.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program incorrectly returns `-1` for the case when `n == 3`. According to the problem description, if three vertices of a rectangle are given, the fourth vertex can be uniquely determined, and thus the area of the rectangle can also be uniquely determined. However, the function `func_1` returns `-1` when `n == 3`, which is incorrect.

Example of incorrect behavior:
For the input:
```
3
0 0
1 0
0 1
```
The output should be `1` because the fourth vertex `(1, 1)` can be deduced, and the area of the rectangle is `1`. However, the program returns `-1`.

To fix this, the function should handle the case where `n == 3` by calculating the fourth vertex and then computing the area.
