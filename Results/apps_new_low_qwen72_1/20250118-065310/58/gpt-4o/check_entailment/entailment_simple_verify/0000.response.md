### Reasoning:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **n == 1**: The program correctly returns `-1` because a single vertex is insufficient to determine the area of the rectangle.
   - **n == 2**: The program correctly calculates the area using the two given vertices, assuming they are opposite corners of the rectangle.
   - **n == 3**: The program incorrectly returns `-1`. As noted in the original assessment, if three vertices are given, the fourth vertex can be uniquely determined, and thus the area can be calculated.
   - **n == 4**: The program correctly calculates the area by ensuring there are exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates, and then computing the area using the differences between these coordinates.

2. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **n == 3**: Given three vertices, the fourth vertex can be determined by the fact that the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. For example, if the given vertices are \((x1, y1)\), \((x2, y2)\), and \((x3, y3)\), the fourth vertex can be found by ensuring that the x-coordinates and y-coordinates are consistent with the properties of a rectangle. Specifically, if two vertices share the same x-coordinate, the fourth vertex will have the same x-coordinate as the third vertex and the same y-coordinate as the other two. Similarly, if two vertices share the same y-coordinate, the fourth vertex will have the same y-coordinate as the third vertex and the same x-coordinate as the other two.

3. **Example**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     3
     0 0
     1 0
     0 1
     ```
     The fourth vertex is \((1, 1)\). The area of the rectangle is \(1\). The current program returns `-1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where `n == 3` properly. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
