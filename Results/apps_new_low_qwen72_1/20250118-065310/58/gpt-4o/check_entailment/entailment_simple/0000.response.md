Reasoning:  

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and processes it into a list of vertices. This ensures that the data is in the expected format before any processing occurs.
   
2. **Single Vertex Case (n=1)**: If only one vertex is provided, the area cannot be uniquely determined because there is no information about the dimensions of the rectangle. The program correctly returns `-1` in this case.

3. **Three Vertices Case (n=3)**: If three vertices are provided, the fourth vertex can be deduced, but the area of the rectangle can still be uniquely determined by using the distances between the existing vertices. However, the program incorrectly returns `-1` in this case. This is a mistake because with three vertices, the fourth can be inferred, and the area can be calculated.

4. **Two Vertices Case (n=2)**: If two vertices are provided, the program correctly calculates the area by assuming that the two points are diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle. The area is calculated as the product of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates. This is correct because the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes.

5. **Four Vertices Case (n=4)**: If all four vertices are provided, the program checks if there are exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates. This ensures that the points form a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes. The area is then calculated as the product of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. This is correct.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as duplicate coordinates by ensuring that the sets `x_coords` and `y_coords` contain only unique values. This prevents incorrect area calculations due to repeated points.

However, the program has a logical error in the case where `n == 3`. With three vertices, the area can still be uniquely determined, but the program incorrectly returns `-1`.

Given this reasoning, the program is not entirely correct due to the issue with the `n == 3` case.

Correctness: **False**
