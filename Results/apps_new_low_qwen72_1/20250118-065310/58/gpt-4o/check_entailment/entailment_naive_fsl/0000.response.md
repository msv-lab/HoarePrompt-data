Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program incorrectly returns `-1` for the case when `n == 3`. According to the problem description, if three vertices of a rectangle are given, the fourth vertex can be uniquely determined, and thus the area of the rectangle can also be uniquely determined. However, the function `func_1` returns `-1` when `n == 3`, which is incorrect.

Example of incorrect behavior:
For the input:
```
3
0 0
1 0
0 1
```
The output should be `1` because the fourth vertex `(1, 1)` can be deduced, and the area of the rectangle is `1`. However, the program returns `-1`.

To fix this, the function should handle the case where `n == 3` by calculating the fourth vertex and then computing the area.
