### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It extracts the number of vertices `n` and the coordinates of the vertices.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Case `n == 1` or `n == 3`:**
     - The function returns `-1` for these cases.
     - For `n == 1`, it is correct because a single vertex does not provide enough information to determine the area of the rectangle.
     - For `n == 3`, the function returns `-1`, but this is incorrect. According to the problem description, if three vertices are given, the fourth vertex can be uniquely determined, and thus the area can be calculated.

   - **Case `n == 2`:**
     - The function calculates the area as the product of the absolute differences of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two vertices.
     - This is correct because two opposite vertices of a rectangle are sufficient to determine its area.

   - **Case `n == 4`:**
     - The function checks if there are exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates.
     - If so, it calculates the area as the product of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
     - This is correct because four vertices of a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes will have exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` returns `-1` for the case when `n == 3`, which is incorrect. The function should be able to calculate the area when three vertices are given.

### Corrected Function:

To fix the issue, we need to add logic to handle the case when `n == 3`. We can determine the fourth vertex and then calculate the area.

```python
def func_1(n, vertices):
    if n == 1:
        return -1
    elif n == 2:
        (x1, y1) = vertices[0]
        (x2, y2) = vertices[1]
        return abs(x2 - x1) * abs(y2 - y1)
    elif n == 3:
        # Determine the fourth vertex
        x_coords = set()
        y_coords = set()
        for (x, y) in vertices:
            x_coords.add(x)
            y_coords.add(y)
        
        # There should be exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates
        if len(x_coords) != 2 or len(y_coords) != 2:
            return -1
        
        # Calculate the fourth vertex
        x_coords_list = list(x_coords)
        y_coords_list = list(y_coords)
        fourth_vertex = (x_coords_list[0] if vertices[0][0] != x_coords_list[0] else x_coords_list[1],
                        y_coords_list[0] if vertices[0][1] != y_coords_list[0] else y_coords_list[1])
        
        # Calculate the area
        return abs(fourth_vertex[0] - vertices[0][0]) * abs(fourth_vertex[1] - vertices[0][1])
    else:  # n == 4
        x_coords = set()
        y_coords = set()
        for (x, y) in vertices:
            x_coords.add(x)
            y_coords.add(y)
        if len(x_coords) == 2 and len(y_coords) == 2:
            return abs(max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)) * abs(max(y_coords) - min(y_coords))
        else:
            return -1
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issue with the case when `n == 3`. The function `func_1` needs to be corrected to handle this case properly.

Final: **False** (The given program is incorrect due to the handling of the `n == 3` case.)
