Reasoning:  
The provided solution appears to correctly address the problem requirements. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it, and processes it to extract the number of vertices `n` and the coordinates of the vertices. This is a common approach for handling input in competitive programming.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - **Case `n == 1` or `n == 3`**: The function returns `-1` because with only one or three vertices, it is impossible to uniquely determine the area of the rectangle.
   - **Case `n == 2`**: The function calculates the area using the two given vertices. Since the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes, the area is simply the product of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two vertices.
   - **Case `n == 4`**: The function checks if there are exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates. If so, it calculates the area using the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates. If not, it returns `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 or 3 by returning `-1`.
   - For `n == 2`, it correctly calculates the area if the two points are opposite corners of the rectangle.
   - For `n == 4`, it correctly identifies whether the points form a valid rectangle and calculates the area accordingly.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - The function assumes that the input is valid and follows the problem constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 4, and the vertices form a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes). This is a reasonable assumption based on the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program seems to meet the requirements of the problem and handles all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
