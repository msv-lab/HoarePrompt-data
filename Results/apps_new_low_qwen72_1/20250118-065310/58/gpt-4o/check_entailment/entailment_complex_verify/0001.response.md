### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then converts the first element to an integer to get the number of vertices `n`.
   - It iterates through the remaining elements in pairs to form the coordinates of the vertices and appends them to the `vertices` list.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Case `n == 1`**: If only one vertex is given, it is impossible to determine the area of the rectangle. The function correctly returns `-1`.
   - **Case `n == 3`**: If three vertices are given, it is also impossible to uniquely determine the area of the rectangle because the fourth vertex could be any of the remaining possible positions. The function correctly returns `-1`.
   - **Case `n == 2`**: If two vertices are given, the function calculates the area by assuming these two vertices are opposite corners of the rectangle. This is correct because the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. The area is calculated as the product of the absolute differences of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
   - **Case `n == 4`**: If all four vertices are given, the function checks if there are exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates. If so, it calculates the area by finding the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates, and then computing the product of their differences. This is correct because it ensures the vertices form a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when only one vertex is given, when three vertices are given, and when all four vertices are given.
   - The function correctly identifies and handles the case where the vertices do not form a valid rectangle (e.g., more than two unique x-coordinates or y-coordinates).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the area of the rectangle based on the given vertices. It handles all specified cases and edge conditions appropriately.

Final: **True**
