Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The program incorrectly handles the case when `n == 3`. When three vertices of a rectangle are given, the fourth vertex can indeed be uniquely determined, and thus the area of the rectangle can be calculated. The current implementation of `func_1` returns `-1` for `n == 3`, which is incorrect. This oversight means that the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for this specific case.

To illustrate this, consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
3
0 0
1 0
0 1
```
The fourth vertex can be deduced as `(1, 1)`, and the area of the rectangle is `1`. However, the program returns `-1`.

The correct approach for `n == 3` would involve:
1. Identifying the missing vertex by finding the point that completes the rectangle.
2. Calculating the area using the coordinates of the four vertices.

Since the program does not correctly handle this case, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
