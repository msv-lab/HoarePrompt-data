Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly address the problem statement based on the provided examples and constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into a list of strings. The first element is converted to an integer `n`, which represents the number of vertices. The subsequent elements are paired to form the vertices' coordinates, which are stored in a list of tuples.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **n = 1 or 3**: In these cases, the program correctly returns `-1` because a single vertex or three vertices do not provide enough information to uniquely determine the area of the rectangle.
   - **n = 2**: The program calculates the area by taking the absolute difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two vertices. This is correct because the two vertices must be opposite corners of the rectangle, and the area can be computed directly from their coordinates.
   - **n = 4**: The program checks if there are exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates. If so, it calculates the area using the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates. This is correct because the four vertices must form a rectangle, and the area can be determined from the unique x and y values.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 or 3 by returning `-1`.
   - For `n = 2`, it correctly computes the area if the vertices are opposite corners.
   - For `n = 4`, it correctly checks for the required unique x and y coordinates and computes the area accordingly.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - The program assumes that the input is valid and follows the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 4, -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000). This assumption is reasonable given the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
