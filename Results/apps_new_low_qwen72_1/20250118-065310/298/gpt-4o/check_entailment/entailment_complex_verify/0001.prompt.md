You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It calculates the area as `area = (n * m) / k` and checks if `area` is an integer. If `area` is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If `area` is an integer but equals zero, it also prints 'NO'. If `area` is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' followed by a series of coordinate pairs. Specifically, it always prints '0 0', '0 1', '1 0', and '0 {m // 2}'. Additionally, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m` and prints an additional coordinate pair accordingly: if `2 * area ≤ n`, it prints '{2 * area} 1'; if `2 * area ≤ m`, it prints '1 {2 * area}'; otherwise, it prints '{n} {m // 2}'. The final state of the program is that `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `area` is either an integer or not, depending on the input values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding three points within a grid defined by dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

1. **Area Calculation and Validation**: 
   - The program correctly calculates the target area as `area = n * m / k`.
   - It checks if the calculated area is an integer using `if area != int(area):`. If not, it prints "NO" and exits, which is correct because non-integer areas cannot be represented by integer coordinate points.
   - It also checks if the area is zero, which would mean no triangle can be formed, and prints "NO" accordingly.

2. **Point Generation**:
   - If the area is valid, the program proceeds to generate the points.
   - It tries to place one point at the origin `(0, 0)` and two other points such that the area condition is satisfied.
   - It attempts to place the second point at `(2 * area, 1)` and the third point at `(0, 1)` if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`. This ensures that the base of the triangle is along the x-axis and the height is 1, making the area calculation straightforward.
   - If the above condition fails, it tries to place the second point at `(1, 2 * area)` and the third point at `(1, 0)` if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. This ensures the base is along the y-axis and the height is 1.
   - If both conditions fail, it places the second point at `(n, m // 2)` and the third point at `(0, m // 2)`, ensuring the area is still valid.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the area is zero or non-integer, and it correctly prints "NO" in such scenarios.
   - It also handles the case where the area is large enough to fit within the grid dimensions, ensuring the points are valid.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all specified conditions and edge cases correctly.
