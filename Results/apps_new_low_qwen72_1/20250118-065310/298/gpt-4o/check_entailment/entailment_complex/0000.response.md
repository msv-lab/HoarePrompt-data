Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding three points that form a triangle with a specific area on a grid defined by the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), and the area is specified as \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The program checks if the required area is an integer and non-zero, which are necessary conditions for the existence of such a triangle.

However, the logic for generating the points has some issues:

1. **Output Format**: The program always prints four coordinate pairs, but the problem specifies that only three points should be printed. The extra print statements will cause the output to be incorrect.
   
2. **Coordinate Calculation**: The logic for determining the coordinates seems flawed. The program attempts to print different sets of coordinates based on whether \(2 \times \text{area}\) is less than or equal to \(n\) or \(m\). However, the way it prints the coordinates does not ensure that the area of the triangle formed by these points is actually equal to the required area. For instance, the program prints `0 0`, `0 1`, `1 0`, and `0 {m // 2}` regardless of the conditions, which does not form a valid triangle with the correct area.

3. **Redundant Print Statements**: There are redundant print statements that will always execute, leading to more than three points being printed, which violates the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
