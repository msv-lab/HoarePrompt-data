### Reasoning:

1. **Area Calculation and Validation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the target area as `area = n * m / k`.
   - It checks if the calculated area is an integer using `if area != int(area):`. If not, it prints "NO" and exits, which is correct because non-integer areas cannot be represented by integer coordinate points.
   - It also checks if the area is zero, which would mean no triangle can be formed, and prints "NO" accordingly.

2. **Point Generation**:
   - If the area is valid, the program proceeds to generate the points.
   - It tries to place one point at the origin `(0, 0)` and two other points such that the area condition is satisfied.
   - It attempts to place the second point at `(2 * area, 1)` and the third point at `(0, 1)` if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`. This ensures that the base of the triangle is along the x-axis and the height is 1, making the area calculation straightforward.
   - If the above condition fails, it tries to place the second point at `(1, 2 * area)` and the third point at `(1, 0)` if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. This ensures the base is along the y-axis and the height is 1.
   - If both conditions fail, it places the second point at `(n, m // 2)` and the third point at `(0, m // 2)`, ensuring the area is still valid.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the area is zero or non-integer, and it correctly prints "NO" in such scenarios.
   - It also handles the case where the area is large enough to fit within the grid dimensions, ensuring the points are valid.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly calculates the area and checks for its validity.
   - The program correctly generates points based on the conditions provided, ensuring that the area of the triangle is equal to the calculated area.
   - The annotations also confirm that the program handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed reasoning and the annotated code analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all specified conditions and edge cases, ensuring that the points generated form a triangle with the required area.

Final: **True**
