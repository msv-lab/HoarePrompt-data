### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Area Calculation**:
   - The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates the area as `area = n * m / k`.
   - It checks if `area` is an integer using `if area != int(area):`. If `area` is not an integer, it prints 'NO' and exits. This part is correct.

2. **Area Validation**:
   - If `area` is an integer, it converts `area` to an integer using `area = int(area)`.
   - It then checks if `area` is zero. If `area` is zero, it prints 'NO' and exits. This part is also correct.

3. **Point Generation**:
   - If `area` is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES'.
   - It always prints the point `(0, 0)`.
   - It then checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`:
     - If true, it prints the points `(2 * area, 1)` and `(0, 1)`.
   - If `2 * area` is not less than or equal to `n`, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`:
     - If true, it prints the points `(1, 2 * area)` and `(1, 0)`.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints the points `(n, m // 2)` and `(0, m // 2)`.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:

- **Correct Handling of Non-Integer Areas**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where the area is not an integer by printing 'NO'.

- **Handling Zero Area**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where the area is zero by printing 'NO'.

- **Point Generation Logic**:
  - The logic for generating points assumes that either `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`. This assumption is not always valid, as demonstrated in the example `(n=5, m=5, k=5)`, where the area is `5` and `2 * area = 10`, which is greater than both `n` and `m`.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1: `(n=4, m=3, k=3)`**
  - The area is `4 * 3 / 3 = 4`, which is an integer.
  - The program prints:
    ```
    YES
    0 0
    8 1
    0 1
    ```
  - This is incorrect because `8 > n`.

- **Example 2: `(n=4, m=4, k=7)`**
  - The area is `4 * 4 / 7 â‰ˆ 2.2857`, which is not an integer.
  - The program correctly prints:
    ```
    NO
    ```

- **Example 3: `(n=5, m=5, k=5)`**
  - The area is `5 * 5 / 5 = 5`, which is an integer.
  - The program prints:
    ```
    YES
    0 0
    10 1
    0 1
    ```
  - This is incorrect because `10 > n`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically when `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
