You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It calculates the area as `area = (n * m) / k` and checks if `area` is an integer. If `area` is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If `area` is an integer but equals zero, it also prints 'NO'. If `area` is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' followed by a series of coordinate pairs. Specifically, it always prints '0 0', '0 1', '1 0', and '0 {m // 2}'. Additionally, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m` and prints an additional coordinate pair accordingly: if `2 * area ≤ n`, it prints '{2 * area} 1'; if `2 * area ≤ m`, it prints '1 {2 * area}'; otherwise, it prints '{n} {m // 2}'. The final state of the program is that `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `area` is either an integer or not, depending on the input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the area is a valid integer but cannot be represented by the given constraints. Specifically, the logic for generating the points assumes that either `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`, which is not always true. For example, consider the input `(n=5, m=5, k=2)`, where the area should be `12.5`, which is not an integer, so the program correctly prints "NO". However, for the input `(n=5, m=5, k=5)`, the area is `5`, which is a valid integer. The program will try to print the points `(0, 0)`, `(10, 1)`, and `(0, 1)`, but this is invalid because `10 > n`. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
