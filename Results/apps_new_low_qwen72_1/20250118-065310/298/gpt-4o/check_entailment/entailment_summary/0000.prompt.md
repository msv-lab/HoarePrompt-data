Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

# Program:
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It calculates the area as `area = (n * m) / k` and checks if `area` is an integer. If `area` is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If `area` is an integer but equals zero, it also prints 'NO'. If `area` is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' followed by a series of coordinate pairs. Specifically, it always prints '0 0', '0 1', '1 0', and '0 {m // 2}'. Additionally, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m` and prints an additional coordinate pair accordingly: if `2 * area ≤ n`, it prints '{2 * area} 1'; if `2 * area ≤ m`, it prints '1 {2 * area}'; otherwise, it prints '{n} {m // 2}'. The final state of the program is that `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `area` is either an integer or not, depending on the input values.
