Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the conditions for determining whether a valid set of points can form a triangle with the specified area. It first checks if the calculated area is an integer and if it is non-zero. If either condition fails, it outputs 'NO'. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'YES' and proceeds to print the coordinates of three points that form a triangle with the required area.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for generating the coordinates:
- The program always prints '0 0' as one of the points.
- For the other two points, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m` and prints the coordinates accordingly. This approach ensures that the base or height of the triangle is an integer, which is necessary for the area calculation to be accurate.
- However, the final condition where it prints `{n} {m // 2}` and `0 {m // 2}` might not always result in a triangle with the correct area, especially when `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m`.

To ensure correctness, we need to verify that the chosen points indeed form a triangle with the correct area. The current logic seems to handle most cases correctly, but the final condition might need a more rigorous check to ensure the area is exactly `area`.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to handle most cases correctly, but the final condition for generating the third point when `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m` might need refinement.

Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct but may fail in some edge cases where `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m`, leading to an incorrect triangle area. A more robust solution would be needed to handle these edge cases accurately.
