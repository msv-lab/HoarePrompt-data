### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle is calculated as \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \). This is done using floating-point division, which is correct for checking if the area is an integer.

3. **Check if Area is an Integer**:
   - The program checks if the area is an integer using `if (area != int(area)):`. If the area is not an integer, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - If the area is an integer, it converts the area to an integer using `area = int(area)`.

4. **Check if Area is Zero**:
   - The program checks if the area is zero using `if (area == 0):`. If the area is zero, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - If the area is not zero, it prints "YES" and proceeds to find the points.

5. **Finding Points**:
   - The program always prints the point `(0, 0)`.
   - It then tries to find two more points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to the calculated area.
   - The logic for finding the points is based on the following conditions:
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it prints the point \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\) and \((0, 1)\).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it prints the point \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\) and \((1, 0)\).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} > m \), it prints the point \((n, m // 2)\) and \((0, m // 2)\).

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Point Calculation**:
  - The logic for calculating the points is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all cases where the area is a valid integer but the points do not form a triangle with the correct area.
  - For example, if \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} > m \), the points \((n, m // 2)\) and \((0, m // 2)\) do not necessarily form a triangle with the correct area.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases for finding valid points that form a triangle with the required area. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
