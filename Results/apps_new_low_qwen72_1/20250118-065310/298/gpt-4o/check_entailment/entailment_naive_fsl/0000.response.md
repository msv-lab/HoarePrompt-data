Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the area is a valid integer but cannot be represented by the given constraints. Specifically, the logic for generating the points assumes that either `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`, which is not always true. For example, consider the input `(n=5, m=5, k=2)`, where the area should be `12.5`, which is not an integer, so the program correctly prints "NO". However, for the input `(n=5, m=5, k=5)`, the area is `5`, which is a valid integer. The program will try to print the points `(0, 0)`, `(10, 1)`, and `(0, 1)`, but this is invalid because `10 > n`. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
