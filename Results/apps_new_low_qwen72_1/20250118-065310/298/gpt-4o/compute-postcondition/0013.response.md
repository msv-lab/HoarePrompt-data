The provided code snippet consists of two print statements. These statements do not modify any variables or change the state of the program; they only output text to the console. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged after the execution of the code.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer from input
- `m` is an integer from input
- `k` is an integer from input
- `area` is `(n * m) // k`
- `area` is not equal to 0
- `2 * area` is greater than `n`
- `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`

The code prints:
1. The string `f'1 {2 * area}'`, which includes the value of `2 * area`.
2. The string `f'1 0'`.

Since no variables are modified by the code, the final state is identical to the initial state.

Output State: **n is an integer from input, m is an integer from input, k is an integer from input, area is (n * m) // k, area is not equal to 0, 2 * area is greater than n, 2 * area is less than or equal to m**
