Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from input, `area` is calculated as `(n * m) // k`, and `area` is not equal to 0. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then this condition holds true. Otherwise, `2 * area` is greater than `n`. In all cases, `2 * area` is either less than or equal to `m` or greater than `m`.***
