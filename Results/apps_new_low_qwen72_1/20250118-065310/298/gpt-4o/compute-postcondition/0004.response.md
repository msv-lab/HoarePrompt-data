The value of `area` is cast to an integer using the `int()` function. This means that `area` will now hold the integer part of the original value of `area`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `area` is `(n * m) // k`**
