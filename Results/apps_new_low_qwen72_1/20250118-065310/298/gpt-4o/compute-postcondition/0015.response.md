The provided code snippet consists of two print statements. These statements do not alter the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. They only print specific expressions involving `n` and `m`.

- The first print statement outputs the value of `n` followed by the result of `m // 2`.
- The second print statement outputs `0` followed by the result of `m // 2`.

Since no variables are modified by these print statements, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **n is an integer from input, m is an integer from input, k is an integer from input, area is (n * m) // k, area is not equal to 0, and 2 * area is greater than n, 2 * area is greater than m**
