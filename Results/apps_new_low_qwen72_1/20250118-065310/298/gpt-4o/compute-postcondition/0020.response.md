The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters, which we can infer as `n`, `m`, and `k`. These parameters are integers within specific ranges: `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`.

Since the output description is not provided, I cannot specify what the function returns. However, typically such a function might perform some operation using `n`, `m`, and `k` and return a result based on these inputs.

For the purpose of this task, I will describe the functionality based on the typical structure:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, all of which are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not described here.**
