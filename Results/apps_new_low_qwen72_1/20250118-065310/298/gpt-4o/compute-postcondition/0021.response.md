Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. It calculates the area as `area = (n * m) / k` and checks if `area` is an integer. If `area` is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If `area` is an integer but equals zero, it also prints 'NO'. If `area` is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' followed by a series of coordinate pairs. Specifically, it always prints '0 0', '0 1', '1 0', and '0 {m // 2}'. Additionally, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m` and prints an additional coordinate pair accordingly: if `2 * area ≤ n`, it prints '{2 * area} 1'; if `2 * area ≤ m`, it prints '1 {2 * area}'; otherwise, it prints '{n} {m // 2}'. The final state of the program is that `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `area` is either an integer or not, depending on the input values. **

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n * m` is not divisible by `k`, the function will print 'NO'.
- If `n * m` is divisible by `k` but the result is zero, the function will print 'NO'.
- If `n * m` is divisible by `k` and the result is a positive integer, the function will proceed to print the specified coordinates.
- The function does not handle the case where `n` or `m` is zero, which might lead to division by zero or incorrect results.
- The function does not handle the case where `k` is 1, which might simplify the calculation but still needs to check if `area` is zero.
