The provided code snippet consists of two print statements. The first statement prints 'YES', and the second statement prints '0 0'. These operations do not modify any of the variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`) that were defined in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer from input, m is an integer from input, k is an integer from input, area is (n * m) // k, and area is not equal to 0**
