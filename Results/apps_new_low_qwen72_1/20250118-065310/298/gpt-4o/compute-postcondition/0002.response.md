The code snippet prints 'NO' and does not modify any of the existing variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `area` is `(n * m) / k`, and the value of `area` is not an integer.**
