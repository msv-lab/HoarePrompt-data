The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input, assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively, and then calculates the area by dividing the product of `n` and `m` by `k`.

Given the initial state where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, the code modifies these variables and introduces a new variable `area` which holds the result of the division.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, and `area` is calculated as `n * m / k`.

Output State: **n is an integer from input, m is an integer from input, k is an integer from input, area is (n * m) / k**
