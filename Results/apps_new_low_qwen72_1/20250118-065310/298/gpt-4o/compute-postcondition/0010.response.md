The provided code snippet consists of two print statements. These statements do not modify any variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `area`) but only output certain values based on the current state. Here's the analysis:

- The first print statement outputs the value of `2 * area` followed by `1`. This does not change any variables.
- The second print statement outputs `0 1`, which also does not change any variables.

Since no variables are modified by the code, the initial state remains unchanged. The only action taken is the printing of two lines of text.

Output State: **n is an integer from input, m is an integer from input, k is an integer from input, area is (n * m) // k, and area is not equal to 0. Additionally, 2 * area is less than or equal to n.**
