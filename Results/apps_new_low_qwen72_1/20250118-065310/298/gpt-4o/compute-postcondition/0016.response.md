Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from input. `area` is calculated as `(n * m) // k`, and `area` is not equal to 0. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `2 * area` is greater than `m`. In both cases, `2 * area` is greater than `n`.***
