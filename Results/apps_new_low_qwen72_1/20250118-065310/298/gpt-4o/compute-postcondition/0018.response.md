Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from input, and `area` is calculated as `(n * m) // k`. If `area` is 0, then `area` remains 0. Otherwise, `area` is not equal to 0, and `2 * area` is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`. Additionally, in all cases, `2 * area` is either less than or equal to `m` or greater than `m`.***
