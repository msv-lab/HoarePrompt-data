The code `deck1.extend([card1, card2])` appends the cards `card1` and `card2` to the end of `deck1`. Given that `card1` is greater than `card2`, these cards are added in this order to `deck1`.

- `deck1` is updated to include `card1` and `card2` at the end.
- `deck2` remains unchanged.
- `seen` remains unchanged.
- `card1` and `card2` retain their values, but they are now also part of `deck1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first card, plus `card1` and `card2` at the end, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first card, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`, `card1` is the first card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the first card of the initial `deck2`, and `card1` is greater than `card2`.**
