The code snippet `deck2.extend([card2, card1])` appends the cards `card2` and `card1` to the end of `deck2`. Let's break down the changes:

- `deck2` now includes the cards `card2` and `card1` at the end of its current list.
- The rest of the variables (`deck1`, `card1`, `card2`, `seen`, `state`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first three cards, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first three cards followed by `[card2, card1]`, `card1` is the third card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the third card of the initial `deck2`, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`, the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`, and the current state `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`, `state` is `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`**
