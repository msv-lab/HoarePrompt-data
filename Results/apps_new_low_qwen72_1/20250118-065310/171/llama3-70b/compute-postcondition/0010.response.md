The code `deck2.extend([card2, card1])` adds both `card2` and `card1` to the end of `deck2`. This operation modifies `deck2` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The new `deck2` will include these two cards appended to its existing state.

Output State: **`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first card, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first card plus `card2` and `card1` at the end, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`, `card1` is the first card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the first card of the initial `deck2`, and `card1` is less than or equal to `card2`**
