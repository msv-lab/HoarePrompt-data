Output State: **The program returns a tuple `(len(seen), 1)` if `deck1` is not empty, otherwise it returns `(len(seen), 2)`. Here, `len(seen)` represents the number of unique states of `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))` encountered during the loop's execution, and the second element of the tuple is 1 if `deck1` is not empty, indicating `deck2` is empty, or 2 if `deck1` is empty, indicating `deck2` is not empty.**
