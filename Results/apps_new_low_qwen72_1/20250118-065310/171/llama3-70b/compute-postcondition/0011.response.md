Postcondition: ***`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first card, and `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first card. `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`. If `card1` > `card2`, `deck1` is updated to include `card1` and `card2` at the end, while `deck2` remains unchanged. If `card1` â‰¤ `card2`, `deck2` is updated to include `card2` and `card1` at the end, while `deck1` remains unchanged. `card1` and `card2` retain their values.***
