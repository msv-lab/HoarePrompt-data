You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state in the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer**

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1
```
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: *`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards, if `card1` > `card2`, `deck1` is extended with `card1` and `card2`, and `deck2` remains the initial `deck2` minus the first two cards; otherwise, `deck2` is extended with `card2` and `card1`, and `deck1` remains the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards. `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))` and the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`. `card1` is the second card of the initial `deck1`, and `card2` is the second card of the initial `deck2`. `state` is `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`. If `state` is in `seen`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated `deck1` and `deck2`.
```
seen.add(state)
card1 = deck1.pop(0)
card2 = deck2.pop(0)

```

Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the results. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
```
