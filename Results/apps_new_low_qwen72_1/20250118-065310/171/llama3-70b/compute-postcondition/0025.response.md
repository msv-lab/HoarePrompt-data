The code `deck1.extend([card1, card2])` appends `card1` and `card2` to the end of `deck1`. This changes the composition of `deck1` but does not affect the other variables. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first three cards plus `card1` and `card2`, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first three cards, `card1` is the third card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the third card of the initial `deck2`, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`, the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`, and the current state `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`, `state` is `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`.

Output State: **`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first three cards plus `card1` and `card2`, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first three cards, `card1` is the third card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the third card of the initial `deck2`, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`, the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`, and the current state `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`, `state` is `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`.**
