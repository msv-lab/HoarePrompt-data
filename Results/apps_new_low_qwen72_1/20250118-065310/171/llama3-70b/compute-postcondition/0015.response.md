Postcondition: ***`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first card, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first card, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`, `card1` and `card2` retain their values, `state` is `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`. If `state` is in `seen`, the program returns -1.***
