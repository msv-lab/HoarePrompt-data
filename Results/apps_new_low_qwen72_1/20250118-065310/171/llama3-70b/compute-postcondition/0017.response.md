The code `deck1.extend([card1, card2])` adds the cards `card1` and `card2` to the end of `deck1`. Let's break down the changes:

- `deck1` was initially described as the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards. After executing the code, `deck1` now includes the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards, followed by `card1` and `card2`.
- `deck2` remains unchanged as the code only affects `deck1`.
- `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))` and the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`. This remains unchanged.
- `card1` and `card2` remain the same as they were defined as the second cards of the initial `deck1` and `deck2`, respectively.
- `state` is `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))` and remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards followed by `card1` and `card2`, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first two cards, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))` and the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`, `card1` is the second card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the second card of the initial `deck2`, `state` is `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`**.
