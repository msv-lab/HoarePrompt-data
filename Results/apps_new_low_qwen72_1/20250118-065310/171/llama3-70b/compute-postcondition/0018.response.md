The code `deck2.extend([card2, card1])` appends the cards `card2` and `card1` to the end of `deck2`. 

- `deck1` remains the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards.
- `deck2` is updated to include the cards `card2` and `card1` appended to the end of the initial `deck2` minus the first two cards.
- `seen` still contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))` and the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`.
- `card1` is the second card of the initial `deck1`.
- `card2` is the second card of the initial `deck2`.
- `state` is `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`.

Output State: **`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first two cards with `card2` and `card1` appended, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))` and the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`, `card1` is the second card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the second card of the initial `deck2`, `state` is `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`**
