Postcondition: ***`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first three cards, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first three cards, `card1` is the third card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the third card of the initial `deck2`, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`, the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`, and the current state `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`, `state` is `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`. If `card1` > `card2`, `deck1` is appended with `card1` and `card2`. Otherwise, `deck2` is appended with `card2` and `card1`.***
