The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `deck1` and `deck2`. Both `deck1` and `deck2` are lists of integers, representing the stacks of cards for two players. The integers in `deck1` and `deck2` are unique and range from 1 to the sum of the lengths of `deck1` and `deck2`, inclusive. The lengths of `deck1` and `deck2` are at least 1, and their sum is between 2 and 10, inclusive.

The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The program returns `-1`.
- **Case_2**: The program returns `-1`.
- **Case_3**: The program returns `-1`.
- **Case_4**: The program returns a tuple `(len(seen), 1)` if `deck1` is not empty, otherwise it returns `(len(seen), 2)`. Here, `len(seen)` represents the number of unique states of `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))` encountered during the loop's execution, and the second element of the tuple is 1 if `deck1` is not empty (indicating `deck2` is empty), or 2 if `deck1` is empty (indicating `deck2` is not empty).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `deck1` and `deck2`, which are lists of integers representing the stacks of cards for two players. It returns `-1` in three specific cases. In another case, it returns a tuple `(len(seen), 1)` if `deck1` is not empty, otherwise it returns `(len(seen), 2)`, where `len(seen)` is the number of unique states of `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))` encountered.**
