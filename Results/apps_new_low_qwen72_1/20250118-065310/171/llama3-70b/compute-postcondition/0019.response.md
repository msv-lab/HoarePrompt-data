Postcondition: ***`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards. If `card1` > `card2`, `deck1` is extended with `card1` and `card2`, and `deck2` remains the initial `deck2` minus the first two cards. Otherwise, `deck2` is extended with `card2` and `card1`, and `deck1` remains the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards. `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))` and the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`. `card1` is the second card of the initial `deck1`, and `card2` is the second card of the initial `deck2`. `state` is `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`.***
