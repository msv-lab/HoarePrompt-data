Functionality: ** The function `func_1` simulates a game between two players using decks of cards represented by `deck1` and `deck2`. The function ensures that the game does not enter an infinite loop by tracking previously seen states. If a cycle is detected, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, the function continues until one of the decks is empty. At the end of the game, the function returns a tuple `(len(seen), winner)`, where `len(seen)` is the number of unique states encountered during the game, and `winner` is 1 if `deck1` is not empty (indicating `deck2` is empty) or 2 if `deck1` is empty (indicating `deck2` is not empty). The function handles edge cases such as initial decks being empty or containing only one card, ensuring the game progresses correctly until a winner is determined or a cycle is detected. **
