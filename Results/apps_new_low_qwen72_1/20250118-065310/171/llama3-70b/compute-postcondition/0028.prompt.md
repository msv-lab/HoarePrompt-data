Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: deck1 and deck2 are lists of integers, representing the stacks of cards for the two players. The integers in deck1 and deck2 are unique and range from 1 to the sum of the lengths of deck1 and deck2, inclusive. The lengths of deck1 and deck2 are at least 1 and their sum is between 2 and 10, inclusive. `seen` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while deck1 and deck2:
    state = tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2)
    if state in seen:
        return -1
    seen.add(state)
    card1 = deck1.pop(0)
    card2 = deck2.pop(0)
    if card1 > card2:
        deck1.extend([card1, card2])
    else:
        deck2.extend([card2, card1])


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first card, and `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first card. `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`. If `card1` > `card2`, `deck1` is updated to include `card1` and `card2` at the end, while `deck2` remains unchanged. If `card1` â‰¤ `card2`, `deck2` is updated to include `card2` and `card1` at the end, while `deck1` remains unchanged. `card1` and `card2` retain their values.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards. If `card1` > `card2`, `deck1` is extended with `card1` and `card2`, and `deck2` remains the initial `deck2` minus the first two cards. Otherwise, `deck2` is extended with `card2` and `card1`, and `deck1` remains the initial `deck1` minus the first two cards. `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))` and the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`. `card1` is the second card of the initial `deck1`, and `card2` is the second card of the initial `deck2`. `state` is `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`deck1` is the initial `deck1` minus the first three cards, `deck2` is the initial `deck2` minus the first three cards, `card1` is the third card of the initial `deck1`, `card2` is the third card of the initial `deck2`, `seen` contains the initial state `(tuple(initial_deck1), tuple(initial_deck2))`, the new state `(tuple(new_deck1), tuple(new_deck2))`, and the current state `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`, `state` is `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`. If `card1` > `card2`, `deck1` is appended with `card1` and `card2`. Otherwise, `deck2` is appended with `card2` and `card1`.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
