#State of the program right berfore the function call: deck1 and deck2 are lists of integers, representing the stacks of cards for the two players. The integers in deck1 and deck2 are unique and range from 1 to the sum of the lengths of deck1 and deck2, inclusive. The lengths of deck1 and deck2 are at least 1 and their sum is between 2 and 10, inclusive.
def func_1(deck1, deck2):
    seen = set()
    while deck1 and deck2:
        state = tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2)
        
        if state in seen:
            return -1
        
        seen.add(state)
        
        card1 = deck1.pop(0)
        
        card2 = deck2.pop(0)
        
        if card1 > card2:
            deck1.extend([card1, card2])
        else:
            deck2.extend([card2, card1])
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop finishes, one of the decks (`deck1` or `deck2`) will be empty, and the other deck will contain all the cards in some order. The `seen` set will contain all the unique states of `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))` encountered during the loop's execution. The `state` variable will be the final state `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))`. If the loop returns `-1`, it indicates a cycle was detected before one of the decks became empty.
    return (len(seen), 1) if deck1 else (len(seen), 2)
    #The program returns a tuple `(len(seen), 1)` if `deck1` is not empty, otherwise it returns `(len(seen), 2)`. Here, `len(seen)` represents the number of unique states of `(tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))` encountered during the loop's execution, and the second element of the tuple is 1 if `deck1` is not empty, indicating `deck2` is empty, or 2 if `deck1` is empty, indicating `deck2` is not empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` simulates a game between two players using decks of cards represented by `deck1` and `deck2`. The function ensures that the game does not enter an infinite loop by tracking previously seen states. If a cycle is detected, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, the function continues until one of the decks is empty. At the end of the game, the function returns a tuple `(len(seen), winner)`, where `len(seen)` is the number of unique states encountered during the game, and `winner` is 1 if `deck1` is not empty (indicating `deck2` is empty) or 2 if `deck1` is empty (indicating `deck2` is not empty). The function handles edge cases such as initial decks being empty or containing only one card, ensuring the game progresses correctly until a winner is determined or a cycle is detected.
