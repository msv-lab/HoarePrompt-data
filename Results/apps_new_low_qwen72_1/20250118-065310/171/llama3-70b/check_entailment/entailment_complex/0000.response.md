Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values and initializes the decks for both players. It ensures that the total number of cards matches `n` and that all card values are unique and within the specified range.

2. **Game Simulation**: The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game by:
   - Checking for cycles using a set `seen` to store the states of the decks.
   - Popping the top card from each deck and comparing their values.
   - Appending the cards to the winning player's deck in the correct order.

3. **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly detects cycles by storing the current state of the decks in the `seen` set. If a state is encountered again, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the game will continue indefinitely.

4. **Winning Condition**: The function correctly identifies the winner by checking which deck is empty after the loop ends. It returns the number of unique states encountered (`len(seen)`) and the winner (1 or 2).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when one player starts with only one card or when the decks are initially empty (though the problem guarantees at least one card per player).

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
