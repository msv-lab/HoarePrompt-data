Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Two bored soldiers are playing card war. Their card deck consists of exactly n cards, numbered from 1 to n, all values are different. They divide cards between them in some manner, it's possible that they have different number of cards. Then they play a "war"-like card game. 

The rules are following. On each turn a fight happens. Each of them picks card from the top of his stack and puts on the table. The one whose card value is bigger wins this fight and takes both cards from the table to the bottom of his stack. More precisely, he first takes his opponent's card and puts to the bottom of his stack, and then he puts his card to the bottom of his stack. If after some turn one of the player's stack becomes empty, he loses and the other one wins. 

You have to calculate how many fights will happen and who will win the game, or state that game won't end.


-----Input-----

First line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10), the number of cards.

Second line contains integer k_1 (1 ≤ k_1 ≤ n - 1), the number of the first soldier's cards. Then follow k_1 integers that are the values on the first soldier's cards, from top to bottom of his stack.

Third line contains integer k_2 (k_1 + k_2 = n), the number of the second soldier's cards. Then follow k_2 integers that are the values on the second soldier's cards, from top to bottom of his stack.

All card values are different.


-----Output-----

If somebody wins in this game, print 2 integers where the first one stands for the number of fights before end of game and the second one is 1 or 2 showing which player has won.

If the game won't end and will continue forever output  - 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
2 1 3
2 4 2

Output
6 2
Input
3
1 2
2 1 3

Output
-1

# Program:
n = int(input())
k1 = int(input())
deck1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
k2 = int(input())
deck2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(*func_1(deck1, deck2))

def func_1(deck1, deck2):
    seen = set()
    while deck1 and deck2:
        state = (tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))
        if state in seen:
            return -1
        seen.add(state)
        card1 = deck1.pop(0)
        card2 = deck2.pop(0)
        if card1 > card2:
            deck1.extend([card1, card2])
        else:
            deck2.extend([card2, card1])
    return (len(seen), 1) if deck1 else (len(seen), 2)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` simulates a game between two players using decks of cards represented by `deck1` and `deck2`. The function ensures that the game does not enter an infinite loop by tracking previously seen states. If a cycle is detected, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, the function continues until one of the decks is empty. At the end of the game, the function returns a tuple `(len(seen), winner)`, where `len(seen)` is the number of unique states encountered during the game, and `winner` is 1 if `deck1` is not empty (indicating `deck2` is empty) or 2 if `deck1` is empty (indicating `deck2` is not empty). The function handles edge cases such as initial decks being empty or containing only one card, ensuring the game progresses correctly until a winner is determined or a cycle is detected.
