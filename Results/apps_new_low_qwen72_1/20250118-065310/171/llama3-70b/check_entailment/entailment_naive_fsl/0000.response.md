Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the game continues indefinitely correctly. Specifically, the return value for an infinite loop should be `-1`, but the current implementation returns `(len(seen), 1)` or `(len(seen), 2)` which is incorrect according to the problem description. This means that if the game enters a loop, the function should return `-1` to indicate that the game will not end, but instead it returns the number of unique states seen and the player who would have won if the game had ended, which is not what the problem description specifies.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 2
2 1 3
```
The game will enter a loop, and the correct output should be `-1`. However, the current implementation will return a different result, indicating that the program is incorrect.
