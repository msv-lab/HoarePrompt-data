You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two bored soldiers are playing card war. Their card deck consists of exactly n cards, numbered from 1 to n, all values are different. They divide cards between them in some manner, it's possible that they have different number of cards. Then they play a "war"-like card game. 

The rules are following. On each turn a fight happens. Each of them picks card from the top of his stack and puts on the table. The one whose card value is bigger wins this fight and takes both cards from the table to the bottom of his stack. More precisely, he first takes his opponent's card and puts to the bottom of his stack, and then he puts his card to the bottom of his stack. If after some turn one of the player's stack becomes empty, he loses and the other one wins. 

You have to calculate how many fights will happen and who will win the game, or state that game won't end.


-----Input-----

First line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10), the number of cards.

Second line contains integer k_1 (1 ≤ k_1 ≤ n - 1), the number of the first soldier's cards. Then follow k_1 integers that are the values on the first soldier's cards, from top to bottom of his stack.

Third line contains integer k_2 (k_1 + k_2 = n), the number of the second soldier's cards. Then follow k_2 integers that are the values on the second soldier's cards, from top to bottom of his stack.

All card values are different.


-----Output-----

If somebody wins in this game, print 2 integers where the first one stands for the number of fights before end of game and the second one is 1 or 2 showing which player has won.

If the game won't end and will continue forever output  - 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
2 1 3
2 4 2

Output
6 2
Input
3
1 2
2 1 3

Output
-1


-----Note-----

First sample:  [Image] 

Second sample:  [Image]
Program:
```
n = int(input())
k1 = int(input())
deck1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
k2 = int(input())
deck2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(*func_1(deck1, deck2))

def func_1(deck1, deck2):
    seen = set()
    while deck1 and deck2:
        state = (tuple(deck1), tuple(deck2))
        if state in seen:
            return -1
        seen.add(state)
        card1 = deck1.pop(0)
        card2 = deck2.pop(0)
        if card1 > card2:
            deck1.extend([card1, card2])
        else:
            deck2.extend([card2, card1])
    return (len(seen), 1) if deck1 else (len(seen), 2)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
