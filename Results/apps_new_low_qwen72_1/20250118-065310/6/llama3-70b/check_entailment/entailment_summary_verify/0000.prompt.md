You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. It calculates a value `ans` based on the following rules:
- If `pos` is less than `l`, `ans` is increased by `l - pos`.
- If `pos` is greater than `r`, `ans` is increased by `pos - r`.
- `ans` is further increased by `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.

The final value of `ans` is printed. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `ans` represents the calculated result based on the input parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r]. Specifically, the issue lies in the calculation of `ans`:

```python
ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
```

This line attempts to account for the number of seconds needed to close all tabs to the left and right of the current position. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the cursor is already within the segment [l, r].

Consider the following example:
- Input: `6 3 1 3`
- Expected Output: `1`

The program outputs `2` instead of `1`. This is because the program incorrectly adds the time to close all tabs to the left of the current position (`max(0, l - 1)`) even though the cursor is already within the segment [l, r].

To fix this, the program should only add the time to close tabs to the left or right if the cursor is outside the segment [l, r]. A corrected version of the program would look like this:

```python
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
        ans += max(0, l - 1)  # Close all tabs to the left of l
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
        ans += n - r  # Close all tabs to the right of r
    if l <= pos <= r:
        ans += max(l - 1, 0) + max(n - r, 0)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for every potential input.
