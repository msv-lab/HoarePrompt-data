You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, pos, l, r are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())

ans = 0
    if (pos < l) :
        ans += l - pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `pos` ≤ `n`, 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`. If `pos` < `l`, `ans` is set to `l - pos`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    if (pos > r) :
        ans += pos - r
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `pos` ≤ `n`, 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`. If `pos` < `l`, `ans` is set to `l - pos`. If `pos` > `r`, `ans` is set to `pos - r`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. The approach taken by the function `func()` is to calculate the total number of operations required based on the initial position of the cursor and the target segment `[l, r]`.

1. **Initial Position Adjustments**:
   - If the cursor is to the left of `l`, the program adds the distance from `pos` to `l` to the answer (`ans += l - pos`). This accounts for moving the cursor to the start of the segment.
   - If the cursor is to the right of `r`, the program adds the distance from `pos` to `r` to the answer (`ans += pos - r`). This accounts for moving the cursor to the end of the segment.

2. **Closing Tabs**:
   - The program then calculates the minimum number of operations needed to close all tabs to the left of the cursor (`min(pos - 1, n - r)`) and to the right of the cursor (`max(0, l - 1)`). 
     - `min(pos - 1, n - r)` ensures that if the cursor is already within the segment `[l, r]`, the operation to close tabs to the left is minimized.
     - `max(0, l - 1)` ensures that if `l` is 1, no tabs need to be closed to the left, and if `l` is greater than 1, the operation to close tabs to the left is counted.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final answer is printed, which is the sum of the distances moved and the operations to close the tabs.

However, there is a logical issue in the calculation of the closing operations. Specifically, the term `min(pos - 1, n - r)` is not correctly accounting for the number of tabs to close to the left. Instead, it should be `max(0, l - 1)` for the left side and `max(0, n - r)` for the right side.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += max(0, l - 1) + max(0, n - r)
    print(ans)
```

Given the original program, the correctness is **False** because the logic for calculating the number of operations to close the tabs is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
