Functionality: ** The function `func` reads four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. It calculates a value `ans` based on the following rules:
- If `pos` is less than `l`, `ans` is increased by `l - pos`.
- If `pos` is greater than `r`, `ans` is increased by `pos - r`.
- `ans` is further increased by `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.

The final value of `ans` is printed. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `ans` represents the calculated result based on the input parameters. **

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that the input will always be valid (i.e., integers within the specified ranges). If invalid input is provided, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to `map(int, input().split())`.
- The function does not handle cases where `pos` is equal to `l` or `r` separately, but this is covered by the logic since `ans` would remain unchanged in those scenarios.
- The function does not have any explicit error handling for input validation or edge cases, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input constraints are not met.
