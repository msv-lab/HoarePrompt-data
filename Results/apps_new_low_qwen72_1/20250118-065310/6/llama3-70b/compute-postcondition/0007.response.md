The provided code snippet modifies the value of `ans` based on the conditions involving `pos`, `l`, and `r`. Let's analyze the entire block of code to determine the final state:

1. The first part of the code, `ans += min(pos - 1, n - r)`, adds the minimum value between `pos - 1` and `n - r` to `ans`.
2. The second part, `ans += max(0, l - 1)`, adds the maximum value between 0 and `l - 1` to `ans`.
3. Finally, the value of `ans` is printed.

Let's break down the logic and compute the final value of `ans`:

- **Initial Condition**: 
  - `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `pos` ≤ `n`, 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`.
  - If `pos` < `l`, `ans` is set to `l - pos`.
  - If `pos` > `r`, `ans` is set to `pos - r`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

- **First Line**: `ans += min(pos - 1, n - r)`
  - `min(pos - 1, n - r)` calculates the minimum value between `pos - 1` and `n - r`.
  - This value is added to `ans`.

- **Second Line**: `ans += max(0, l - 1)`
  - `max(0, l - 1)` calculates the maximum value between 0 and `l - 1`.
  - This value is added to `ans`.

Combining these steps, we get the final value of `ans`:

1. If `pos` < `l`, `ans` starts as `l - pos`.
2. If `pos` > `r`, `ans` starts as `pos - r`.
3. Otherwise, `ans` starts as 0.

Then, `ans` is updated by adding `min(pos - 1, n - r)` and `max(0, l - 1)`.

Let's summarize the final state:

- If `pos` < `l`, `ans` becomes `(l - pos) + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.
- If `pos` > `r`, `ans` becomes `(pos - r) + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.
- Otherwise, `ans` becomes `0 + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer between 1 and n, l is an integer between 1 and n, r is an integer between l and n, ans is (l - pos) + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1) if pos < l, ans is (pos - r) + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1) if pos > r, ans is min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1) otherwise**.
