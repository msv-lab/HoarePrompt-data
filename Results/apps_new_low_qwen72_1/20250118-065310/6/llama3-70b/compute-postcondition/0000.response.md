The provided code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. It then initializes a variable `ans` to 0. Since the initial state already specifies the constraints for `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, these variables retain their specified properties after the assignment. The variable `ans` is set to 0, which is a new addition to the state.

Output State: **n, pos, l, r are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, ans is 0**
