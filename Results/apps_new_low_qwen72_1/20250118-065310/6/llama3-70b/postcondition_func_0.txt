The function `func` reads four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. It calculates a value `ans` based on the following rules:
- If `pos` is less than `l`, `ans` is increased by `l - pos`.
- If `pos` is greater than `r`, `ans` is increased by `pos - r`.
- `ans` is further increased by `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.

The final value of `ans` is printed. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `ans` represents the calculated result based on the input parameters.
