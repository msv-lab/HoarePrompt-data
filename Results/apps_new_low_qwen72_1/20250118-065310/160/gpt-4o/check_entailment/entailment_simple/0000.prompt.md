Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array of n elements, you must make it a co-prime array in as few moves as possible.

In each move you can insert any positive integral number you want not greater than 10^9 in any place in the array.

An array is co-prime if any two adjacent numbers of it are co-prime.

In the number theory, two integers a and b are said to be co-prime if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of elements in the given array.

The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.


-----Output-----

Print integer k on the first line — the least number of elements needed to add to the array a to make it co-prime.

The second line should contain n + k integers a_{j} — the elements of the array a after adding k elements to it. Note that the new array should be co-prime, so any two adjacent values should be co-prime. Also the new array should be got from the original array a by adding k elements to it.

If there are multiple answers you can print any one of them.


-----Example-----
Input
3
2 7 28

Output
1
2 7 9 28

# Annotated Program:
import math

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = [a[0]]
count = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    if not func_1(result[-1], a[i]):
        result.append(1)
        count += 1
    result.append(a[i])
print(count)
print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(a) ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9, b is an integer representing the number of elements in the array a, where 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000.
def func_1(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `b` and the first element of the list `a` is 1. Note: The `math.gcd` function is applied between `b` and the first element of `a` since `a` is a list and `math.gcd` expects two integers.
