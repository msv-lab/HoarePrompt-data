Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an array of n elements, you must make it a co-prime array in as few moves as possible.

In each move you can insert any positive integral number you want not greater than 10^9 in any place in the array.

An array is co-prime if any two adjacent numbers of it are co-prime.

In the number theory, two integers a and b are said to be co-prime if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of elements in the given array.

The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.


-----Output-----

Print integer k on the first line — the least number of elements needed to add to the array a to make it co-prime.

The second line should contain n + k integers a_{j} — the elements of the array a after adding k elements to it. Note that the new array should be co-prime, so any two adjacent values should be co-prime. Also the new array should be got from the original array a by adding k elements to it.

If there are multiple answers you can print any one of them.


-----Example-----
Input
3
2 7 28

Output
1
2 7 9 28

# Program:
import math

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = [a[0]]
count = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    if not func_1(result[-1], a[i]):
        result.append(1)
        count += 1
    result.append(a[i])
print(count)
print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `b`. It returns `True` if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `b` and the first element of `a` is 1; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function only considers the first element of the list `a` and does not use the rest of the elements. If the list `a` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first element of an empty list. Additionally, if `b` is 0, the function will return `False` since the GCD of any non-zero number and 0 is the non-zero number itself, which is not 1.
