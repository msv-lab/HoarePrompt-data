Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the initial element of the array is not co-prime with the inserted value of 1. For instance, consider the input:

```
2
6 9
```

The expected output should be:
```
1
6 7 9
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
6 1 9
```

In this output, `6` and `1` are co-prime, but `1` and `9` are not co-prime, violating the requirement that any two adjacent numbers in the resulting array must be co-prime. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
