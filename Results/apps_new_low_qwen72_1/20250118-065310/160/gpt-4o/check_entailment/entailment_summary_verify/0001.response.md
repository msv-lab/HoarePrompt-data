Reasoning:
The original assessment is mostly accurate but overlooks a crucial detail in the function summary provided. The function summary for `func_1` incorrectly describes the parameters and the behavior of the function. Specifically, `func_1` does not accept a list and an integer; it accepts two integers and returns `True` if their GCD is 1, indicating they are co-prime. This misunderstanding could lead to confusion, but the actual implementation of `func_1` in the program is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

The program correctly:
1. Reads the input.
2. Uses `func_1` to check if adjacent elements are co-prime.
3. Inserts the number 1 between non-co-prime elements.
4. Counts the number of insertions.
5. Prints the count of insertions and the modified array.

The only issue mentioned in the original assessment is the output formatting, which is indeed a minor issue. However, the provided fix (`print(' '.join(map(str, result)))`) is already implemented in the given program, so the program actually formats the output correctly.

Therefore, the program is logically correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
