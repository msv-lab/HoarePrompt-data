The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `b`. It returns `True` if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `b` and the first element of `a` is 1; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function only considers the first element of the list `a` and does not use the rest of the elements. If the list `a` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first element of an empty list. Additionally, if `b` is 0, the function will return `False` since the GCD of any non-zero number and 0 is the non-zero number itself, which is not 1.
