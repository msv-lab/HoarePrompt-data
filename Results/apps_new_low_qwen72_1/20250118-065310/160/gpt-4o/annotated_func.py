#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(a) ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9, b is an integer representing the number of elements in the array a, where 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000.
def func_1(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `b` and the first element of the list `a` is 1. Note: The `math.gcd` function is applied between `b` and the first element of `a` since `a` is a list and `math.gcd` expects two integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `b`. It returns `True` if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `b` and the first element of `a` is 1; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function only considers the first element of the list `a` and does not use the rest of the elements. If the list `a` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first element of an empty list. Additionally, if `b` is 0, the function will return `False` since the GCD of any non-zero number and 0 is the non-zero number itself, which is not 1.
