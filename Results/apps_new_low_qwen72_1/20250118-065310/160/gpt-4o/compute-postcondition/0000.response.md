Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `b` and the first element of the list `a` is 1. Note: The `math.gcd` function is applied between `b` and the first element of `a` since `a` is a list and `math.gcd` expects two integers.**
