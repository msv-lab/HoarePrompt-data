The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 1000, and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and 10^9. `b` is an integer between 1 and 1000. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer `b` and the first element of the list `a` is 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `b`. It returns `True` if the GCD of `b` and the first element of `a` is 1; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
