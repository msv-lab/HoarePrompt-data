Reasoning:  
The program needs to determine if it is possible to add `n - m` temperatures to the existing `m` temperatures such that the minimum temperature is `min_temp` and the maximum temperature is `max_temp`. The logic in the program checks the following:

1. **Presence of Min and Max Temperatures**: The program checks if `min_temp` and `max_temp` are already in the list of `m` temperatures.
2. **Additional Temperatures Needed**: The program calculates how many additional temperatures (`n - m`) are needed to reach the total of `n` temperatures.
3. **Conditions for Correctness**:
   - If both `min_temp` and `max_temp` are already in the list, the program prints 'Correct'.
   - If only one of `min_temp` or `max_temp` is in the list, and there is at least one additional temperature that can be added (`n - m >= 1`), the program prints 'Correct'.
   - If neither `min_temp` nor `max_temp` is in the list, the program checks if there are at least two additional temperatures that can be added (`n - m >= 2`). If so, it prints 'Correct'.

These conditions ensure that it is possible to achieve the required minimum and maximum temperatures by adding the necessary number of temperatures.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
