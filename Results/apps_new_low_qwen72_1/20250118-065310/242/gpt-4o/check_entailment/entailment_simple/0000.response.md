Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `min_temp`, and `max_temp`, and then reads the list of `m` temperatures.

2. **Checking Minimum and Maximum Temperatures**: The program checks if the `min_temp` and `max_temp` are present in the list of `m` temperatures using the variables `contains_min` and `contains_max`.

3. **Additional Temperatures Needed**: The program calculates the number of additional temperatures needed (`additional_needed = n - m`).

4. **Conditions for Correctness**:
   - If both `min_temp` and `max_temp` are already in the list (`contains_min` and `contains_max` are `True`), the program prints 'Correct'.
   - If either `min_temp` or `max_temp` is missing from the list, the program checks if it is possible to add the necessary temperatures:
     - If `additional_needed` is 2 or more, it is always possible to add the missing `min_temp` and/or `max_temp`.
     - If `additional_needed` is 1, it is only possible if at least one of `min_temp` or `max_temp` is already in the list.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, the program prints 'Incorrect'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `n` and `m` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ m < n ≤ 100).
   - The program correctly handles cases where `min_temp` and `max_temp` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100).
   - The program ensures that the temperatures in the list are within the range (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100).

6. **Consistency with Examples**:
   - For the first example, the program correctly identifies that adding one temperature to [1] to get a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2 is possible.
   - For the second example, the program correctly identifies that adding two temperatures to [2] to get a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 is possible.
   - For the third example, the program correctly identifies that adding one temperature to [2] to get a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 is not possible.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be logically correct and handles all edge cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
