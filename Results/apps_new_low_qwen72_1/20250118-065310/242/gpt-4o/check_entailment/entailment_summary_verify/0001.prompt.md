You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Not so long ago company R2 bought company R1 and consequently, all its developments in the field of multicore processors. Now the R2 laboratory is testing one of the R1 processors.

The testing goes in n steps, at each step the processor gets some instructions, and then its temperature is measured. The head engineer in R2 is keeping a report record on the work of the processor: he writes down the minimum and the maximum measured temperature in his notebook. His assistant had to write down all temperatures into his notebook, but (for unknown reasons) he recorded only m.

The next day, the engineer's assistant filed in a report with all the m temperatures. However, the chief engineer doubts that the assistant wrote down everything correctly (naturally, the chief engineer doesn't doubt his notes). So he asked you to help him. Given numbers n, m, min, max and the list of m temperatures determine whether you can upgrade the set of m temperatures to the set of n temperatures (that is add n - m temperatures), so that the minimum temperature was min and the maximum one was max.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers n, m, min, max (1 ≤ m < n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ min < max ≤ 100). The second line contains m space-separated integers t_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 100) — the temperatures reported by the assistant.

Note, that the reported temperatures, and the temperatures you want to add can contain equal temperatures.


-----Output-----

If the data is consistent, print 'Correct' (without the quotes). Otherwise, print 'Incorrect' (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1 1 2
1

Output
Correct

Input
3 1 1 3
2

Output
Correct

Input
2 1 1 3
2

Output
Incorrect



-----Note-----

In the first test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [1, 2].

In the second test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [2, 1, 3].

In the third test sample it is impossible to add one temperature to obtain the minimum equal to 1 and the maximum equal to 3.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m, min_temp, max_temp) = map(int, input().split())
    temperatures = list(map(int, input().split()))
    contains_min = min_temp in temperatures
    contains_max = max_temp in temperatures
    additional_needed = n - m
    if contains_min and contains_max:
        print('Correct')
    elif additional_needed >= 2 or (additional_needed == 1 and (contains_min or contains_max)):
        print('Correct')
    else:
        print('Incorrect')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `min_temp`, `max_temp`, and a list of `m` temperatures. It checks if the `min_temp` and `max_temp` are present in the `temperatures` list. Based on whether these temperatures are present and the number of additional temperatures needed (`n - m`), it prints 'Correct' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'Incorrect'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result based on the conditions. The final state of the program includes the original inputs and the printed output, which indicates whether the conditions for `min_temp` and `max_temp` being present or the possibility of adding them are satisfied.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to add \( n - m \) temperatures to the existing list of \( m \) temperatures such that the final list has a minimum temperature of `min_temp` and a maximum temperature of `max_temp`.

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the current list of temperatures already contains both `min_temp` and `max_temp`, the configuration is correct.
   - If the current list contains either `min_temp` or `max_temp` and there are enough additional temperatures to be added (at least 2 more temperatures or exactly 1 more temperature if one of the required temperatures is already present), the configuration can still be correct.

2. **Conditions for Correctness**:
   - **Both `min_temp` and `max_temp` are in the list**: This means the current list already meets the required conditions.
   - **One of `min_temp` or `max_temp` is in the list and there are at least 2 more temperatures to be added**: This allows us to add the missing temperature and another arbitrary temperature to meet the conditions.
   - **One of `min_temp` or `max_temp` is in the list and there is exactly 1 more temperature to be added**: This allows us to add the missing temperature directly.

3. **Conditions for Incorrectness**:
   - If neither `min_temp` nor `max_temp` is in the list and there are fewer than 2 more temperatures to be added, it's impossible to meet the required conditions.

Given the logic in the provided program:
- It checks if both `min_temp` and `max_temp` are in the list.
- It checks if one of them is in the list and there are enough additional temperatures to add the missing one.

This logic correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
