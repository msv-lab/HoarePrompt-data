You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Not so long ago company R2 bought company R1 and consequently, all its developments in the field of multicore processors. Now the R2 laboratory is testing one of the R1 processors.

The testing goes in n steps, at each step the processor gets some instructions, and then its temperature is measured. The head engineer in R2 is keeping a report record on the work of the processor: he writes down the minimum and the maximum measured temperature in his notebook. His assistant had to write down all temperatures into his notebook, but (for unknown reasons) he recorded only m.

The next day, the engineer's assistant filed in a report with all the m temperatures. However, the chief engineer doubts that the assistant wrote down everything correctly (naturally, the chief engineer doesn't doubt his notes). So he asked you to help him. Given numbers n, m, min, max and the list of m temperatures determine whether you can upgrade the set of m temperatures to the set of n temperatures (that is add n - m temperatures), so that the minimum temperature was min and the maximum one was max.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers n, m, min, max (1 ≤ m < n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ min < max ≤ 100). The second line contains m space-separated integers t_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 100) — the temperatures reported by the assistant.

Note, that the reported temperatures, and the temperatures you want to add can contain equal temperatures.


-----Output-----

If the data is consistent, print 'Correct' (without the quotes). Otherwise, print 'Incorrect' (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1 1 2
1

Output
Correct

Input
3 1 1 3
2

Output
Correct

Input
2 1 1 3
2

Output
Incorrect



-----Note-----

In the first test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [1, 2].

In the second test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [2, 1, 3].

In the third test sample it is impossible to add one temperature to obtain the minimum equal to 1 and the maximum equal to 3.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m, min_temp, max_temp) = map(int, input().split())
    temperatures = list(map(int, input().split()))
    contains_min = min_temp in temperatures
    contains_max = max_temp in temperatures
    additional_needed = n - m
    if contains_min and contains_max:
        print('Correct')
    elif additional_needed >= 2 or (additional_needed == 1 and (contains_min or contains_max)):
        print('Correct')
    else:
        print('Incorrect')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, min, max are integers where 1 ≤ m < n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ min < max ≤ 100. The list of m temperatures, t_i, consists of m integers where 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n, m, min_temp, max_temp = map(int, input().split())

If `additional_needed` is greater than or equal to 2, or if `additional_needed` is 1 and at least one of `contains_min` or `contains_max` is True, the current state remains unchanged. If `additional_needed` is less than 2 and not equal to 1, or if `additional_needed` is 1 and neither `contains_min` nor `contains_max` is True, the current state also remains unchanged.

If `contains_min` and `contains_max` are both True, the state remains unchanged. If either `contains_min` or `contains_max` is False, the state remains unchanged under the following conditions: `additional_needed` is greater than or equal to 2, or if `additional_needed` is 1 and at least one of `contains_min` or `contains_max` is True. If `additional_needed` is less than 2 and not equal to 1, or if `additional_needed` is 1 and neither `contains_min` nor `contains_max` is True, the state also remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program appears to handle all specified conditions correctly according to the problem description. It checks if the current list of temperatures already contains the minimum and maximum temperatures. If it does, it prints 'Correct'. If not, it checks if it has enough additional slots (n - m) to add at least the missing minimum or maximum temperature, or both, ensuring that the final set of temperatures will have the specified minimum and maximum values. The conditions under which it prints 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' seem to cover all the potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
