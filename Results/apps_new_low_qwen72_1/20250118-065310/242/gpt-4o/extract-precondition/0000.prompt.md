You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Not so long ago company R2 bought company R1 and consequently, all its developments in the field of multicore processors. Now the R2 laboratory is testing one of the R1 processors.

The testing goes in n steps, at each step the processor gets some instructions, and then its temperature is measured. The head engineer in R2 is keeping a report record on the work of the processor: he writes down the minimum and the maximum measured temperature in his notebook. His assistant had to write down all temperatures into his notebook, but (for unknown reasons) he recorded only m.

The next day, the engineer's assistant filed in a report with all the m temperatures. However, the chief engineer doubts that the assistant wrote down everything correctly (naturally, the chief engineer doesn't doubt his notes). So he asked you to help him. Given numbers n, m, min, max and the list of m temperatures determine whether you can upgrade the set of m temperatures to the set of n temperatures (that is add n - m temperatures), so that the minimum temperature was min and the maximum one was max.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers n, m, min, max (1 ≤ m < n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ min < max ≤ 100). The second line contains m space-separated integers t_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 100) — the temperatures reported by the assistant.

Note, that the reported temperatures, and the temperatures you want to add can contain equal temperatures.


-----Output-----

If the data is consistent, print 'Correct' (without the quotes). Otherwise, print 'Incorrect' (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2 1 1 2
1

Output
Correct

Input
3 1 1 3
2

Output
Correct

Input
2 1 1 3
2

Output
Incorrect



-----Note-----

In the first test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [1, 2].

In the second test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [2, 1, 3].

In the third test sample it is impossible to add one temperature to obtain the minimum equal to 1 and the maximum equal to 3.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
