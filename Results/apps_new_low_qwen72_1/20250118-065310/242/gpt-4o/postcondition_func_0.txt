The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `min_temp`, `max_temp`, and a list of `m` temperatures. It checks if the `min_temp` and `max_temp` are present in the `temperatures` list. Based on whether these temperatures are present and the number of additional temperatures needed (`n - m`), it prints 'Correct' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'Incorrect'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result based on the conditions. The final state of the program includes the original inputs and the printed output, which indicates whether the conditions for `min_temp` and `max_temp` being present or the possibility of adding them are satisfied.
