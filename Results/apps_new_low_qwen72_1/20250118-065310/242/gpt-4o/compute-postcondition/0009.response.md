Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m < n), `min_temp` is an integer (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100), `max_temp` is an integer (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100), `temperatures` is a list of `m` integers (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100), `contains_min` is True if `min_temp` is in `temperatures` else False, `contains_max` is True if `max_temp` is in `temperatures` else False, and `additional_needed` is `n - m`. If `contains_min` and `contains_max` are both True, the state remains unchanged. If either `contains_min` or `contains_max` is False, the state remains unchanged under the following conditions: `additional_needed` is greater than or equal to 2, or if `additional_needed` is 1 and at least one of `contains_min` or `contains_max` is True. If `additional_needed` is less than 2 and not equal to 1, or if `additional_needed` is 1 and neither `contains_min` nor `contains_max` is True, the state also remains unchanged.***
