The function `func` is expected to accept four parameters: `n`, `m`, `min`, and `max`, and a list of `m` temperatures, `t_i`. However, the function signature provided does not include these parameters, which suggests that the actual function signature should include these parameters for the description to be accurate.

Given the constraints and the expected output, let's assume the correct function signature is as follows:

```
def func(n, m, min, max, temperatures):
```

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m < n.
- `min` and `max` are integers where 1 ≤ min < max ≤ 100.
- `temperatures` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100.

Output:
- The function returns a list of `n - m` integers, each within the range `[min, max]`, such that the new list combined with the original `temperatures` list has exactly `n` elements, all within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `min`, `max`, and `temperatures`. It returns a list of `n - m` integers, each within the range `[min, max]`, ensuring that when combined with the `temperatures` list, the total length is `n` and all elements are within the specified range.**
