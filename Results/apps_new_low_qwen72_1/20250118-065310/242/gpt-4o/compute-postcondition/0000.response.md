The provided code snippet reads values for `n`, `m`, `min_temp`, and `max_temp` from input, then reads a list of `m` temperatures. It checks if `min_temp` and `max_temp` are present in the list of temperatures and calculates the number of additional temperatures needed to reach `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, `min_temp`, and `max_temp` are integers where 1 ≤ m < n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100.
- The list of `m` temperatures, `t_i`, consists of `m` integers where 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100.

After executing the code:
- `n`, `m`, `min_temp`, and `max_temp` retain their original values.
- `temperatures` is a list of `m` integers read from input.
- `contains_min` is a boolean indicating whether `min_temp` is in the `temperatures` list.
- `contains_max` is a boolean indicating whether `max_temp` is in the `temperatures` list.
- `additional_needed` is the difference between `n` and `m`.

Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is an integer (1 ≤ m < n), min_temp is an integer (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100), max_temp is an integer (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100), temperatures is a list of m integers (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100), contains_min is True if min_temp is in temperatures else False, contains_max is True if max_temp is in temperatures else False, additional_needed is n - m**
