Functionality: ** The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `min_temp`, `max_temp`, and a list of `m` temperatures. It checks if the `min_temp` and `max_temp` are present in the `temperatures` list. Based on whether these temperatures are present and the number of additional temperatures needed (`n - m`), it prints 'Correct' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'Incorrect'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result based on the conditions. The final state of the program includes the original inputs and the printed output, which indicates whether the conditions for `min_temp` and `max_temp` being present or the possibility of adding them are satisfied. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input values for `n`, `m`, `min_temp`, `max_temp`, and `temperatures` do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `1 ≤ m < n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100`), the behavior of the function is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect number of inputs).
- The function does not modify the `temperatures` list or any other variables; it only prints a result based on the given conditions.
- The function does not generate or return any additional temperatures to meet the `n` requirement; it only evaluates the current state and prints 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' based on the conditions.
