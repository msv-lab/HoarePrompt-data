Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m < n), `min_temp` is an integer (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100), `max_temp` is an integer (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100), `temperatures` is a list of `m` integers (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100), `contains_min` is True, `contains_max` is True, and `additional_needed` is `n - m`.***
