The provided code snippet only contains a print statement that outputs the string 'Correct'. This does not modify any of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m < n), `min_temp` is an integer (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100), `max_temp` is an integer (1 ≤ min_temp < max_temp ≤ 100), `temperatures` is a list of `m` integers (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100), `contains_min` is True if `min_temp` is in `temperatures` else False, `contains_max` is True if `max_temp` is in `temperatures` else False, `additional_needed` is `n - m`, and either `contains_min` is False or `contains_max` is False. The current value of `additional_needed` is such that either `additional_needed` is greater than or equal to 2, or `additional_needed` is 1 and at least one of `contains_min` or `contains_max` is True.**
