The function reads an integer `n` from the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by '2', '1', and `n // 2`, and finally '1' and `n`. The variable `k` is set to 2, but this assignment has no observable effect outside the function. After the function completes, the program prints the value of `k` (which is 2), and then prints '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`.
