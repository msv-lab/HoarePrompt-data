Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the input integer \( n \) is 2. If \( n \) is 2, it correctly outputs "NO" because there are no divisors \( b_i \) of 2 such that \( 1 < b_i < 2 \). For any other \( n \), the program outputs "YES" and constructs a sequence of fractions that satisfies the given conditions. However, there is a critical flaw in the sequence construction:

1. **Output "YES" when \( n > 2 \)**: This part is correct because for \( n > 2 \), there exist divisors \( b_i \) such that \( 1 < b_i < n \).

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program sets \( k = 2 \) and prints two fractions: \( \frac{1}{n // 2} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \).
   - The sum of these fractions is \( \frac{1}{n // 2} + \frac{1}{n} \).

   Let's analyze the sum:
   - \( \frac{1}{n // 2} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{2}{n} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{3}{n} \).

   The target sum is \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} = \frac{n-1}{n} \).

   Clearly, \( \frac{3}{n} \neq \frac{n-1}{n} \) for \( n > 3 \). Therefore, the constructed sequence does not satisfy the condition \( \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

3. **Special Case for \( n = 3 \)**:
   - For \( n = 3 \), the program constructs the sequence \( \frac{1}{1} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} \), which is clearly incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly construct the required sequence of fractions for \( n > 2 \).

Correctness: **False**
