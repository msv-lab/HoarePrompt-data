Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to meet the requirements for certain values of `n`. Specifically, the program assumes that the sequence of fractions can always be constructed with exactly two terms, which is not necessarily true for all valid `n`.

For example, consider `n = 4`:
- The program outputs:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 4
  ```
- However, the sum of these fractions is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
  \]
- This does not equal \(1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\), but the requirement is that the sum should be \(1 - \frac{1}{n} = \frac{3}{4}\). The program's output is correct in this case.

However, for `n = 8`:
- The program outputs:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 4
  1 8
  ```
- The sum of these fractions is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}
  \]
- This does not equal \(1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}\).

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and thus the correctness is **False**.
