You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` from the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by '2', '1', and `n // 2`, and finally '1' and `n`. The variable `k` is set to 2, but this assignment has no observable effect outside the function. After the function completes, the program prints the value of `k` (which is 2), and then prints '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to meet the requirements for certain values of `n`. Specifically, the program assumes that the sequence of fractions can always be constructed with exactly two terms, which is not necessarily true for all valid `n`.

For example, consider `n = 4`:
- The program outputs:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 4
  ```
- However, the sum of these fractions is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
  \]
- This does not equal \(1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\), but the requirement is that the sum should be \(1 - \frac{1}{n} = \frac{3}{4}\). The program's output is correct in this case.

However, for `n = 8`:
- The program outputs:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 4
  1 8
  ```
- The sum of these fractions is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}
  \]
- This does not equal \(1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}\).

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and thus the correctness is **False**.
