You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')

k = 2

print(k)

print('1', n // 2)

print('1', n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 2, the program does nothing specific (no changes to `n` or other variables). Otherwise, `k` is set to 2, 'YES' is printed, followed by '2', '1', and `n // 2`, and finally '1' and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by '2', '1', and `n // 2`, and finally '1' and `n`. The variable `k` is set to 2, but this assignment has no observable effect outside the function. After the function completes, the program prints the value of `k` (which is 2), and then prints '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program needs to solve the problem of finding a sequence of fractions that satisfy the conditions given. Let's break down the logic of the provided solution:

1. **Edge Case Handling (n = 2)**:
   - For \( n = 2 \), the value \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \). However, there are no divisors of 2 between 1 and 2, so it's impossible to form the required sequence. The program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.

2. **General Case (n > 2)**:
   - For \( n > 2 \), the program assumes that a valid sequence can be formed with \( k = 2 \) fractions.
   - It prints "YES" to indicate that a sequence exists.
   - It sets \( k = 2 \) and prints 2, indicating that there will be two fractions in the sequence.
   - It then prints the fractions \(\frac{1}{n // 2}\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\).

3. **Verification of the General Case**:
   - The fractions are \(\frac{1}{n // 2}\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\).
   - We need to check if their sum equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{n // 2} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor} + \frac{1}{n}
     \]
   - For even \( n \), \( n // 2 = \frac{n}{2} \), so:
     \[
     \frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{2}{n} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{3}{n}
     \]
     This does not equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

   - For odd \( n \), \( n // 2 = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \), so:
     \[
     \frac{1}{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor} + \frac{1}{n}
     \]
     This also does not necessarily equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not always produce a correct sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the sum of the fractions \(\frac{1}{n // 2}\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\) does not always equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
