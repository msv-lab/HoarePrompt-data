Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by '2', '1', and `n // 2`, and finally '1' and `n`. The variable `k` is set to 2, but this assignment has no observable effect outside the function. After the function completes, the program prints the value of `k` (which is 2), and then prints '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`. **

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` from the user, ensuring that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.
- **Conditional Logic**:
  - If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'.
  - For any other value of `n`, it prints 'YES'.
- **Additional Output**:
  - Regardless of the value of `n`, the function prints '2', '1', and `n // 2`, followed by '1' and `n`.
- **Variable `k`**: The variable `k` is set to 2, but this assignment does not affect the output of the function.
- **Final State**:
  - After the function completes, the program prints the value of `k` (which is 2).
  - It then prints '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`.

### Edge Cases:
- **n = 2**: The function correctly prints 'NO'.
- **n > 2**: The function correctly prints 'YES' followed by the additional outputs.
- **n < 2 or n > 10^9**: The function does not handle these cases, and the behavior is undefined for values outside the specified range.
