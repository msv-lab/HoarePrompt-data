The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, according to the parameter constraints, there is an implicit understanding that the function is designed to work with an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The description of the output is missing, so I cannot provide a complete description of what the function returns. If you can provide the expected output based on the value of `n`, I can finalize the functionality description.

For now, with the given information:
Functionality: **The function is designed to work with an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. (Output description needed)**

Please provide the expected output for the function based on the value of `n`.
