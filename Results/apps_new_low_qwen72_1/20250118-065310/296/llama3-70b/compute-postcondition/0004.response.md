The provided code snippet performs several print operations and updates a variable `k`. Here's the analysis:

- The first line prints 'YES'.
- The second line initializes `k` to 2.
- The third line prints the value of `k`, which is 2.
- The fourth line prints '1' followed by the integer division of `n` by 2.
- The fifth line prints '1' followed by the value of `n`.

The value of `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and it is not equal to 2. This value is taken as input and is used in the print statements.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n is not equal to 2, k is 2, 'YES' is printed, '2' is printed, '1' and n // 2 are printed, '1' and n are printed**
