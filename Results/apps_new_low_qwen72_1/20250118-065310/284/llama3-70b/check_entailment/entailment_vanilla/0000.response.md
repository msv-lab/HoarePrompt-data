Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to find a counterexample for the hypothesis that there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that for every positive integer \( m \), the expression \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. The program does this by iterating through possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checking if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number using the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) from the input.
   - This is correctly done using `n = int(input())`.

2. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime.
   - It returns `False` if the number is less than 2.
   - It checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number, returning `False` if any divisor is found.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented and efficiently checks for primality.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is not a prime number using `func_1`.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic is correct and ensures that a valid \( m \) is found within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. It uses a well-structured prime check function and iterates through the required range to find a suitable \( m \). Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
