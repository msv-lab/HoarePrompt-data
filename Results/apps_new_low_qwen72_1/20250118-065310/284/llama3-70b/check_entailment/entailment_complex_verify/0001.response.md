Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to disprove PolandBall's hypothesis by finding a counterexample where \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for some \( m \) in the range 1 to 1000. Let's break down the program and its components to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer \( n \) from the input using `n = int(input())`.

2. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime.
   - It returns `False` if the number is less than 2, which is correct because numbers less than 2 are not prime.
   - It checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number, returning `False` if any divisor is found. This is an efficient way to check for primality.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.
   - The function is correctly implemented and efficiently checks for primality.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is not a prime number using `func_1`.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic ensures that a valid \( m \) is found within the specified range, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Evaluation of Annotations:
- **State of the program before the function call:**
  - `num` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq num \leq 1000 \).
  - This is accurate as \( n \cdot m + 1 \) will always be a positive integer greater than 1 for the given range of \( m \).

- **State of the program after the if block has been executed:**
  - `num` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq num \leq 1000 \).
  - This is correct because the function returns `False` for numbers less than 2, and the program continues with numbers greater than or equal to 2.

- **State of the program after the for loop has been executed:**
  - `num` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq num \leq 1000 \), and `i` is \( \text{int}(num^{0.5}) \).
  - This is accurate as the loop checks divisibility up to the square root of `num`.

- **Final state of the program:**
  - The function has determined whether the input `num` is a prime number and returned the corresponding boolean value.
  - This is correct and aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. It uses a well-structured prime check function and iterates through the required range to find a suitable \( m \). The annotations and the original assessment are consistent with the program's behavior.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
