Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to check if a number is prime. It returns `False` if the number is less than 2 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The function efficiently checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is a standard and efficient way to determine primality.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this number is not prime using the `func_1` function.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - This approach ensures that the program will find a suitable \( m \) within the specified range, as there are always composite numbers in the sequence \( n \cdot m + 1 \) for sufficiently large \( m \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \). For \( n = 1 \), \( 1 \cdot m + 1 \) is \( m + 1 \). The smallest \( m \) that makes \( m + 1 \) non-prime is \( m = 1 \) (since \( 2 \) is prime, but \( 3 \) is not).
   - For larger values of \( n \), the program will eventually find a suitable \( m \) because the product \( n \cdot m + 1 \) will grow large enough to include composite numbers.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program is designed to handle all potential cases correctly. The annotations confirm that the program's state and logic are consistent with the requirements.

Final: **True**
