Reasoning:

The original assessment is thorough and accurately evaluates the correctness of the provided Python program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step using the annotated code and the original assessment:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer \( n \) from the input using `n = int(input())`.
   - This ensures that \( n \) is a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if a number is prime.
   - It returns `False` if the number is less than 2, which is correct because prime numbers are defined as natural numbers greater than 1.
   - It checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. This is an efficient way to determine if a number is prime.
   - If any divisor is found, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.
   - This function is correctly implemented and works efficiently.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is not a prime number using `func_1`.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic ensures that a valid \( m \) is found within the specified range (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

### Annotations Validation:
- **State before `func_1` call:** `num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000.
  - This is correct because \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is always a positive integer greater than 1 for the given range of \( n \) and \( m \).
- **State after the if block in `func_1`:** `num` is an integer such that 2 ≤ num ≤ 1000.
  - This is correct because the function returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, ensuring that only numbers greater than or equal to 2 are checked for primality.
- **State after the for loop in `func_1`:** `num` is an integer such that 2 ≤ num ≤ 1000.
  - This is correct because the for loop checks divisibility up to the square root of `num`, and if no divisors are found, `num` is confirmed to be prime.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. It uses a well-structured prime check function and iterates through the required range to find a suitable \( m \). The annotations and the original assessment are consistent and accurate.

Final: **True**
