Reasoning:  
The program is designed to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis that there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that for each positive integer \( m \), the expression \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. The program works as follows:

1. It takes an input \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)).
2. It iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
3. For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this number is not a prime using the function `func_1`.
4. If \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if a number is prime:
- It returns `False` if the number is less than 2.
- It checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`.
- If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

The logic of the program is sound:
- It correctly checks for non-prime numbers.
- It ensures that the value of \( m \) is within the specified range (1 to 1000).
- The problem guarantees that a suitable \( m \) always exists, so the program will always find and print a valid \( m \).

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
