### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, where \( n \) is a given positive integer. The program should work for \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \) and \( 1 \leq m \leq 1000 \).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) from the input.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number using the function `func_1`.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` determines whether a given number `num` is prime.
   - It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2.
   - For numbers greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of `num`.
   - If any divisor is found, it returns `False` (indicating `num` is not prime).
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True` (indicating `num` is prime).

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The main loop correctly iterates over possible values of \( m \).
   - The condition `if not func_1(n * m + 1)` ensures that the program stops when it finds a non-prime number.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies prime numbers.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n \) is 1, as it will eventually find \( m = 1 \) such that \( 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \) (which is prime) and continue until it finds \( m = 2 \) such that \( 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \) (which is also prime) and so on until it finds a non-prime.
   - The program guarantees that a non-prime will be found within the range \( 1 \leq m \leq 1000 \) because there are infinitely many composite numbers of the form \( n \cdot m + 1 \).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and meets the requirements of the problem statement. It correctly finds a non-prime number of the form \( n \cdot m + 1 \) for any \( n \) within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
