You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.

- Program:
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` (1 ≤ num ≤ 1000) and returns `True` if `num` is a prime number; otherwise, it returns `False`. If `num` is less than 2, the function immediately returns `False`. For numbers greater than or equal to 2, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If any such divisor is found, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The final state of the program is that the function has determined whether the input `num` is a prime number and returned the corresponding boolean value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to find a counterexample for the hypothesis that there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that for every positive integer \( m \), the expression \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. The program does this by iterating through possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checking if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number using the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) from the input.
   - This is correctly done using `n = int(input())`.

2. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime.
   - It returns `False` if the number is less than 2.
   - It checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number, returning `False` if any divisor is found.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented and efficiently checks for primality.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is not a prime number using `func_1`.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic is correct and ensures that a valid \( m \) is found within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. It uses a well-structured prime check function and iterates through the required range to find a suitable \( m \). Therefore, the program is correct.
