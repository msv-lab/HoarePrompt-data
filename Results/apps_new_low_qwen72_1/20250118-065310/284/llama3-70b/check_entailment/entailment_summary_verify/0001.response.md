### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate, and here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer \( n \) from the input using `n = int(input())`.

2. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if a number is prime.
   - It returns `False` for numbers less than 2, which is correct since prime numbers are defined as numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves.
   - For numbers greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. This is an efficient way to check for primality because a larger factor of the number would necessarily have a smaller factor that has already been checked.
   - The function returns `False` if any divisor is found, indicating that the number is not prime. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.
   - This implementation of `func_1` is correct and efficient.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is not a prime number using `func_1`.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - The logic ensures that the program will find and print a suitable \( m \) within the specified range, which is guaranteed to exist according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. It uses a well-structured prime check function and iterates through the required range to find a suitable \( m \). Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
