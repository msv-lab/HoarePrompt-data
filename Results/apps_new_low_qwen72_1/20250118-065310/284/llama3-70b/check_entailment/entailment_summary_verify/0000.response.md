### Reasoning:

1. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if a number is prime. It returns `False` if the number is less than 2 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The implementation is correct and efficient by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.
   - The function summary confirms that it correctly identifies prime numbers and non-prime numbers within the specified range.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and uses the `func_1` function to check if this number is not prime.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - This approach ensures that the program will find a suitable \( m \) within the given range, as there are guaranteed to be composite numbers in the sequence \( n \cdot m + 1 \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \). For \( n = 1 \), \( 1 \cdot m + 1 \) is \( m + 1 \). The smallest \( m \) that makes \( m + 1 \) non-prime is \( m = 1 \) (since \( 2 \) is prime, but \( 3 \) is not).
   - For larger values of \( n \), the program will eventually find a suitable \( m \) because the product \( n \cdot m + 1 \) will grow large enough to include composite numbers.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for any given \( n \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
   - The function `func_1` is used appropriately to determine the primality of the calculated values.
   - The iteration and breaking mechanism ensure that the program outputs a valid \( m \) within the specified range.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
