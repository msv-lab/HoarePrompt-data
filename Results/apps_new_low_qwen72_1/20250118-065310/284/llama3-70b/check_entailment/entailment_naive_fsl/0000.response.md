Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly find a counterexample for any given \( n \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for some \( m \) in the range \( 1 \leq m \leq 1000 \). Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime. It returns `False` if the number is less than 2 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - This function is implemented correctly and efficiently by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this number is not prime using the `func_1` function.
   - If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \). For \( n = 1 \), \( 1 \cdot m + 1 \) is \( m + 1 \). The smallest \( m \) that makes \( m + 1 \) non-prime is \( m = 1 \) (since \( 2 \) is prime, but \( 3 \) is not).
   - For larger values of \( n \), the program will eventually find a suitable \( m \) because the product \( n \cdot m + 1 \) will grow large enough to include composite numbers.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
