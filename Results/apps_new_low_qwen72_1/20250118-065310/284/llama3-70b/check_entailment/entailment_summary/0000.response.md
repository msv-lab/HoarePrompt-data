Reasoning:  
The program aims to disprove PolandBall's hypothesis by finding a counterexample where \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given \( n \). The program iterates over values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses the function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, the program prints \( m \) and breaks the loop.

The function `func_1` correctly determines if a number is prime:
- It returns `False` if the number is less than 2.
- It checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`.
- If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program logic is sound and should find a valid \( m \) for any \( n \) within the specified range. The execution summary confirms that `func_1` works as intended.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
