The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than or equal to the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `num` is an integer such that 4 < `num` ≤ 1000, with the condition that `num % i != 0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. Therefore, `num` must still satisfy 4 < `num` ≤ 1000, and `num % i != 0` must hold true for `i = 4`.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 4 < `num` ≤ 1000, `i` is 4, and `num % i != 0`. If `num % i` == 0, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `num` and `i`.**
