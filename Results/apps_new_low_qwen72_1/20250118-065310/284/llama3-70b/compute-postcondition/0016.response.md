Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` (1 ≤ num ≤ 1000) and returns `True` if `num` is a prime number; otherwise, it returns `False`. If `num` is less than 2, the function immediately returns `False`. For numbers greater than or equal to 2, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If any such divisor is found, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The final state of the program is that the function has determined whether the input `num` is a prime number and returned the corresponding boolean value. **
