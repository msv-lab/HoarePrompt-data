The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000. Based on the given cases, the function returns `False` in four scenarios (Cases 1-4) and `True` in one scenario (Case 5). However, without additional details on the conditions for each case, we can only generalize based on the possible outcomes.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `num` within the range 1 to 1000, inclusive, and return `True` under a specific condition (Case 5); otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `num` (1 ≤ num ≤ 1000) and returns `True` under a specific condition; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
