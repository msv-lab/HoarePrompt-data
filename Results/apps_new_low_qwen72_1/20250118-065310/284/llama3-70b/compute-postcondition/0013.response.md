To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). For each value of `i`, it checks if `num` is divisible by `i`. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns `False`. If no divisors are found, the function implicitly returns `True` after the loop completes.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`num`**: This variable remains constant throughout the loop.
- **`i`**: This variable increments from 2 to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute as long as there is no divisor of `num` within the range [2, int(sqrt(num))].
- If `num` is prime, the loop will complete without finding any divisors.
- If `num` is composite, the loop will find a divisor and return `False`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The loop does not modify `num`.
- The loop increments `i` and checks divisibility.
- If `num` is prime, the loop will complete without returning `False`.

### Final Output State
- **`num`**: Remains the same as the initial state.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
- **Return Value**: The function returns `False` if any divisor is found; otherwise, it returns `True`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
- The loop will execute if `num` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The loop will not execute if `num` is 1 (but this is outside the given range).

### Output State
Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 2 ≤ num ≤ 1000, `i` is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, and the function returns `True` if `num` is prime, otherwise `False`.**
