The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit of the loop, which is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `num` is an integer such that 4 ≤ num ≤ 1000
- `i` is 2
- `num % i != 0`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3
- The loop condition `i < int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must still hold true

Since `i` is now 3, the condition `3 < int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be satisfied for the loop to continue. This means that `num` must be such that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 3.

Given that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1 > 3`, it follows that `int(num ** 0.5) > 2`, and thus `num > 4`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is an integer such that 4 < num ≤ 1000, `i` is 3, and `num % i != 0`**
