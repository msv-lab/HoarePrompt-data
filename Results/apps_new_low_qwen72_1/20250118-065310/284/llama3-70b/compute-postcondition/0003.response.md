To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will start.

Given:
- The state before the loop starts: `num` is an integer such that 2 ≤ num ≤ 1000.
- The loop statement: `for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):`

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop head involves the variables `i` and `num`.
2. The loop will execute if the range `range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)` is not empty.
3. For the range to be non-empty, the upper bound of the range (exclusive) must be greater than or equal to the lower bound (inclusive).
4. The lower bound is 2.
5. The upper bound is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 2.
- This simplifies to `int(num ** 0.5) >= 2`.
- Since `int(num ** 0.5)` is the integer part of the square root of `num`, this means `num` must be at least 4 (because the square root of 4 is 2).

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `num` must be at least 4.
- `i` will start at 2.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 4 ≤ num ≤ 1000, `i` is 2**
