The value of `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2. The initial value of `max_jump` depends on whether `s[1]` is a vowel or not, but it is either 0 or `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

- If `s[1]` is in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is set to 1, and `max_jump` is updated to `(-1) // 2 + 1` which equals 0.
- If `s[1]` is not in `vowels`, `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` remains 0.

In both cases, `max_jump` is initially 0 or 1. Since `i + 1` is 2, `max_jump` will be updated to 2 because 2 is greater than both 0 and 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is either 1 or -1, `max_jump` is 2.
