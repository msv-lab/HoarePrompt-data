Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is 2, and `max_jump` is 1. If `s[2]` is not in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is -1, and `max_jump` is 2. If `last_vowel` was initially -1 (indicating `s[2]` is not in `vowels`), `max_jump` is updated to 3.***
