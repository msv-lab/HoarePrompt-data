The code snippet updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1. Therefore, `max_jump` is updated to 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. The character at position `i` in `s` is one of the vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'), and `last_vowel` is still -1. The string `s` remains a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character at position `i` in `s` is one of the vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y').**
