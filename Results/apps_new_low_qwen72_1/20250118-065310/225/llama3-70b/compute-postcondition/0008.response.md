`last_vowel` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 0. The conditions about `s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `max_jump` remain unchanged. Since `last_vowel` was not -1 before, `max_jump` is calculated as `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. However, since `last_vowel` is now set to 0, this calculation does not apply to the new value of `last_vowel`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `last_vowel` is 0, `max_jump` is `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1` (previously calculated value).**
