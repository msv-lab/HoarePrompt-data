Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s[0]` is in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is set to 0, and `max_jump` is updated to `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` remains 0.***
