The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is set to 1, and `max_jump` is updated to `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` remains 0.**
