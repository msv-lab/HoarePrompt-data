Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s` (or half the distance plus one if the distance is odd), `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s`. If no vowels are present in `s`, `max_jump` remains 0 and `last_vowel` remains -1. The current value of `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`.***
