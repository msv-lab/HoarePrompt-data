The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `last_vowel`. Given that `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 1, `max_jump` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[1]` is in `vowels` or not.**
