To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`.
- `vowels` is the string 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `max_jump` is 0.
- `last_vowel` is -1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variable (`i`)**:
   - The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and iterate up to `n-1` (inclusive).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string, so `n` (the length of `s`) is at least 1.
   - `max_jump` is 0.
   - `last_vowel` is -1.
   - `i` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be 0. The other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `max_jump`, and `last_vowel`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to start, but their initial values are part of the state.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0**
