Functionality: ** The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters (length â‰¤ 100) from user input. It calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string, considering the distance to the start or end of the string if no preceding or following vowel is found, respectively. The function then prints this maximum distance. If the string contains no vowels, the function prints 0. The function does not return any value. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **No Vowels in the String:** If the string `s` contains no vowels, the function correctly sets `max_jump` to 0 and prints 0.
- **Single Vowel at the Start or End:** If the string `s` contains only one vowel at the start or end, the function correctly calculates the maximum distance from the start or end to the single vowel.
- **Multiple Vowels:** The function correctly calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, including handling odd distances by taking the ceiling of the half-distance.
- **Empty Input Handling:** The function does not handle empty input strings, as the initial comment specifies that the input is non-empty. However, if an empty string were provided, the function would raise an error when attempting to read the length of `s`.
- **Input Length Validation:** The function does not validate the length of the input string to ensure it does not exceed 100 characters, relying on the initial comment for this constraint.
