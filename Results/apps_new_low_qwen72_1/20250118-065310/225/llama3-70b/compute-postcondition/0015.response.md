Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is set to 1, and `max_jump` is updated to 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[1]` is in `vowels`. Otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` remains 0.***
