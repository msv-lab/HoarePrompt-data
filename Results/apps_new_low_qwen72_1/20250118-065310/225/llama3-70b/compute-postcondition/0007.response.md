Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the character at position `i` in `s` is one of the vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'). If `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` is 1 and `last_vowel` remains -1. Otherwise, `max_jump` is `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1` and `last_vowel` is not -1.***
