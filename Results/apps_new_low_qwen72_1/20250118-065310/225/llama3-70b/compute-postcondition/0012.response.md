The code updates `max_jump` by taking the maximum of its current value and a new calculated value, which is `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `s[1]` is in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is set to 1, and `max_jump` is updated to `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` remains 0.

Let's evaluate the new value of `max_jump`:
- If `last_vowel` is 1 (because `s[1]` is a vowel), then the new value for `max_jump` is `(1 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 1`.
- If `last_vowel` is -1 (because `s[1]` is not a vowel), then the new value for `max_jump` is `(1 - (-1)) // 2 + 1 = 2`.

Since `max_jump` was initially 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[1]` is a vowel, the new value of `max_jump` will be the maximum of these two values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `s[1]` is in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is 1 and `max_jump` is 1, otherwise `last_vowel` is -1 and `max_jump` is 2.**
