Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s`, if no vowels are present in `s`, `max_jump` remains 0 and `last_vowel` remains -1. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `max_jump` remains unchanged.***
