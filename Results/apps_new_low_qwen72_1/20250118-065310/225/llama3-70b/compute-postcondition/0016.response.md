The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is in `vowels`, `last_vowel` is set to 2, and `max_jump` is updated to 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is in `vowels`. Otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` remains 0.**
