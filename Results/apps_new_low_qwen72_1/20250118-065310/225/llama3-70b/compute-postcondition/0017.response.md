The value of `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. Since `max_jump` was previously set to 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is in `vowels`, the new value of `max_jump` will be 3, as 3 is greater than both 1 and 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2 if `s[2]` is in `vowels` otherwise -1, `max_jump` is 3.
