The code snippet `last_vowel = i` assigns the value of `i` to `last_vowel`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `last_vowel` will now also be 2. This overrides the previous conditions that set `last_vowel` based on whether `s[2]` is in `vowels`.

Since `last_vowel` is now explicitly set to 2, the condition that checks if `last_vowel` was initially -1 (to update `max_jump` to 3) no longer applies. The value of `max_jump` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `last_vowel` is 2.
- `max_jump` is 1 (unchanged).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2, `max_jump` is 1.**
