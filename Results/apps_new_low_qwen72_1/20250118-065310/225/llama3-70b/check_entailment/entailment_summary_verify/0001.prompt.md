You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----

Output
4
Input
AAA

Output
1

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel != n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    print(max_jump)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters (length ≤ 100) from user input. It calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string, considering the distance to the start or end of the string if no preceding or following vowel is found, respectively. The function then prints this maximum distance. If the string contains no vowels, the function prints 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string by only jumping on vowels. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Position**: The Grasshopper starts just before the first character of the string.
2. **Goal**: The Grasshopper needs to reach the position right after the last character of the string.
3. **Jump Ability**: The Grasshopper can jump a distance from 1 to the value of its jump ability.

The provided program works as follows:

- It reads the input string `s`.
- It initializes a set of vowels `vowels` and variables `max_jump` and `last_vowel`.
- It iterates through the string to find the positions of vowels.
- For each vowel found, it calculates the maximum jump required to reach the next vowel or the end of the string.
- If the last vowel is not at the end of the string, it calculates the final jump required to reach beyond the last character.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `vowels = 'AEIOUY'`: This is the set of vowels.
   - `max_jump = 0`: This will store the maximum jump required.
   - `last_vowel = -1`: This will store the index of the last vowel encountered.

2. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - For each character in the string, if it is a vowel, the program calculates the maximum jump required to reach this vowel from the previous vowel.
   - If it is the first vowel encountered (`last_vowel == -1`), the jump is from the start to this vowel.
   - Otherwise, the jump is from the last vowel to this vowel, divided by 2 (to ensure the Grasshopper can jump to the middle and then to the next vowel).

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the loop, if the last vowel is not at the end of the string, the program calculates the jump required to reach beyond the last character of the string.

The logic correctly handles all edge cases, including:
- When the string starts with a vowel.
- When the string ends with a vowel.
- When there are multiple vowels in the string.
- When the string has no vowels (though the problem guarantees the string is non-empty and contains at least one vowel).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string by jumping only on vowels.
