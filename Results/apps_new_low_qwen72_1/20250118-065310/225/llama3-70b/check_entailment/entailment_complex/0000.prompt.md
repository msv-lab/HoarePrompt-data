Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a non-empty string s consisting of uppercase English letters, where the length of s does not exceed 100.
def func():
    s = input()

vowels = 'AEIOUY'

n = len(s)

max_jump = 0

last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s` (or half the distance plus one if the distance is odd), `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s`. If no vowels are present in `s`, `max_jump` remains 0 and `last_vowel` remains -1.
    if (last_vowel != n - 1) :
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with length `n`, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s`, if no vowels are present in `s`, `max_jump` remains 0 and `last_vowel` remains -1. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `max_jump` remains unchanged.
    print(max_jump)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters (length ≤ 100) from user input. It calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string, considering the distance to the start or end of the string if no preceding or following vowel is found, respectively. The function then prints this maximum distance. If the string contains no vowels, the function prints 0. The function does not return any value.
