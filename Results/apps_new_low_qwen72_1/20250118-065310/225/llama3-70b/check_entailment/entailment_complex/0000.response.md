Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads a string `s` from the user input, which is expected to be a non-empty string of uppercase English letters with a length not exceeding 100. This matches the problem's input requirements.

2. **Vowel Identification**: The function correctly identifies vowels using the set `vowels = 'AEIOUY'`.

3. **Jump Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `max_jump` to 0 and `last_vowel` to -1.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each vowel encountered, it updates `max_jump` to ensure it holds the maximum distance required to jump from the last vowel to the current vowel.
     - If `last_vowel` is -1 (indicating the first vowel), `max_jump` is updated to `i + 1` (distance from the start to the first vowel).
     - Otherwise, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` (half the distance between the last vowel and the current vowel, rounded up).
   - After updating `max_jump`, `last_vowel` is set to the current index `i`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the last character in the string is a vowel. If not, it updates `max_jump` to account for the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
   - Specifically, it sets `max_jump` to the maximum of its current value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

5. **Output**: The function prints `max_jump`, which represents the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string by only jumping on vowels.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string contains no vowels, `max_jump` will remain 0, and the function will correctly print 0.
   - If the string starts with a vowel, the initial jump distance is correctly calculated.
   - If the string ends with a vowel, the final check ensures the correct distance is considered.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to handle all edge cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
