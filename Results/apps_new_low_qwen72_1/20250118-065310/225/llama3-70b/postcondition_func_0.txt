The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters (length â‰¤ 100) from user input. It calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string, considering the distance to the start or end of the string if no preceding or following vowel is found, respectively. The function then prints this maximum distance. If the string contains no vowels, the function prints 0. The function does not return any value.
