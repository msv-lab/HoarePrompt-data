You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer `n` representing the number of participants in a competition, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`. For each participant, it reads two integers `a_i` and `b_i` (where `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`), representing the rating of the participant before and after the competition, respectively. The participants are ordered from the top to the bottom of the standings. The function then determines the type of the competition based on the following criteria:
- If any participant's rating has changed (`a_i ≠ b_i` for any `i`), the competition is classified as "rated".
- If the relative order of any two participants has changed (i.e., if `a_i < a_j` but `b_i > b_j` for any `i < j`), the competition is classified as "unrated".
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the competition is classified as "maybe".

The function prints one of the three possible outcomes: "rated", "unrated", or "maybe". After the function executes, the state of the program is:
- `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`.
- `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing the ratings before and after the competition, respectively, each with `n` elements.
- The variables `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` are boolean values that determine the classification of the competition.
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it determines if the round is unrated. Specifically, the condition for setting `unrated` to `False` is incorrect. The program checks if there is a pair of participants where the participant with a lower initial rating ends up with a higher final rating. However, this check is not necessary to determine if the round is unrated. Instead, the program should only consider whether the participants' ratings are consistent with a non-rated round.

A correct approach would be to check if the ratings are consistent with a non-rated round by ensuring that no participant's rating changes and that the participants are ordered by their initial ratings. If these conditions are met, the round could be unrated. If any participant's rating changes, the round is definitely rated. If no participant's rating changes but the order of initial ratings is not consistent with the final standings, the round is unrated.

Here is a case where the program fails:
```
Input:
4
1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400
```
Expected Output:
```
unrated
```
Actual Output:
```
maybe
```
In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "maybe" instead of "unrated" because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the initial ratings are not in the same order as the final standings, even though no one's rating has changed.
