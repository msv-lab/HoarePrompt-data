Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624

Output
rated

Input

1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input

3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings_before.append(a)
        ratings_after.append(b)
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        if not unrated:
            break
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
    if rated:
        print('rated')
    elif unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')





# Execution Summary:
This function reads an integer `n` representing the number of participants in a competition, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`. For each participant, it reads two integers `a_i` and `b_i` (where `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`), representing the rating of the participant before and after the competition, respectively. The participants are ordered from the top to the bottom of the standings. The function then determines the type of the competition based on the following criteria:
- If any participant's rating has changed (`a_i ≠ b_i` for any `i`), the competition is classified as "rated".
- If the relative order of any two participants has changed (i.e., if `a_i < a_j` but `b_i > b_j` for any `i < j`), the competition is classified as "unrated".
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the competition is classified as "maybe".

The function prints one of the three possible outcomes: "rated", "unrated", or "maybe". After the function executes, the state of the program is:
- `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`.
- `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing the ratings before and after the competition, respectively, each with `n` elements.
- The variables `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` are boolean values that determine the classification of the competition.
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console.
