The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the nearest enclosing loop (such as a `for` or `while` loop) or from an `if` statement. Since there is no loop specified in the provided code snippet, we assume the `break` is part of a loop or conditional structure that is not shown. The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables directly but affects the flow of control.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`
- `ratings_before` is []
- `ratings_after` is []
- `_` is not used
- `rated` is False
- `unrated` is False
- `maybe` is True
- `j` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, or `j` is the value where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` for the first such `j`
- `unrated` is False

The `break` statement only affects the flow of the program and does not alter the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the program exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional structure.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `j` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, or `j` is the value where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` for the first such `j`, `unrated` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
