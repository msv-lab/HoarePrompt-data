To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions provided:

### Given Loop:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`
- `ratings_before` is []
- `ratings_after` is []
- `_` is not used
- `rated` is False
- `unrated` is False
- `maybe` is True
- `j` is `i + 2`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j`**: After the previous iteration, `j` was `i + 2`. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it `i + 3`.
- **`n`**: `n` must remain greater than the new value of `j` for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`
- `ratings_before` is []
- `ratings_after` is []
- `_` is not used
- `rated` is False
- `unrated` is False
- `maybe` is True
- `j` is `i + 3`
- `n` must be greater than `i + 3`

### State:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `j` is `i + 3`, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`**
