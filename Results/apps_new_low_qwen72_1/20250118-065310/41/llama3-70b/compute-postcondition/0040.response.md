To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`.
- `ratings_before` is an empty list.
- `ratings_after` is an empty list.
- `_` is not used.
- `rated` is False.
- `unrated` is False.
- `maybe` is True.
- `j` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, or `j` is the value where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` for the first such `j`.
- If `not unrated` is true, `unrated` remains False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `n - 1` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - `i` must be at least 2 and less than `n` (given).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (given).
   - Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Initial Values of Variables:**
   - `ratings_before` is an empty list.
   - `ratings_after` is an empty list.
   - `_` is not used.
   - `rated` is False.
   - `unrated` is False.
   - `maybe` is True.
   - `j` is not defined before the loop, but it will be set to `i + 1` on the first iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be at least 2 and less than `n`.
- `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Thus, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop executes the first time, is:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `j` is `i + 1`**
