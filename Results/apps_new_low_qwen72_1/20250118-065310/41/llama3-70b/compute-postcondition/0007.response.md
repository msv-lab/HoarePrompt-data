Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 0, ratings_before is [a, a_new, ..., a_final] with n elements, ratings_after is [b, b_new, ..., b_final] with n elements, _ is not used**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
   - In each iteration, two integers `a` and `b` are read from input.
   - These values are appended to the lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, respectively.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` grow by one element per iteration.
   - The loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the loop's behavior.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After `n` iterations, both `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` will contain `n` elements.
   - The loop will execute exactly `n` times as long as `n` is within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop's behavior is consistent with the provided intermediate states.
   - After the loop finishes, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` will each have `n` elements, and `n` will be 0 if we consider the loop has completed its execution.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed `n` times is:
- `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 0 (indicating the loop has completed).
- `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` elements.
- `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` elements.
- The loop variable `_` is not used and has no impact on the final state.
