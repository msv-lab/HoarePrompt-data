Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True. If `unrated` is set to False during any iteration, the loop terminates immediately. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0.**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The outer loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The inner loop iterates over `j` from `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - The condition checks if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`.
   - If this condition is met, `unrated` is set to False, and both loops terminate.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` is constant and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are empty lists and do not change.
   - `_` is not used and remains unchanged.
   - `rated` remains False as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `unrated` can change to False if the condition is met, causing the loop to terminate.
   - `maybe` remains True as it is not modified in the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will terminate early if the condition is met, setting `unrated` to False.
   - If no such pair `(i, j)` is found, the loop will complete all iterations, but `unrated` will still be False if it was set to False at any point.
   - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The conditions provided for the first few iterations are consistent with the loop behavior.
   - The final state reflects the loop's termination condition and the invariance of certain variables.
