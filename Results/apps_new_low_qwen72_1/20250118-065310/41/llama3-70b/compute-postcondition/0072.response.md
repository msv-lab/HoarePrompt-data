The provided Python code snippet only contains a `print` statement. This statement outputs the string 'maybe' to the console. Since this is a side effect and does not alter any of the variables in the initial state, none of the variables are changed.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1` or less, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True.**
