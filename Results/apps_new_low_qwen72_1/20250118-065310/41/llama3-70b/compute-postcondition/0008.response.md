The provided code snippet initializes three boolean variables: `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe`. These variables are set to `False`, `True`, and `True`, respectively. The initial state includes `n`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, and `_`, but these are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is 0, ratings_before is [], ratings_after is [], _ is not used, rated is False, unrated is True, maybe is True**
