The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 1. Since the initial state specifies that `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`, this condition is already satisfied, ensuring the loop will execute.

However, the initial state also mentions that `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are empty lists. These variables do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state and should be included in the modified state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `_` is not used (it's a placeholder for the loop variable)**
