The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True. If `ratings_before[1]` and `ratings_after[1]` are different, `rated` is True and `maybe` is True. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
