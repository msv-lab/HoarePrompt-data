Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1` is less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, `j` is `i + 2` and `j` is less than `n`. If `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is set to False. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
