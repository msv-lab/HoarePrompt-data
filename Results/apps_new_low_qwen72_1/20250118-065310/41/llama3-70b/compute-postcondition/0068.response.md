Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1` or less, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True. The loop will terminate if `unrated` is set to False during any iteration, or it will complete all iterations if no such condition is met.**
