The `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional block. Since the initial state specifies that the loop will not execute if `i + 1 >= n`, the `break` statement indicates that the program exits from the loop or conditional block immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow is affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1` is less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
