The provided code snippet takes an input string, splits it into two integers `a` and `b`, appends `a` to the `ratings_before` list, and appends `b` to the `ratings_after` list. Initially, both `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are empty lists. After executing the code, both lists will contain one element each, where `ratings_before` contains `a` and `ratings_after` contains `b`.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, ratings_before is [a], ratings_after is [b], _ is not used**
