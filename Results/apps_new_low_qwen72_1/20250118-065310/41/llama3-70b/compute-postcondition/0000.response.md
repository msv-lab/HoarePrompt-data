The provided code snippet initializes two lists, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, which are intended to store the ratings of participants before and after a round, respectively. The variable `n` is set to the integer value of user input, which is constrained to be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. The lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are initially empty.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, ratings_before is an empty list, ratings_after is an empty list**
