Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True. If `ratings_before[2]` and `ratings_after[2]` are different, `rated` is True and `maybe` remains True. Otherwise, the values of `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` remain unchanged.***
