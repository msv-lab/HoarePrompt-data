Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `j` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, or `j` is the value where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` for the first such `j`. The loop will execute as long as there exists a `j` in the range `(i + 1, n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`. If no such `j` is found, the loop completes and `j` becomes `n - 1`.**
