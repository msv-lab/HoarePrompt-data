To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

- The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, n):`.
- The variables in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`.
   - `ratings_before` is [].
   - `ratings_after` is [].
   - `_` is not used.
   - `rated` is False.
   - `unrated` is False.
   - `maybe` is True.
   - `j` is `i + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `j` is in the range from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains at least 2 and less than `n`.
- `ratings_before` remains [].
- `ratings_after` remains [].
- `_` remains unused.
- `rated` remains False.
- `unrated` remains False.
- `maybe` remains True.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `i + 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `j` is `i + 2`.**
