The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n` and the current iteration count. Since `_` is not used and is incremented implicitly by the loop, we focus on `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999, and the loop has executed once, reducing the number of remaining iterations by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 998, ratings_before is [a, a_new], ratings_after is [b, b_new], _ is not used**
