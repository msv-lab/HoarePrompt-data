To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is at least 1 and `i` is less than `n`
- `ratings_before` is []
- `ratings_after` is []
- `_` is not used
- `rated` is False
- `unrated` is False
- `maybe` is True

### Loop Condition:
```
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(i + 1, n)` is not empty. This means that `i + 1` must be less than `n`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` must be at least 2 and less than or equal to `n - 1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i + 1 < n` (which is already implied by `i < n` and `i >= 1`).

Given the initial state, the only variables that affect the loop execution are `i` and `n`. The other variables (`ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `_`, `rated`, `unrated`, `maybe`) do not influence the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1 and `i` is less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `j` is `i + 1`**
