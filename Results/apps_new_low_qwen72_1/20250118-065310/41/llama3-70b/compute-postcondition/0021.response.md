Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1` is less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False if there exists any `j` such that `i + 1 <= j < n` and `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`; otherwise, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True. The loop will not execute if `i + 1 >= n`. Additionally, `unrated` is False.***
