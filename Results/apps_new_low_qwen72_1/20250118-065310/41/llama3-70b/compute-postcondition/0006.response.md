The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. These values are then appended to the lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, respectively. The variable `_` is not used and remains unchanged. The value of `n` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 998, ratings_before is [a, a_new, a], ratings_after is [b, b_new, b], _ is not used**
