The provided code snippet takes two integers as input and appends them to the lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, respectively. Given the initial state, `ratings_before` starts with a single element `[a]`, and `ratings_after` starts with a single element `[b]`. After executing the code, both lists will have their respective new elements appended.

Here's the detailed analysis:

- The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The second line appends the new value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`.
- The third line appends the new value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`.

Since the initial values of `a` and `b` in the lists are not specified beyond being single elements, and the new values of `a` and `b` are taken from the input, the final state will include these updated lists.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999, ratings_before is [a, a_new], ratings_after is [b, b_new], _ is not used**

Where `a_new` and `b_new` are the new integers read from the input.
