To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions:

1. **Loop Control Variable (`i`)**: The loop control variable `i` is initialized by the `range(n)` function. This means `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(n)`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `ratings_before` is an empty list.
   - `ratings_after` is an empty list.
   - `_` is not used (this is typically a placeholder for unused variables in Python).
   - `rated` is `False`.
   - `unrated` is `False`.
   - `maybe` is `True`.

Given these conditions, the key factors that determine whether the loop will execute are `n` and `i`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts must ensure that:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0 (since it is the first iteration).

The other variables (`ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `_`, `rated`, `unrated`, `maybe`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True**
