To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the loop head and the conditions it imposes.

The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n):
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1` is less than `n`
- `ratings_before` is []
- `ratings_after` is []
- `_` is not used
- `rated` is False
- `unrated` is False
- `maybe` is True

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute again if `i < n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1` is less than `n`. This means `i` is currently some value such that `i < n - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
4. **Condition Check**: After incrementing `i`, the condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `i + 1 < n` was true at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 will make `i` equal to `i + 1`, and the condition `i < n` will still be true.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same, and it must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1 and `i` is less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, and `maybe` is True.**
