Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1` or less, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `maybe` is True. If `rated` is True, then at least one `ratings_before[j]` is different from `ratings_after[j]` for `j` in range(`n`), and `unrated` is False. If `rated` is False, then `rated` remains False, and `unrated` remains unchanged (either True or False).***
