The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i + 3`, and `n` must still be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `j` is `i + 3`. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, the condition is met; otherwise, the condition is not met.**
