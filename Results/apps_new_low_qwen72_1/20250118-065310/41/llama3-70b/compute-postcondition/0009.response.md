To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions that control the loop's execution. In this case, the loop is controlled by the value of `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 0
- `ratings_before` is an empty list `[]`
- `ratings_after` is an empty list `[]`
- `_` is not used
- `rated` is `False`
- `unrated` is `True`
- `maybe` is `True`

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if and only if `n` is greater than 0.
2. In the given state, `n` is 0, which means the loop will not execute.

### Required State for the Loop to Execute:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `_`, `rated`, `unrated`, `maybe`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they should remain consistent with the initial state unless otherwise specified.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True**
