The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is not used) and `n`. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and since the loop has already executed once, `n` must now be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999 for the loop to execute one more time.

However, since `_` is not used and does not affect the loop condition, no adjustments are needed for it. The only adjustment is to `n`.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999, ratings_before is [a], ratings_after is [b], _ is not used**
