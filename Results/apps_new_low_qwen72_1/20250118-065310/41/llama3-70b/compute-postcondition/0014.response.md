The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. The loop can execute again if `j` is within the range from `i + 1` to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1` is less than `n`.
- `j` was in the range `i + 1` to `n - 1` during the last iteration.

For the next iteration:
- `j` should be incremented by 1.
- `j` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the new state is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1` is less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, `j` is `i + 2` and `j` is less than `n`**
