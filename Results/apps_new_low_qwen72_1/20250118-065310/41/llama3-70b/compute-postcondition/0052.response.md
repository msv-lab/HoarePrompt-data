The `break` statement causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop (if inside one) or the nearest enclosing conditional statement (like an `if` block). Since the provided context suggests that the `break` statement is within a loop or conditional block, executing it will cause the program to exit this block immediately.

However, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, we assume the `break` is intended to exit from the described loop logic. Given this, the state of the program just before the `break` would be maintained, except for the fact that the loop or conditional block is exited.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `j` is the value where the loop was broken, or `j` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.**
