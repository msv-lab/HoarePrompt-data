To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions that control the loop's execution. The loop is defined as:

```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variables:**
   - `i`: This is the starting point for the range of the loop.
   - `n`: This is the upper limit (exclusive) for the range of the loop.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(i + 1, n)` is not empty. This means that `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ratings_before` is an empty list.
   - `ratings_after` is an empty list.
   - `_` is not used.
   - `rated` is False.
   - `unrated` is True.
   - `maybe` is True.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` must be such that `i + 1 < n`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if `i` is at least 0 and `i + 1 < n`.
- The other variables (`ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `_`, `rated`, `unrated`, `maybe`) do not directly affect the loop's execution but are part of the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be at least 0 and `i + 1` must be less than `n`, `ratings_before` is [], `ratings_after` is [], `_` is not used, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True**
