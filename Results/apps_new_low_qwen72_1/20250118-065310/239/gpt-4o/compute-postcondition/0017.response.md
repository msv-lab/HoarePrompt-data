Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)), `m` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10\)), `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)). It returns `max_cost`, which is the maximum value of `current_sum - k * ceil((i + 1) / m) - min_prefix` over all iterations where `i + 1 >= m`. If `n = 0`, the function returns 0. The function computes the maximum cost based on the cumulative sum of elements in the list `a` adjusted by a cost factor involving `k` and `m`, and tracks the minimum prefix cost to find the optimal result. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `n = 0`, the function correctly returns 0 without executing the loop.
- The function assumes that `m` and `k` are always positive integers within their specified ranges, and `a` is a valid list of integers. If these assumptions are violated, the function may produce incorrect results or raise exceptions.
- The function does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are outside their specified ranges or where `a` contains non-integer values or is not a list. These edge cases should be considered for robustness.
