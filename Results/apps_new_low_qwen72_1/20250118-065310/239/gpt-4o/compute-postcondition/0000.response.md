The provided code initializes three variables: `max_cost`, `current_sum`, and `min_prefix`. These variables are set to 0. The initial state provides the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`, but the given code snippet does not modify these variables.

Here is the final state after executing the code:

Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9, max_cost is 0, current_sum is 0, min_prefix is 0**
