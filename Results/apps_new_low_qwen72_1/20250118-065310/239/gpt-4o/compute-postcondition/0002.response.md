The value of `current_sum` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the index `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_cost` is 0, `current_sum` is `a[0]`, `min_prefix` is 0**
