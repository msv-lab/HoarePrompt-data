Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `max_cost` is 0, `current_sum` is `a[0]`, `min_prefix` is 0, and the current value of `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `m`***
