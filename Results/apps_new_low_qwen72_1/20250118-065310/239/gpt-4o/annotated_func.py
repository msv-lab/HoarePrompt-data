#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, m, k, a):
    max_cost = 0

current_sum = 0

min_prefix = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_sum += a[i]
        
        if i + 1 >= m:
            current_cost = current_sum - k * math.ceil((i + 1) / m)
            max_cost = max(max_cost, current_cost - min_prefix)
            min_prefix = min(min_prefix, current_cost)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `current_sum` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `max_cost` is the maximum value of \( \text{current\_sum} - k \cdot \lceil (i + 1) / m \rceil - \text{min\_prefix} \) over all iterations where \(i + 1 \geq m\), and `min_prefix` is the minimum value of \( \text{current\_sum} - k \cdot \lceil (i + 1) / m \rceil \) over all iterations where \(i + 1 \geq m\). If the loop never executes (i.e., \(n = 0\)), then `current_sum` remains 0, `max_cost` remains 0, and `min_prefix` remains 0.
    return max_cost
    #The program returns `max_cost`, which is the maximum value of `current_sum - k * ceil((i + 1) / m) - min_prefix` over all iterations where `i + 1 >= m`. If the loop never executes (i.e., `n = 0`), then `max_cost` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)), `m` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10\)), `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)). It returns `max_cost`, which is the maximum value of `current_sum - k * ceil((i + 1) / m) - min_prefix` over all iterations where `i + 1 >= m`. If `n = 0`, the function returns 0. The function computes the maximum cost based on the cumulative sum of elements in the list `a` adjusted by a cost factor involving `k` and `m`, and tracks the minimum prefix cost to find the optimal result.
