You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n$ and two integers $m$ and $k$.

You can choose some subarray $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{r-1}, a_r$. 

The cost of subarray $a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{r-1}, a_r$ is equal to $\sum\limits_{i=l}^{r} a_i - k \lceil \frac{r - l + 1}{m} \rceil$, where $\lceil x \rceil$ is the least integer greater than or equal to $x$. 

The cost of empty subarray is equal to zero.

For example, if $m = 3$, $k = 10$ and $a = [2, -4, 15, -3, 4, 8, 3]$, then the cost of some subarrays are:  $a_3 \dots a_3: 15 - k \lceil \frac{1}{3} \rceil = 15 - 10 = 5$;  $a_3 \dots a_4: (15 - 3) - k \lceil \frac{2}{3} \rceil = 12 - 10 = 2$;  $a_3 \dots a_5: (15 - 3 + 4) - k \lceil \frac{3}{3} \rceil = 16 - 10 = 6$;  $a_3 \dots a_6: (15 - 3 + 4 + 8) - k \lceil \frac{4}{3} \rceil = 24 - 20 = 4$;  $a_3 \dots a_7: (15 - 3 + 4 + 8 + 3) - k \lceil \frac{5}{3} \rceil = 27 - 20 = 7$. 

Your task is to find the maximum cost of some subarray (possibly empty) of array $a$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10, 1 \le k \le 10^9$).

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the maximum cost of some subarray of array $a$.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 3 10
2 -4 15 -3 4 8 3

Output
7

Input
5 2 1000
-13 -4 -9 -20 -11

Output
0

- Program:
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
a = list(map(int, data[3:]))
print(func_1(n, m, k, a))

def func_1(n, m, k, a):
    max_cost = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_prefix = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_sum += a[i]
        if i + 1 >= m:
            current_cost = current_sum - k * math.ceil((i + 1) / m)
            max_cost = max(max_cost, current_cost - min_prefix)
            min_prefix = min(min_prefix, current_cost)
    return max_cost



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)), `m` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10\)), `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)). It returns `max_cost`, which is the maximum value of `current_sum - k * ceil((i + 1) / m) - min_prefix` over all iterations where `i + 1 >= m`. If `n = 0`, the function returns 0. The function computes the maximum cost based on the cumulative sum of elements in the list `a` adjusted by a cost factor involving `k` and `m`, and tracks the minimum prefix cost to find the optimal result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum (`current_sum`) of the elements. It also keeps track of the minimum prefix cost seen so far (`min_prefix`) to calculate the maximum cost of any subarray that ends at the current index. The key part of the logic is the calculation of `current_cost` which takes into account the penalty for the length of the subarray divided by `m`, rounded up, multiplied by `k`. This approach ensures that the program considers all possible subarrays and correctly applies the cost formula to find the maximum cost.

However, there is a potential issue with the way the program handles the input. The use of `sys.stdin.read` reads the entire input at once, which is split into a list of strings. This method is generally fine for small inputs, but for larger inputs (like those with up to \(3 \times 10^5\) elements), it might lead to performance issues or memory concerns. A more efficient way to handle input would be to read and process it line by line.

Despite this potential issue, the core logic of the program appears to be correct for the given problem statement and should work as expected for valid inputs.
