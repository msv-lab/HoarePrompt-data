 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).

Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.

Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.

We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

The teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.


-----Input-----

The input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 100) — the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.


-----Output-----

If the first team can win, print phrase "Team 1" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase "Team 2" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print "Draw" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 100
100 1
99 99
99 99

Output
Team 1

Input
1 1
2 2
3 3
2 2

Output
Team 2

Input
3 3
2 2
1 1
2 2

Output
Draw



-----Note-----

Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.

Consider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts eight integer parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, `a4`, `b4`, all within the range 1 to 100. It evaluates whether either of two teams (Team 1 or Team 2) can win based on their attack and defense values. Specifically, it returns `True` if Team 1 can successfully attack and defend against both configurations of Team 2's players, and `False` otherwise. The function checks the following conditions:

1. If `team1_defence_1 > team2_attack_1` and `team1_attack_1 > team2_defence_1`, or
2. If `team1_defence_1 > team2_attack_2` and `team1_attack_1 > team2_defence_2`, or
3. If `team1_defence_2 > team2_attack_1` and `team1_attack_2 > team2_defence_1`, or
4. If `team1_defence_2 > team2_attack_2` and `team1_attack_2 > team2_defence_2`.

If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input parameters and maintains their original values throughout its execution.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts eight parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, `a4`, `b4`, each an integer in the range 1 to 100. It evaluates whether Team 2 can successfully attack Team 1 based on the following conditions:

1. If either of the following conditions is met, the function returns `True`:
   - Team 2's Defence 1 (`a3`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 1 (`b2`) and Team 2's Attack 1 (`b4`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 1 (`a1`).
   - Team 2's Defence 1 (`a3`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 2 (`b1`) and Team 2's Attack 1 (`b4`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 2 (`a2`).

2. If neither of the above conditions is met, but either of the following conditions is met, the function returns `True`:
   - Team 2's Defence 2 (`a4`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 1 (`b2`) and Team 2's Attack 2 (`b3`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 1 (`a1`).
   - Team 2's Defence 2 (`a4`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 2 (`b1`) and Team 2's Attack 2 (`b3`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 2 (`a2`).

3. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `False`.

In summary, the function determines if Team 2 can outmaneuver Team 1 in terms of both defence and attack in two possible configurations. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described above.
