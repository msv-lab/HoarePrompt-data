### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` and how they contribute to the overall solution.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if Team 1 can win by evaluating two possible configurations:
  1. Player 1 (with defence `a1` and attack `b2`) vs. Player 3 (with defence `a3` and attack `b4`).
  2. Player 1 (with defence `a1` and attack `b2`) vs. Player 4 (with defence `a4` and attack `b3`).
  3. Player 2 (with defence `a2` and attack `b1`) vs. Player 3 (with defence `a3` and attack `b4`).
  4. Player 2 (with defence `a2` and attack `b1`) vs. Player 4 (with defence `a4` and attack `b3`).

For Team 1 to win, at least one of these configurations must satisfy the condition where:
- Team 1's defence is strictly greater than Team 2's attack.
- Team 1's attack is strictly greater than Team 2's defence.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function checks if Team 2 can win by evaluating two possible configurations:
  1. Player 3 (with defence `a3` and attack `b4`) vs. Player 1 (with defence `a1` and attack `b2`).
  2. Player 3 (with defence `a3` and attack `b4`) vs. Player 2 (with defence `a2` and attack `b1`).
  3. Player 4 (with defence `a4` and attack `b3`) vs. Player 1 (with defence `a1` and attack `b2`).
  4. Player 4 (with defence `a4` and attack `b3`) vs. Player 2 (with defence `a2` and attack `b1`).

For Team 2 to win, at least one of these configurations must satisfy the condition where:
- Team 2's defence is strictly greater than Team 1's attack.
- Team 2's attack is strictly greater than Team 1's defence.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main program calls `func_1` and `func_2` to determine the winning team.
- If `func_1` returns `True` and `func_2` returns `False`, it prints "Team 1".
- If `func_2` returns `True` and `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "Team 2".
- If both `func_1` and `func_2` return `True` or both return `False`, it prints "Draw".

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implements the conditions described in the problem statement.
- The main program correctly uses the results of `func_1` and `func_2` to determine the winning team or if there is a draw.
- The functions handle all possible configurations of player assignments and check the necessary conditions for a team to win.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winning team based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
