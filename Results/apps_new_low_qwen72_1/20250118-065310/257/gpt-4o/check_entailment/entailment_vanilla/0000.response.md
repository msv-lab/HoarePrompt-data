Reasoning: 

The problem requires us to determine which team can guarantee a win based on the optimal choices of defense and attack players. The given functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to check if Team 1 or Team 2 can win, respectively, under the condition that their defense is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and their attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defense.

However, there are a few issues with the provided functions:

1. **Incorrect Assignment of Skills**: In both `func_1` and `func_2`, the assignment of skills to players is inconsistent. For example, in `func_1`, `team1_attack_1` is assigned `b2`, which should be `b1` if the second player is the attacker. Similarly, in `func_2`, `team2_attack_1` is assigned `b4`, which should be `b3` if the fourth player is the attacker. This inconsistency can lead to incorrect comparisons.

2. **Missing Consideration of Optimal Choices**: The problem states that the second team makes their choices after seeing the first team's choices. The current implementation does not account for this strategic element. It simply checks all possible combinations without considering the optimal strategy.

3. **Lack of Draw Condition Handling**: The functions do not explicitly handle the case where neither team can guarantee a win, which should result in a "Draw".

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Ensure the correct assignment of skills.
- Implement a strategy where the second team can react to the first team's choices.
- Check all possible scenarios and determine the outcome.

Given these points, the provided functions are not correct as they do not fully implement the required logic.

Correctness: **False**
