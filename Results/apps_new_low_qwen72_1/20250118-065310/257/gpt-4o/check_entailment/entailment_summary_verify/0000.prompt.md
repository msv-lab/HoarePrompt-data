You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).

Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.

Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.

We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

The teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.


-----Input-----

The input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 100) — the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.


-----Output-----

If the first team can win, print phrase "Team 1" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase "Team 2" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print "Draw" (without the quotes).

-----Note-----

Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.

Consider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4):
    team1_defence_1 = a1
    team1_attack_1 = b2
    team1_defence_2 = a2
    team1_attack_2 = b1
    team2_defence_1 = a3
    team2_attack_1 = b4
    team2_defence_2 = a4
    team2_attack_2 = b3
    if team1_defence_1 > team2_attack_1 and team1_attack_1 > team2_defence_1 or (team1_defence_1 > team2_attack_2 and team1_attack_1 > team2_defence_2):
        return True
    if team1_defence_2 > team2_attack_1 and team1_attack_2 > team2_defence_1 or (team1_defence_2 > team2_attack_2 and team1_attack_2 > team2_defence_2):
        return True
    return False

#Function 2:
def func_2(a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4):
    team1_defence_1 = a1
    team1_attack_1 = b2
    team1_defence_2 = a2
    team1_attack_2 = b1
    team2_defence_1 = a3
    team2_attack_1 = b4
    team2_defence_2 = a4
    team2_attack_2 = b3
    if team2_defence_1 > team1_attack_1 and team2_attack_1 > team1_defence_1 or (team2_defence_1 > team1_attack_2 and team2_attack_1 > team1_defence_2):
        return True
    if team2_defence_2 > team1_attack_1 and team2_attack_2 > team1_defence_1 or (team2_defence_2 > team1_attack_2 and team2_attack_2 > team1_defence_2):
        return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts eight parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, `a4`, `b4`, each an integer in the range 1 to 100. It evaluates whether Team 2 can successfully attack Team 1 based on the following conditions:

1. If either of the following conditions is met, the function returns `True`:
   - Team 2's Defence 1 (`a3`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 1 (`b2`) and Team 2's Attack 1 (`b4`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 1 (`a1`).
   - Team 2's Defence 1 (`a3`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 2 (`b1`) and Team 2's Attack 1 (`b4`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 2 (`a2`).

2. If neither of the above conditions is met, but either of the following conditions is met, the function returns `True`:
   - Team 2's Defence 2 (`a4`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 1 (`b2`) and Team 2's Attack 2 (`b3`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 1 (`a1`).
   - Team 2's Defence 2 (`a4`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 2 (`b1`) and Team 2's Attack 2 (`b3`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 2 (`a2`).

3. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `False`.

In summary, the function determines if Team 2 can outmaneuver Team 1 in terms of both defence and attack in two possible configurations. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described above.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to check if Team 1 or Team 2 can win, respectively, but they do not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, the functions do not account for the optimal strategy of the second team after observing the first team's choices. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
a1 = 50, b1 = 50
a2 = 50, b2 = 50
a3 = 60, b3 = 40
a4 = 40, b4 = 60
```

In this case:
- The first team has equal defence and attack skills for both players.
- The second team has a clear advantage in one skill for each player.

The optimal strategy for the first team could be:
- Player 1 (50, 50) plays defence.
- Player 2 (50, 50) plays attack.

The second team can then counter with:
- Player 3 (60, 40) plays defence.
- Player 4 (40, 60) plays attack.

In this scenario, the second team's defence (60) is greater than the first team's attack (50), and the second team's attack (60) is greater than the first team's defence (50). Therefore, the second team can win. However, the provided functions do not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible arrangements of players and their skills, and then determine the optimal strategy for both teams. The current implementation does not do this, hence it is incorrect.
