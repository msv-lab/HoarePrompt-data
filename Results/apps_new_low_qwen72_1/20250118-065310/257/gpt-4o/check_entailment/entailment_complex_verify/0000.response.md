### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if either Team 1 or Team 2 can guarantee a win based on their players' defence and attack skills.
   - Each team must choose one player for defence and one for attack, and the second team makes their choice after observing the first team's choice.
   - A team wins if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **`func_1`** checks if Team 1 can win by evaluating all possible configurations of players for both teams.
   - **`func_2`** checks if Team 2 can win by evaluating all possible configurations of players for both teams.
   - Both functions return `True` if the respective team can win and `False` otherwise.

3. **Evaluating the Functions:**
   - The functions correctly set up the defence and attack values for both teams.
   - The conditions inside the functions are designed to check if one team's defence is greater than the other team's attack and vice versa.
   - The functions consider all possible pairings of players for both teams, ensuring that all scenarios are evaluated.

4. **Checking the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the functions do not handle all possible scenarios correctly, specifically the optimal strategy of the second team after observing the first team's choices.
   - However, upon closer inspection, the functions do indeed consider all possible configurations of players for both teams. The conditions inside the functions are comprehensive and cover all necessary comparisons.

5. **Counterexample Analysis:**
   - The provided counterexample:
     ```
     a1 = 50, b1 = 50
     a2 = 50, b2 = 50
     a3 = 60, b3 = 40
     a4 = 40, b4 = 60
     ```
   - In this case, the first team can choose:
     - Player 1 (50, 50) for defence.
     - Player 2 (50, 50) for attack.
   - The second team can then choose:
     - Player 3 (60, 40) for defence.
     - Player 4 (40, 60) for attack.
   - The second team's defence (60) is greater than the first team's attack (50), and the second team's attack (60) is greater than the first team's defence (50). Therefore, the second team can win.
   - The functions correctly identify this scenario and return the appropriate results.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle all possible scenarios and correctly evaluate the optimal strategies for both teams.
   - The original assessment's claim that the functions do not handle all possible scenarios correctly is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
