Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Assignment of Skills**:
   - In `func_1`, the assignments are:
     - `team1_defence_1 = a1` (correct)
     - `team1_attack_1 = b2` (incorrect, should be `b1`)
     - `team1_defence_2 = a2` (correct)
     - `team1_attack_2 = b1` (correct)
     - `team2_defence_1 = a3` (correct)
     - `team2_attack_1 = b4` (incorrect, should be `b3`)
     - `team2_defence_2 = a4` (correct)
     - `team2_attack_2 = b3` (correct)
   - In `func_2`, the assignments are:
     - `team1_defence_1 = a1` (correct)
     - `team1_attack_1 = b2` (incorrect, should be `b1`)
     - `team1_defence_2 = a2` (correct)
     - `team1_attack_2 = b1` (correct)
     - `team2_defence_1 = a3` (correct)
     - `team2_attack_1 = b4` (incorrect, should be `b3`)
     - `team2_defence_2 = a4` (correct)
     - `team2_attack_2 = b3` (correct)

   These incorrect assignments can lead to invalid comparisons and incorrect results.

2. **Missing Consideration of Optimal Choices**:
   - The problem specifies that the second team makes their choices after seeing the first team's choices. The current implementation does not account for this strategic element. It simply checks all possible combinations without considering the optimal strategy.

3. **Lack of Draw Condition Handling**:
   - The functions do not explicitly handle the case where neither team can guarantee a win, which should result in a "Draw".

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Ensure the correct assignment of skills.
- Implement a strategy where the second team can react to the first team's choices.
- Check all possible scenarios and determine the outcome.

Given these points, the provided functions are indeed incorrect as they do not fully implement the required logic.

Final: **False**
