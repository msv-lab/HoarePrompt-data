Reasoning: The original assessment identifies a critical flaw in the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2`. These functions do not adequately account for the optimal strategies of both teams, particularly the second team's response to the first team's choices. The provided example demonstrates a scenario where the second team can counter the first team's strategy, but the functions fail to capture this correctly.

The core issue is that the functions only check specific combinations of players and their roles without considering all possible optimal arrangements. For instance, the functions assume fixed roles for players within each team and do not explore all permutations of who plays defence and who plays attack. This limitation means that the program might miss scenarios where a team can win by rearranging its players differently.

The original assessment correctly points out that the functions do not handle all possible scenarios and thus are incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
