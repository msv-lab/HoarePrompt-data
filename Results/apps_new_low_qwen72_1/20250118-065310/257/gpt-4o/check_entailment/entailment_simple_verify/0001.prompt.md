You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).

Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.

Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.

We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

The teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.


-----Input-----

The input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 100) — the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.


-----Output-----

If the first team can win, print phrase "Team 1" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase "Team 2" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print "Draw" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 100
100 1
99 99
99 99

Output

1 1

-----Note-----

Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.

Consider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 

The problem requires us to determine which team can guarantee a win based on the optimal choices of defense and attack players. The given functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to check if Team 1 or Team 2 can win, respectively, under the condition that their defense is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and their attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defense.

However, there are a few issues with the provided functions:

1. **Incorrect Assignment of Skills**: In both `func_1` and `func_2`, the assignment of skills to players is inconsistent. For example, in `func_1`, `team1_attack_1` is assigned `b2`, which should be `b1` if the second player is the attacker. Similarly, in `func_2`, `team2_attack_1` is assigned `b4`, which should be `b3` if the fourth player is the attacker. This inconsistency can lead to incorrect comparisons.

2. **Missing Consideration of Optimal Choices**: The problem states that the second team makes their choices after seeing the first team's choices. The current implementation does not account for this strategic element. It simply checks all possible combinations without considering the optimal strategy.

3. **Lack of Draw Condition Handling**: The functions do not explicitly handle the case where neither team can guarantee a win, which should result in a "Draw".

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Ensure the correct assignment of skills.
- Implement a strategy where the second team can react to the first team's choices.
- Check all possible scenarios and determine the outcome.

Given these points, the provided functions are not correct as they do not fully implement the required logic.

Correctness: **False**
