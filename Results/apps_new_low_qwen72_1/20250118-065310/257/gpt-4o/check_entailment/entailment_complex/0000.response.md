Reasoning:
The provided program consists of two main functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are designed to evaluate the potential outcomes of a Kicker (table football) match between two teams. The correctness of the program depends on whether these functions correctly implement the logic required to determine if one team can guarantee a win over the other.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Determines if Team 1 can win.
- **Logic**:
  - The function considers all possible configurations of Team 1's players (two possible pairs of defence and attack players).
  - For each configuration, it checks if Team 1's defence is greater than Team 2's attack and Team 1's attack is greater than Team 2's defence.
  - If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that Team 1 can win.
  - If none of the conditions are met, the function returns `False`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Determines if Team 2 can win.
- **Logic**:
  - The function considers all possible configurations of Team 2's players (two possible pairs of defence and attack players).
  - For each configuration, it checks if Team 2's defence is greater than Team 1's attack and Team 2's attack is greater than Team 1's defence.
  - If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that Team 2 can win.
  - If none of the conditions are met, the function returns `False`.

### Main Program Logic:
- **Flow**:
  - The main program reads the input values for the players' skills.
  - It calls `func_1` to check if Team 1 can win.
  - It calls `func_2` to check if Team 2 can win.
  - Based on the results of these functions, it prints "Team 1", "Team 2", or "Draw".

### Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `1 100\n100 1\n99 99\n99 99`
  - Expected Output: "Team 1"
  - Explanation: Team 1 can assign Player 1 to defence and Player 2 to attack. This gives Team 1 a defence of 1 and an attack of 100. Team 2 cannot match this configuration, so Team 1 wins.
- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n2 2`
  - Expected Output: "Team 2"
  - Explanation: Team 2 can assign Player 3 to defence and Player 4 to attack. This gives Team 2 a defence of 3 and an attack of 2. Team 1 cannot match this configuration, so Team 2 wins.
- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3 3\n2 2\n1 1\n2 2`
  - Expected Output: "Draw"
  - Explanation: Neither team can guarantee a win because both teams have configurations that can be matched by the other team.

### Conclusion:
The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to determine if one team can guarantee a win over the other. The main program correctly uses these functions to determine the outcome and prints the appropriate result.

Correctness: **True**
