Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to check if Team 1 or Team 2 can win, respectively, but they do not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, the functions do not account for the optimal strategy of the second team after observing the first team's choices. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
a1 = 50, b1 = 50
a2 = 50, b2 = 50
a3 = 60, b3 = 40
a4 = 40, b4 = 60
```

In this case:
- The first team has equal defence and attack skills for both players.
- The second team has a clear advantage in one skill for each player.

The optimal strategy for the first team could be:
- Player 1 (50, 50) plays defence.
- Player 2 (50, 50) plays attack.

The second team can then counter with:
- Player 3 (60, 40) plays defence.
- Player 4 (40, 60) plays attack.

In this scenario, the second team's defence (60) is greater than the first team's attack (50), and the second team's attack (60) is greater than the first team's defence (50). Therefore, the second team can win. However, the provided functions do not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible arrangements of players and their skills, and then determine the optimal strategy for both teams. The current implementation does not do this, hence it is incorrect.
