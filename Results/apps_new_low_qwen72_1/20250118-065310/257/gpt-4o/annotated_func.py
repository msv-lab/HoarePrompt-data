#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts eight integer parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, `a4`, `b4`, all within the range 1 to 100. It evaluates whether either of two teams (Team 1 or Team 2) can win based on their attack and defense values. Specifically, it returns `True` if Team 1 can successfully attack and defend against both configurations of Team 2's players, and `False` otherwise. The function checks the following conditions:

1. If `team1_defence_1 > team2_attack_1` and `team1_attack_1 > team2_defence_1`, or
2. If `team1_defence_1 > team2_attack_2` and `team1_attack_1 > team2_defence_2`, or
3. If `team1_defence_2 > team2_attack_1` and `team1_attack_2 > team2_defence_1`, or
4. If `team1_defence_2 > team2_attack_2` and `team1_attack_2 > team2_defence_2`.

If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input parameters and maintains their original values throughout its execution.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts eight parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, `a4`, `b4`, each an integer in the range 1 to 100. It evaluates whether Team 2 can successfully attack Team 1 based on the following conditions:

1. If either of the following conditions is met, the function returns `True`:
   - Team 2's Defence 1 (`a3`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 1 (`b2`) and Team 2's Attack 1 (`b4`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 1 (`a1`).
   - Team 2's Defence 1 (`a3`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 2 (`b1`) and Team 2's Attack 1 (`b4`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 2 (`a2`).

2. If neither of the above conditions is met, but either of the following conditions is met, the function returns `True`:
   - Team 2's Defence 2 (`a4`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 1 (`b2`) and Team 2's Attack 2 (`b3`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 1 (`a1`).
   - Team 2's Defence 2 (`a4`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 2 (`b1`) and Team 2's Attack 2 (`b3`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 2 (`a2`).

3. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `False`.

In summary, the function determines if Team 2 can outmaneuver Team 1 in terms of both defence and attack in two possible configurations. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described above.
