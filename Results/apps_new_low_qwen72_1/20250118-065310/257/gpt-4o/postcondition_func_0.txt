The function `func_1` accepts eight integer parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, `a4`, `b4`, all within the range 1 to 100. It evaluates whether either of two teams (Team 1 or Team 2) can win based on their attack and defense values. Specifically, it returns `True` if Team 1 can successfully attack and defend against both configurations of Team 2's players, and `False` otherwise. The function checks the following conditions:

1. If `team1_defence_1 > team2_attack_1` and `team1_attack_1 > team2_defence_1`, or
2. If `team1_defence_1 > team2_attack_2` and `team1_attack_1 > team2_defence_2`, or
3. If `team1_defence_2 > team2_attack_1` and `team1_attack_2 > team2_defence_1`, or
4. If `team1_defence_2 > team2_attack_2` and `team1_attack_2 > team2_defence_2`.

If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input parameters and maintains their original values throughout its execution.
