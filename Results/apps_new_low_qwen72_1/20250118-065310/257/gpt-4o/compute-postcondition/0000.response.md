The provided code assigns values from the initial variables `a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4` to new variables representing the defense and attack values of two teams. Each team has two players, and their defense and attack values are assigned based on the initial variables. The code does not perform any operations that modify the initial variables, so they retain their original values.

Output State: **a1 is an integer (1 ≤ a1 ≤ 100), b1 is an integer (1 ≤ b1 ≤ 100), a2 is an integer (1 ≤ a2 ≤ 100), b2 is an integer (1 ≤ b2 ≤ 100), a3 is an integer (1 ≤ a3 ≤ 100), b3 is an integer (1 ≤ b3 ≤ 100), a4 is an integer (1 ≤ a4 ≤ 100), b4 is an integer (1 ≤ b4 ≤ 100), team1_defence_1 is a1, team1_attack_1 is b2, team1_defence_2 is a2, team1_attack_2 is b1, team2_defence_1 is a3, team2_attack_1 is b4, team2_defence_2 is a4, team2_attack_2 is b3**
