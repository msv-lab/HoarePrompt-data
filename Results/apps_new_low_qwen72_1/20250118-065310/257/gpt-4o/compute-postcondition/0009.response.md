Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts eight parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, `a4`, `b4`, each an integer in the range 1 to 100. It evaluates whether Team 2 can successfully attack Team 1 based on the following conditions:

1. If either of the following conditions is met, the function returns `True`:
   - Team 2's Defence 1 (`a3`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 1 (`b2`) and Team 2's Attack 1 (`b4`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 1 (`a1`).
   - Team 2's Defence 1 (`a3`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 2 (`b1`) and Team 2's Attack 1 (`b4`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 2 (`a2`).

2. If neither of the above conditions is met, but either of the following conditions is met, the function returns `True`:
   - Team 2's Defence 2 (`a4`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 1 (`b2`) and Team 2's Attack 2 (`b3`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 1 (`a1`).
   - Team 2's Defence 2 (`a4`) is greater than Team 1's Attack 2 (`b1`) and Team 2's Attack 2 (`b3`) is greater than Team 1's Defence 2 (`a2`).

3. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `False`.

In summary, the function determines if Team 2 can outmaneuver Team 1 in terms of both defence and attack in two possible configurations. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described above. **
