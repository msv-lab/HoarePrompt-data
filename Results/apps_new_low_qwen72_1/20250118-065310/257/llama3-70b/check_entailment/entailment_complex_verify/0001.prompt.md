You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).

Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.

Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.

We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

The teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.


-----Input-----

The input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 100) — the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.


-----Output-----

If the first team can win, print phrase "Team 1" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase "Team 2" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print "Draw" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 100
100 1
99 99
99 99

Output
Team 1

Input
1 1
2 2
3 3
2 2

Output
Team 2

3 3
2 2
1 1
2 2

Output
Draw



-----Note-----

Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.

Consider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of four lists, each containing two integers a_i and b_i where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 100, representing the defence and attack skills of the i-th player, respectively.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the defence and attack skills of four players, each represented by two integers between 1 and 100. It then determines the strongest defence and attack skills within two teams of two players each. Based on these values, it prints 'Team 1' if Team 1's strongest defence is greater than Team 2's strongest attack and Team 1's strongest attack is greater than Team 2's strongest defence. It prints 'Team 2' if Team 2's strongest defence is greater than Team 1's strongest attack and Team 2's strongest attack is greater than Team 1's strongest defence. If neither condition is met, it prints 'Draw'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program reads the defense and attack skills for four players, corresponding to two teams. It calculates the maximum defense and attack values for each team based on the assumption that each team will select their best player for each role (defense or attack). It then compares these values to determine if one team can guarantee a win over the other according to the rules specified (one team's defense must be strictly greater than the other's attack, and vice versa for attack).

However, the program does not fully account for the fact that the second team can make their decisions after seeing the first team's choices. The logic should consider all possible combinations of player assignments within each team and then check if there is any assignment that allows one team to guarantee a win.

Given the current logic, the program only checks the best-case scenario for each team independently, without considering the strategic advantage of the second team making an informed decision after the first team has chosen. This oversight could lead to incorrect conclusions in scenarios where the second team can counter the first team's optimal strategy.
