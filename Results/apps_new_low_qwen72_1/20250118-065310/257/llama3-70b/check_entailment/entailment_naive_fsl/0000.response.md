Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution assumes that the best strategy for each team is to always assign the player with the highest defense skill to defense and the player with the highest attack skill to attack. However, this assumption may not always lead to the optimal outcome, especially when considering the dynamic where the second team can react to the first team's choices.

A counterexample to illustrate this issue:

Input:
```
1 100
100 1
99 98
98 99
```

In this case, the first team has:
- Player 1: Defence = 1, Attack = 100
- Player 2: Defence = 100, Attack = 1

The second team has:
- Player 3: Defence = 99, Attack = 98
- Player 4: Defence = 98, Attack = 99

The program will output:
```
Draw
```

However, if the first team assigns Player 2 to defense and Player 1 to attack, the configuration would be:
- Team 1: Defence = 100, Attack = 100
- Team 2: Defence = 99, Attack = 99

In this configuration, Team 1 would win because:
- Team 1's defense (100) > Team 2's attack (99)
- Team 1's attack (100) > Team 2's defense (99)

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect result in some scenarios.
