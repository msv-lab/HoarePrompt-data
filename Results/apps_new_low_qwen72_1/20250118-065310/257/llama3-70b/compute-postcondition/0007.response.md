The code snippet provided only includes a print statement, which outputs the string 'Draw' to the console. This does not alter any of the variables or conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, all the conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4 are integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 100, team1_defence is max(a1, a2), team1_attack is max(b1, b2), team2_defence is max(a3, a4), team2_attack is max(b3, b4. Either team1_defence ≤ team2_attack or team1_attack ≤ team2_defence, and either team2_defence ≤ team1_attack or team2_attack ≤ team1_defence. 'Draw' is printed.**
