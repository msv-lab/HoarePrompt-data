Postcondition: ***a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4 are integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 100, team1_defence is max(a1, a2), team1_attack is max(b1, b2), team2_defence is max(a3, a4), team2_attack is max(b3, b4). If team2_defence > team1_attack and team2_attack > team1_defence, 'Team 2' is printed. Otherwise, either team1_defence ≤ team2_attack or team1_attack ≤ team2_defence, and either team2_defence ≤ team1_attack or team2_attack ≤ team1_defence, and 'Draw' is printed.***
