The code snippet reads four pairs of integers from the input, each pair representing the defence and attack skills of a player. It then calculates the maximum defence and attack skills for two teams, each composed of two players.

- `a1, b1` are the defence and attack skills of the first player.
- `a2, b2` are the defence and attack skills of the second player.
- `a3, b3` are the defence and attack skills of the third player.
- `a4, b4` are the defence and attack skills of the fourth player.

The maximum defence and attack skills for each team are calculated as follows:
- `team1_defence` is the maximum of `a1` and `a2`.
- `team1_attack` is the maximum of `b1` and `b2`.
- `team2_defence` is the maximum of `a3` and `a4`.
- `team2_attack` is the maximum of `b3` and `b4`.

Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4 are integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 100, team1_defence is max(a1, a2), team1_attack is max(b1, b2), team2_defence is max(a3, a4), team2_attack is max(b3, b4)**
