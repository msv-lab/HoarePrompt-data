Functionality: ** The function reads the defence and attack skills of four players, each represented by two integers between 1 and 100. It then determines the strongest defence and attack skills within two teams of two players each. Based on these values, it prints 'Team 1' if Team 1's strongest defence is greater than Team 2's strongest attack and Team 1's strongest attack is greater than Team 2's strongest defence. It prints 'Team 2' if Team 2's strongest defence is greater than Team 1's strongest attack and Team 2's strongest attack is greater than Team 1's strongest defence. If neither condition is met, it prints 'Draw'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input will always be valid (i.e., four lines of input, each containing two integers between 1 and 100). If the input deviates from this format, the function will raise an error.
- The function does not handle cases where the input might be invalid or out of the specified range.
- The function does not provide any feedback or error messages if the input is incorrect, which could lead to confusion for the user.
