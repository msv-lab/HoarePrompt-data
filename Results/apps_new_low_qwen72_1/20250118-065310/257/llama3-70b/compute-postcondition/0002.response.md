The code snippet `print('Team 1')` prints the string 'Team 1' to the console. This operation does not alter any of the variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the print action.

Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4 are integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 100, team1_defence is max(a1, a2), team1_attack is max(b1, b2), team2_defence is max(a3, a4), team2_attack is max(b3, b4). The current value of team1_defence is greater than the current value of team2_attack, and the current value of team1_attack is greater than the current value of team2_defence. 'Team 1' has been printed.**
