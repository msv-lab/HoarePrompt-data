Postcondition: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4 are integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 100, team1_defence is max(a1, a2), team1_attack is max(b1, b2), team2_defence is max(a3, a4), team2_attack is max(b3, b4). The current value of team1_defence is greater than the current value of team2_attack, and the current value of team1_attack is greater than the current value of team2_defence.**
