You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).

Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th player is a_{i}, the attack skill is b_{i}.

Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.

We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

The teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.


-----Input-----

The input contain the players' description in four lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 100) — the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player, correspondingly.


-----Output-----

If the first team can win, print phrase "Team 1" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase "Team 2" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print "Draw" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 100
100 1
99 99
99 99

Output
Team 1

Input
1 1
2 2
3 3
2 2

Output
Team 2

Input
3 3
2 2
1 1
2 2

Output
Draw



-----Note-----

Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.

Consider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).
