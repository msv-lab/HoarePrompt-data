The function reads the defence and attack skills of four players, each represented by two integers between 1 and 100. It then determines the strongest defence and attack skills within two teams of two players each. Based on these values, it prints 'Team 1' if Team 1's strongest defence is greater than Team 2's strongest attack and Team 1's strongest attack is greater than Team 2's strongest defence. It prints 'Team 2' if Team 2's strongest defence is greater than Team 1's strongest attack and Team 2's strongest attack is greater than Team 1's strongest defence. If neither condition is met, it prints 'Draw'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console.
