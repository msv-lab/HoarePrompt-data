The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the input, where \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). It then constructs a set `towers` that contains even numbers up to \(2n\) and multiples of 3 up to \(3m\). Finally, the function prints the maximum value in the `towers` set. If either `n` or `m` is zero, the corresponding loop will not add any elements to the set, but the function will still print the maximum value from the non-empty part of the set. If both `n` and `m` are zero, the function will not execute due to the condition \(n + m > 0\).
