Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000 and n + m > 0.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq 1,000,000\), `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}, `i` is `n`.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq 1,000,000\), `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, 3, 6, 9, ..., 3m}, `i` is `n`. The loop executes if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `towers` remains {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}.
    print(max(towers))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the input, where \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). It then constructs a set `towers` that contains even numbers up to \(2n\) and multiples of 3 up to \(3m\). Finally, the function prints the maximum value in the `towers` set. If either `n` or `m` is zero, the corresponding loop will not add any elements to the set, but the function will still print the maximum value from the non-empty part of the set. If both `n` and `m` are zero, the function will not execute due to the condition \(n + m > 0\).
