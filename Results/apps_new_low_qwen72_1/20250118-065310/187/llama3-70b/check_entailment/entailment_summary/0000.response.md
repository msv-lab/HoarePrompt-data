Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum height necessary for the tallest tower by ensuring that each student's tower has a unique height. It uses a set to store the heights of all towers, which automatically handles the uniqueness requirement. The program then prints the maximum height found in the set, which represents the height of the tallest tower. However, there is one subtle issue: the program does not explicitly handle the case where a specific height could be used by both groups of students (those using 2-block pieces and those using 3-block pieces). Despite this, the program still works correctly because the set data structure ensures that duplicate heights are not added, and the maximum height is still accurately determined.

The provided examples and the execution summary confirm that the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
