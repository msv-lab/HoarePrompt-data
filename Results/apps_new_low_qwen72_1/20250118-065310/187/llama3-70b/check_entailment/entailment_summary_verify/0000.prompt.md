You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the input, where \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). It then constructs a set `towers` that contains even numbers up to \(2n\) and multiples of 3 up to \(3m\). Finally, the function prints the maximum value in the `towers` set. If either `n` or `m` is zero, the corresponding loop will not add any elements to the set, but the function will still print the maximum value from the non-empty part of the set. If both `n` and `m` are zero, the function will not execute due to the condition \(n + m > 0\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively.

2. **Set Initialization**: It initializes an empty set `towers` to store the unique heights of the towers.

3. **Adding Heights for Two-Block Pieces**: It iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and adds each multiple of 2 to the `towers` set. This ensures that all possible heights for towers made by students using two-block pieces are included.

4. **Adding Heights for Three-Block Pieces**: Similarly, it iterates over the range from 1 to `m` (inclusive) and adds each multiple of 3 to the `towers` set. This ensures that all possible heights for towers made by students using three-block pieces are included.

5. **Finding the Maximum Height**: Finally, it finds the maximum value in the `towers` set and prints it. This value represents the minimum possible height of the tallest tower, ensuring that no two students have towers of the same height.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description:
- When `n` or `m` is zero, it still works correctly by only considering the non-zero values.
- The use of a set ensures that all heights are unique.
- The program efficiently finds the maximum height without unnecessary computations.

Given these points, the program is correct for all potential cases.
