You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000 and n + m > 0.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq 1,000,000\), `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}, `i` is `n`.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq 1,000,000\), `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, 3, 6, 9, ..., 3m}, `i` is `n`. The loop executes if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `towers` remains {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}.
    print(max(towers))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by collecting all the possible heights of towers that can be built by the students in a set called `towers`. It iterates through the number of students using two-block pieces and adds the corresponding tower heights (multiples of 2) to the set. Similarly, it iterates through the number of students using three-block pieces and adds the corresponding tower heights (multiples of 3) to the set. Finally, it prints the maximum value from the set, which represents the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.

However, there is a critical oversight in the logic of the program. The problem specifies that no two students' towers may contain the same number of blocks, but the program does not ensure this condition. By simply adding multiples of 2 and 3 to the set, the program does not account for the fact that some heights might be repeated and thus need to be adjusted to maintain uniqueness.

For example, if `n = 1` and `m = 3`, the program will add the following heights to the set:
- For `n = 1`: 2
- For `m = 3`: 3, 6, 9

This results in the set `{2, 3, 6, 9}`, and the program outputs `9`. However, the correct solution should ensure that the heights are unique, which means adjusting the heights if necessary. In this case, the correct heights could be 2, 3, 4, and 6, leading to a maximum height of 6, not 9.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly handle the requirement for unique tower heights and is thus incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
