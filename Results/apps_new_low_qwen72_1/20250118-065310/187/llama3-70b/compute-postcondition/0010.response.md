The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `m` must still satisfy \(1 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq 1,000,000\), `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, 3}, `i` is 2**
