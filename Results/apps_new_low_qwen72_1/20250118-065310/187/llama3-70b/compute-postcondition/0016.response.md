The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are non-negative integers with the constraints 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0. The function's return value is not specified in the given information, but based on typical function behavior and the constraints provided, it is expected to perform some operation or computation using `n` and `m` and return a result accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both non-negative integers where 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
