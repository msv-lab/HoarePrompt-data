The provided code snippet initializes the variables `n` and `m` by reading two integers from the input, and it also initializes an empty set named `towers`.

- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers with the constraints 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
- The first line of the code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`.
- The second line initializes an empty set called `towers`.

Since the values of `n` and `m` are read from the input, they can now be any non-negative integers within the specified range, and their sum must be greater than zero. The `towers` set remains empty after the execution of the code.

Output State: **n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0, towers is an empty set**
