Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq 1,000,000\), `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, 3, 6, 9, ..., 3m}, `i` is `n`. The loop executes if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `towers` remains {2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}.**
