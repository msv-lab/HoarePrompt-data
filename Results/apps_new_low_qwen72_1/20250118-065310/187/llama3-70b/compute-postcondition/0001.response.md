To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\).
- `towers` is an empty set.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n + 1`. This means the loop will execute if and only if the range is not empty.
3. **Condition for Non-Empty Range**: For the range to be non-empty, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `m` does not directly affect the loop execution, but it must still satisfy the given constraints. The variable `i` will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), `towers` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
