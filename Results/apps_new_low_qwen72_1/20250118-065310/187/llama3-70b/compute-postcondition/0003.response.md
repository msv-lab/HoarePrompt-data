To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the current state:

### Current State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\)
- `towers` is a set containing {2}
- `i` is 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, exclusive of `n + 1`.
2. The loop condition is `i < n + 1`.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < n + 1` must still hold true.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The condition `i < n + 1` must still hold true. Since `i` is now 2, `n + 1` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` remains a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\)
- `towers` remains a set containing {2}
- `i` is 2

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), `towers` is a set containing {2}, `i` is 2**
