Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads four integers from the input, which represent the coordinates of two trees.
2. **Coordinate Calculation**:
   - If the x-coordinates (`x1` and `x2`) are the same, the program calculates the y-coordinates of the other two trees by adding and subtracting the absolute difference of the y-coordinates.
   - If the x-coordinates are different, the program calculates the y-coordinates of the other two trees by adding and subtracting the absolute difference of the x-coordinates.
3. **Range Check**: The program checks if the calculated coordinates are within the range [-1000, 1000]. If they are, it prints the coordinates; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program step-by-step:

- **Case 1: \( x1 = x2 \)**
  - This means the two given points lie on a vertical line.
  - The other two points should be horizontally aligned with the given points, forming a square.
  - The program correctly calculates the x-coordinates of the other two points as `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)` and `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, and keeps the y-coordinates as `y1` and `y2`.

- **Case 2: \( x1 \neq x2 \)**
  - This means the two given points lie on a horizontal line or a diagonal line.
  - The other two points should be vertically aligned with the given points, forming a square.
  - The program correctly calculates the y-coordinates of the other two points as `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)` and `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`, and keeps the x-coordinates as `x1` and `x2`.

- **Range Check**:
  - The program ensures that the calculated coordinates are within the range [-1000, 1000].
  - This is necessary because the problem statement specifies that the coordinates must be within this range.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all the cases and performs the necessary calculations and checks.

Correctness: **True**
