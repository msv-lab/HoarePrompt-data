Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program's logic. The program assumes that the two given points form a side of the square (i.e., they share either the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate). However, the problem statement does not restrict the input to only those cases; the points can also form a diagonal of the square.

Let's break down the program's behavior:

1. **Case 1: Points form a side (same x or y coordinate):**
   - If `x1 == x2`, the program calculates `x3` and `x4` as `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)` and `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, respectively, and sets `y3` and `y4` to `y1` and `y2`, respectively.
   - If `y1 == y2`, the program calculates `y3` and `y4` as `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)` and `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`, respectively, and sets `x3` and `x4` to `x1` and `x2`, respectively.

2. **Case 2: Points form a diagonal:**
   - The program does not handle this case. For example, with the input `0 0 1 1`, the points form a diagonal, and the correct output should be `0 1 1 0`. However, the program will output `-1` because it does not recognize this configuration and incorrectly assumes the points form a side.

The program's logic is incomplete and fails to handle the diagonal case, which is a valid input according to the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
