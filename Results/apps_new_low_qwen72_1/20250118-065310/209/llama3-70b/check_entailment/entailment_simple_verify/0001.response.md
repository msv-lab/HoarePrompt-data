Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program's logic when the two given points form a diagonal of the square rather than an edge. Specifically, the program fails to recognize and handle the diagonal case, leading to incorrect results for inputs like `0 0 1 2`.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling Diagonal Case**: The program only considers the cases where the two given points form either a vertical or horizontal edge of the square. It does not account for the possibility that the points might form a diagonal. For example, if the input is `0 0 1 1`, the correct output should be `0 1 1 0`, but the program does not handle this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Coordinates**: When the points form a diagonal, the program incorrectly calculates the positions of the other two vertices. For instance, with the input `0 0 1 2`, the program outputs `-1` because it incorrectly assumes the points form an edge, leading to invalid coordinates.

3. **Range Check**: The program correctly checks if the calculated coordinates fall within the specified range. However, this check alone does not address the logical error in handling diagonals.

To fix the program, we need to add a check to determine if the given points form a diagonal and then calculate the coordinates of the other two vertices accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    dx = abs(x1 - x2)
    dy = abs(y1 - y2)
    
    # Check if the points form a diagonal
    if dx == dy:
        x3, y3 = x1 - dy, y1 + dx
        x4, y4 = x2 - dy, y2 + dx
    else:
        # Points form an edge
        if x1 == x2:
            x3, x4 = x1 + dy, x1 - dy
            y3, y4 = y1, y2
        else:
            y3, y4 = y1 + dx, y1 - dx
            x3, x4 = x1, x2
    
    # Check if the coordinates are within the valid range
    if (-1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y4 <= 1000):
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

Given the above reasoning and the provided examples, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the diagonal case correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

Final: **False**
