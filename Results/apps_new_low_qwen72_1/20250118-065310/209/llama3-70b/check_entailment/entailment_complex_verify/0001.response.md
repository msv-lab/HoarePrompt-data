Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program's logic. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the two given points form a diagonal of the square. This is a significant oversight because, in a square, the diagonals are also of equal length, and the program should be able to correctly determine the other two vertices in such a scenario.

Let's break down the program's behavior using the annotated version:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads four integers `x1, y1, x2, y2` from the input, representing the coordinates of the two given points.

2. **Vertical Edge Case:**
   - If `x1 == x2`, the program assumes the points form a vertical edge of the square.
   - It calculates the other two vertices as `(x1 + abs(y1 - y2), y1)` and `(x1 - abs(y1 - y2), y2)`.

3. **Horizontal Edge Case:**
   - If `x1 != x2`, the program assumes the points form a horizontal edge of the square.
   - It calculates the other two vertices as `(x1, y1 + abs(x1 - x2))` and `(x2, y1 - abs(x1 - x2))`.

4. **Range Check:**
   - The program checks if the calculated coordinates `x3, y3, x4, y4` fall within the range `[-1000, 1000]`.
   - If they do, it prints them; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

5. **Diagonal Case:**
   - The program does not handle the diagonal case, where the distance between the two points is equal to the side length of the square.
   - For example, if the input is `0 0 1 1`, the program should recognize this as a diagonal and calculate the correct vertices as `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`.
   - However, the program incorrectly treats this as a non-square configuration and prints `-1`.

The original assessment is correct in pointing out this flaw. The program's logic is incomplete and does not account for all possible configurations of the points, specifically the diagonal case.

Final: **False**
