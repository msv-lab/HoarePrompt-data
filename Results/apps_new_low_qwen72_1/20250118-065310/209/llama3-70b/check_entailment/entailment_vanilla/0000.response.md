Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the coordinates of the two missing vertices of a square given two of its vertices. The logic hinges on the properties of squares and their coordinates. If the x-coordinates of the two given points are the same, it implies they form a vertical edge of the square. Similarly, if the y-coordinates are the same, it implies they form a horizontal edge of the square. For both cases, the side length of the square is derived from the absolute difference between the y-coordinates or x-coordinates, respectively. The program then calculates the possible coordinates for the other two vertices and checks if they fall within the specified range.

However, there is a flaw in the program's logic when handling the case where the two given points do not form an edge of the square but rather a diagonal. In such a scenario, the program will incorrectly calculate the positions of the other two vertices, leading to an incorrect solution. This is because the current logic assumes that the two given points are adjacent vertices, which is not always the case.

For example, if the input is `0 0 1 1`, the program should correctly identify the other two vertices as `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`. However, if the input is `0 0 1 2`, the program incorrectly assumes these points form an edge of the square and outputs `-1` instead of recognizing that they form a diagonal and calculating the correct vertices.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the diagonal case separately by checking if the distance between the two points is equal to the side length of the square, and then calculating the correct positions accordingly.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
