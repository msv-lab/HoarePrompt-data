Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the program's logic when the two given points form a diagonal of the square rather than an edge. The program's current implementation assumes that the two given points are adjacent vertices, which leads to incorrect results in cases where they are diagonally opposite. Specifically, the logic fails to consider the possibility that the two points could form a diagonal, and it does not correctly handle the calculation of the remaining vertices in such cases.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `0 0 1 1`
  - The program should correctly identify the other two vertices as `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`.
  - However, the current logic would incorrectly assume these points form a vertical or horizontal edge, leading to an incorrect solution.

Another example:
- Input: `0 0 1 2`
  - The program incorrectly outputs `-1` because it assumes the points form an edge, which they do not.
  - The correct output should be the coordinates of the other two vertices, which are `(0, 2)` and `(1, 0)`.

The function summary provided confirms that the program's logic is based on the assumption that the given points form an edge of the square, which is not always true. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect in scenarios where the given points form a diagonal.

Final: **False**
