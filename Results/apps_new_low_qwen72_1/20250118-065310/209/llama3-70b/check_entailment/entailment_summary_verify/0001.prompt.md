You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Pashmak has fallen in love with an attractive girl called Parmida since one year ago...

Today, Pashmak set up a meeting with his partner in a romantic garden. Unfortunately, Pashmak has forgotten where the garden is. But he remembers that the garden looks like a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. He also remembers that there is exactly one tree on each vertex of the square. Now, Pashmak knows the position of only two of the trees. Help him to find the position of two remaining ones.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four space-separated x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) integers, where x_1 and y_1 are coordinates of the first tree and x_2 and y_2 are coordinates of the second tree. It's guaranteed that the given points are distinct.


-----Output-----

If there is no solution to the problem, print -1. Otherwise print four space-separated integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. 

Note that x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 must be in the range ( - 1000 ≤ x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 ≤ 1000).

- Program:
def func():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x2:
        (x3, x4) = (x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2))
        (y3, y4) = (y1, y2)
    else:
        (y3, y4) = (y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2))
        (x3, x4) = (x1, x2)
    if -1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and (-1000 <= y3 <= 1000) and (-1000 <= y4 <= 1000):
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads four integer values `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` from user input, where these integers are within the range [-100, 100] and `(x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2)`. The function then calculates two new sets of coordinates, `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)`, based on the following rules:
- If `x1 == x2`, then `x3 = x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`, `x4 = x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, `y3 = y1`, and `y4 = y2`.
- If `x1 ≠ x2`, then `x3 = x1`, `x4 = x2`, `y3 = y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`, and `y4 = y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`.

After calculating these coordinates, the function checks if `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` are all within the range [-1000, 1000]. If they are, the function prints `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`. If any of these values are outside the range, the function prints `-1`.

The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The final state of the program is that the calculated coordinates are either printed or `-1` is printed, depending on whether the calculated coordinates fall within the specified range.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the coordinates of the two missing vertices of a square given two of its vertices. The logic hinges on the properties of squares and their coordinates. If the x-coordinates of the two given points are the same, it implies they form a vertical edge of the square. Similarly, if the y-coordinates are the same, it implies they form a horizontal edge of the square. For both cases, the side length of the square is derived from the absolute difference between the y-coordinates or x-coordinates, respectively. The program then calculates the possible coordinates for the other two vertices and checks if they fall within the specified range.

However, there is a flaw in the program's logic when handling the case where the two given points do not form an edge of the square but rather a diagonal. In such a scenario, the program will incorrectly calculate the positions of the other two vertices, leading to an incorrect solution. This is because the current logic assumes that the two given points are adjacent vertices, which is not always the case.

For example, if the input is `0 0 1 1`, the program should correctly identify the other two vertices as `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`. However, if the input is `0 0 1 2`, the program incorrectly assumes these points form an edge of the square and outputs `-1` instead of recognizing that they form a diagonal and calculating the correct vertices.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the diagonal case separately by checking if the distance between the two points is equal to the side length of the square, and then calculating the correct positions accordingly.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct in all scenarios.
