### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program's logic. The program fails to handle cases where the two given points form a diagonal of the square. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads four integers `x1, y1, x2, y2` from the input, ensuring they are within the range [-100, 100] and that the points are distinct.

2. **Coordinate Calculation**:
   - If `x1 == x2`, the program assumes the points share the same x-coordinate, meaning they form a vertical side of the square. It then calculates the other two points as:
     - `x3 = x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`
     - `x4 = x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`
     - `y3 = y1`
     - `y4 = y2`
   - If `x1 â‰  x2`, the program assumes the points share the same y-coordinate, meaning they form a horizontal side of the square. It then calculates the other two points as:
     - `x3 = x1`
     - `x4 = x2`
     - `y3 = y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`
     - `y4 = y1 - abs(x1 - y2)`

3. **Range Check**: After calculating the coordinates, the program checks if `x3, x4, y3, y4` are within the range [-1000, 1000]. If they are, it prints the coordinates; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Flaw in Logic:

The program's logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that the two given points could form a diagonal of the square. In such cases, neither `x1 == x2` nor `y1 == y2` will be true, leading to incorrect calculations.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1: Input `0 0 0 1`**
  - The points are (0, 0) and (0, 1), forming a vertical side.
  - The program correctly calculates the other two points as (1, 0) and (1, 1).
  - Output: `1 0 1 1` (Correct)

- **Example 2: Input `0 0 1 1`**
  - The points are (0, 0) and (1, 1), forming a diagonal.
  - The program incorrectly assumes the points form a horizontal side and calculates the other two points as (0, 1) and (1, 0).
  - However, the program then checks the range and finds that the calculated points are within the range, so it prints `0 1 1 0` (Correct).

- **Example 3: Input `0 0 1 2`**
  - The points are (0, 0) and (1, 2), which do not form a valid square.
  - The program incorrectly assumes the points form a horizontal side and calculates the other two points as (0, 3) and (1, -1).
  - The program then checks the range and finds that the calculated points are within the range, so it prints `0 3 1 -1` (Incorrect, should be `-1`).

### Conclusion:

The program's logic is indeed flawed, as it fails to handle cases where the two given points form a diagonal of the square. This leads to incorrect calculations and outputs in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
