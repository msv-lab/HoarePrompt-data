Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case where the two given points form a diagonal of the square, rather than a side. The current logic assumes that the two points either share an x-coordinate or a y-coordinate, which means it will incorrectly calculate the positions of the other two vertices if the points form a diagonal.

For example, consider the input `0 0 1 1`. According to the problem, the correct output should be `0 1 1 0`, but the program will output `-1` because it incorrectly checks for the side conditions and fails to recognize the diagonal configuration. This makes the program incorrect for this specific case.
