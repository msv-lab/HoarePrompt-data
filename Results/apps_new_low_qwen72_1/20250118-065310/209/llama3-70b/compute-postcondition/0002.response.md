The code snippet provided modifies the variables `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` based on the initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. Here's the analysis of the entire block of code:

- The first line calculates `x3` as `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)` and `x4` as `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`. Since `x1` is equal to `x2`, the difference in the x-coordinates is zero, but the y-coordinates `y1` and `y2` can differ, which affects the calculation of `x3` and `x4`.
- The second line assigns the values of `y1` to `y3` and `y2` to `y4`, effectively creating new references to these y-coordinates without changing their values.

Combining these effects, the final state of the program is:

Output State: **x1 is an integer within the range [-100, 100], y1 is an integer within the range [-100, 100], x2 is equal to x1, y2 is an integer within the range [-100, 100], x3 is x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x4 is x1 - abs(y1 - y2), y3 is y1, y4 is y2**
