Functionality: ** The function reads four integer values `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` from user input, where these integers are within the range [-100, 100] and `(x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2)`. The function then calculates two new sets of coordinates, `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)`, based on the following rules:
- If `x1 == x2`, then `x3 = x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`, `x4 = x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, `y3 = y1`, and `y4 = y2`.
- If `x1 ≠ x2`, then `x3 = x1`, `x4 = x2`, `y3 = y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`, and `y4 = y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`.

After calculating these coordinates, the function checks if `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` are all within the range [-1000, 1000]. If they are, the function prints `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`. If any of these values are outside the range, the function prints `-1`.

The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The final state of the program is that the calculated coordinates are either printed or `-1` is printed, depending on whether the calculated coordinates fall within the specified range. **

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the input values are at the boundary of the allowed range (e.g., `x1 = -100`, `y1 = 100`), the calculated values could potentially exceed the range [-1000, 1000], leading to the function printing `-1`.
- If `x1` and `x2` are very close to each other, the calculated values might still be within the range even if the difference is large due to the absolute value operation.
- If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, the function will not execute as expected because the initial condition states that `(x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2)`. However, if this condition is not enforced externally, it could lead to incorrect calculations.
