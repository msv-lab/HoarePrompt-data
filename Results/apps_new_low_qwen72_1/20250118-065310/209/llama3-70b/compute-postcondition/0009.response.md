The provided code snippet is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This code simply prints `-1` to the console and does not alter any variables or states in the program.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with no changes to any variables. The only action taken is the printing of `-1`.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers within the range [-100, 100], and (x1, y1) â‰  (x2, y2). If `x1 == x2`, `x3` is `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`, `x4` is `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, `y3` is `y1`, and `y4` is `y2`. Otherwise, `x3` is `x1`, `y3` is `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`, `x4` is `x2`, and `y4` is `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`. At least one of the following conditions is true: `x3 < -1000` or `x3 > 1000` or `x4 < -1000` or `x4 > 1000` or `y3 < -1000` or `y3 > 1000` or `y4 < -1000` or `y4 > 1000`.**
