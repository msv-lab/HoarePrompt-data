Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers within the range [-100, 100], and (x1, y1) â‰  (x2, y2). If `x1 == x2`, `x3` is `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`, `x4` is `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, `y3` is `y1`, and `y4` is `y2`. Otherwise, `x3` is `x1`, `y3` is `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`, `x4` is `x2`, and `y4` is `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`. If `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` are all within the range [-1000, 1000], their values are printed. Otherwise, at least one of `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, or `y4` is outside the range [-1000, 1000].***
