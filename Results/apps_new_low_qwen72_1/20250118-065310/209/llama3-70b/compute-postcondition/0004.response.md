The provided code snippet performs the following operations:
- It calculates `y3` as the sum of `y1` and the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2`.
- It calculates `y4` as the difference between `y1` and the absolute difference between `x1` and `x2`.
- It assigns the values of `x1` and `x2` to `x3` and `x4`, respectively.

Given the initial conditions:
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers within the range [-100, 100].
- (x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2).
- `x1` ≠ `x2`.

After executing the code:
- `y3` is calculated as `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`.
- `y4` is calculated as `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`.
- `x3` is set to `x1`.
- `x4` is set to `x2`.

No other variables are affected by this code block.

Output State: **x1 is an integer, y1 is an integer, x2 is an integer, y2 is an integer, x3 is x1, y3 is y1 + abs(x1 - x2), x4 is x2, y4 is y1 - abs(x1 - x2)**
