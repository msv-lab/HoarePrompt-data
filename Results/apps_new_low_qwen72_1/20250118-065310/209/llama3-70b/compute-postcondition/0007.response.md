The provided code prints the values of `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`. These variables are determined based on the conditions specified in the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers within the range [-100, 100], and (x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2).
- If `x1 == x2`:
  - `x3` is `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`
  - `x4` is `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`
  - `y3` is `y1`
  - `y4` is `y2`
- Otherwise:
  - `x3` is `x1`
  - `y3` is `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`
  - `x4` is `x2`
  - `y4` is `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`
- Additionally, `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` are within the range [-1000, 1000].

### Code Execution:
The code snippet `print(x3, y3, x4, y4)` simply prints the values of these variables. The values of `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are already determined based on the conditions in the initial state, so no further computation is needed.

### Output State:
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers within the range [-100, 100], and (x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2).
- If `x1 == x2`:
  - `x3` is `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`
  - `x4` is `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`
  - `y3` is `y1`
  - `y4` is `y2`
- Otherwise:
  - `x3` is `x1`
  - `y3` is `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`
  - `x4` is `x2`
  - `y4` is `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`
- `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` are within the range [-1000, 1000].
- The values of `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are printed.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers within the range [-100, 100], and (x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2). If `x1 == x2`, `x3` is `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)`, `x4` is `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)`, `y3` is `y1`, and `y4` is `y2`. Otherwise, `x3` is `x1`, `y3` is `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`, `x4` is `x2`, and `y4` is `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`. `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` are within the range [-1000, 1000]. The values of `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are printed.**
