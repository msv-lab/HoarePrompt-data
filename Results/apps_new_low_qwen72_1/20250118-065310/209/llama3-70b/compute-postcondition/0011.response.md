The function `func` accepts four parameters: `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`. These parameters are integers within the range [-100, 100], and the coordinates `(x_1, y_1)` are not equal to `(x_2, y_2)`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Since the output is not specified, I cannot provide a complete description of the functionality. However, based on the provided parameters and constraints, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, which are integers within the range [-100, 100], and ensures that `(x_1, y_1)` â‰  `(x_2, y_2)`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not defined.**
