The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are updated to the values provided by the user input. The input is split into four parts, and each part is converted to an integer. The initial values of `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, and `y_2` are no longer relevant, as they are overwritten by the new values from the input. The condition that `(x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2)` remains valid, assuming the user input maintains this constraint.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers within the range [-100, 100] provided by user input, and (x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2)**
