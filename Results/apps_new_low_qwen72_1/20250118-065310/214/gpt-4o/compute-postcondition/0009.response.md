The code snippet assigns the value of the first element in the `possible_floors` set plus 1 to the variable `flats_per_floor`.

Given that the length of `possible_floors` is 1, the set contains a single value which is the result of the floor division `(k_i - 1) // f_i` for all tuples `(k_i, f_i)` in `flats_memory`. Let's denote this single value as `x`. Therefore, the value of `flats_per_floor` will be `x + 1`.

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `flats_per_floor`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k_2 - 1) // f_2, ..., (k_n - 1) // f_n}` if `flats_memory` has `n` tuples, otherwise it contains the results of the floor division for each tuple in `flats_memory`. The length of `possible_floors` is 1, meaning all floor divisions `(k_i - 1) // f_i` result in the same value, `flats_per_floor` is `list(possible_floors)[0] + 1`**.
