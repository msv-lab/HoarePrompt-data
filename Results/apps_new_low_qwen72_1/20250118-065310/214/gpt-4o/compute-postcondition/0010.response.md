Output State: **The program returns the result of `(n - 1) // (list(possible_floors)[0] + 1) + 1`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `list(possible_floors)[0]` is the single element in the set `possible_floors`, which is the result of the floor division `(k_i - 1) // f_i` for all tuples `(k_i, f_i)` in the list `flats_memory`.**
