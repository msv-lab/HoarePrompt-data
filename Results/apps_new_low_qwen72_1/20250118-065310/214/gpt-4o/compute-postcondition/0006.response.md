The code snippet adds the value \((k - 1) // f\) to the set `possible_floors`. Given that `k` and `f` are the third tuple in `flats_memory`, and `possible_floors` already contains \(\{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k - 1) // f\}\), adding \((k - 1) // f\) again does not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Therefore, the output state remains the same for all variables except that the set `possible_floors` now explicitly includes the value \((k - 1) // f\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `flats_memory` must have at least three tuples, `k` and `f` are the third tuple in `flats_memory`, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k - 1) // f}`.**
