The code initializes an empty set named `possible_floors`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `flats_memory`. Therefore, the output state includes the initial state with the addition of the new variable `possible_floors` being an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `possible_floors` is an empty set.**
