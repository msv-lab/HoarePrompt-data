The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k`, `f`, and the list `flats_memory`. For the loop to execute the first time, `flats_memory` must contain at least one tuple. The values of `n` and `m` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, but they are part of the initial state.

For the loop to execute, the following must be true:
- `flats_memory` must have at least one tuple.
- `k` and `f` will take the values of the first tuple in `flats_memory`.

Given the initial state, the modified state should reflect these conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `flats_memory` must have at least one tuple, `k` and `f` are the first tuple in `flats_memory`, `possible_floors` is an empty set.**
