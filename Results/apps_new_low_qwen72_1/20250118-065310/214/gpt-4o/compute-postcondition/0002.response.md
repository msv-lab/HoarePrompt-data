The code adds the result of `(k - 1) // f` to the `possible_floors` set. Given that `k` and `f` are the first tuple in `flats_memory`, and `possible_floors` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `possible_floors` will contain a single element which is the result of the floor division `(k - 1) // f`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `flats_memory` must have at least one tuple, `k` and `f` are the first tuple in `flats_memory`, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k - 1) // f}`.**
