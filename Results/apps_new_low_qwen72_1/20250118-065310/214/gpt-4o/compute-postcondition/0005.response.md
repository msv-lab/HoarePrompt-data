To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `k`, `f`, and `flats_memory`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head specifies that `k` and `f` are being iterated over from the list `flats_memory`. This means that for each iteration, the values of `k` and `f` are updated to the next tuple in the list.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100.
   - `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct.
   - `flats_memory` must have at least two tuples.
   - `k` and `f` are the second tuple in `flats_memory`.
   - `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k - 1) // f}`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `flats_memory`, the next iteration will use the third tuple in the list.
   - Therefore, `k` and `f` need to be updated to the third tuple in `flats_memory`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `flats_memory` must have at least three tuples.

### Adjusted State:
- `k` and `f` will be the third tuple in `flats_memory`.
- `flats_memory` must have at least three tuples.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `flats_memory` must have at least three tuples, `k` and `f` are the third tuple in `flats_memory`, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k - 1) // f}`.**
