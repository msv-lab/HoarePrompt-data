The code snippet adds a new element to the set `possible_floors`. This new element is calculated as `(k - 1) // f`, where `k` and `f` are the second elements of the second tuple in the list `flats_memory`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100
- `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct
- `flats_memory` must have at least two tuples
- `k` and `f` are the second tuple in `flats_memory`
- `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1}` from the first tuple

After executing the code:
- `possible_floors` now contains an additional element, which is `(k - 1) // f`, where `k` and `f` are the second elements of the second tuple in `flats_memory`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `flats_memory` must have at least two tuples, `k` and `f` are the second tuple in `flats_memory`, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k - 1) // f}`.**
