Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k_2 - 1) // f_2, ..., (k_n - 1) // f_n}` if `flats_memory` has `n` tuples, otherwise it contains the results of the floor division for each tuple in `flats_memory`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(k, f)` in the list `flats_memory`.
   - For each tuple, it computes `(k - 1) // f` and adds the result to the set `possible_floors`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` and `m` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `flats_memory` is a list of tuples that remains unchanged.
   - `possible_floors` is updated with each iteration, adding the result of `(k - 1) // f` for each tuple `(k, f)` in `flats_memory`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute once for each tuple in `flats_memory`.
   - After all iterations, `possible_floors` will contain the unique results of `(k - 1) // f` for each tuple `(k, f)` in `flats_memory`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - If `flats_memory` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `possible_floors` remains an empty set.
   - If `flats_memory` has `n` tuples, `possible_floors` will contain `n` elements, each being the result of `(k_i - 1) // f_i` for the corresponding tuple `(k_i, f_i)`.

Thus, the final output state after the loop finishes executing is as described above.
