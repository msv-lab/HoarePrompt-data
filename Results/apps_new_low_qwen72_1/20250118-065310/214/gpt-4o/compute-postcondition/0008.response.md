Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k_2 - 1) // f_2, ..., (k_n - 1) // f_n}` if `flats_memory` has `n` tuples, otherwise it contains the results of the floor division for each tuple in `flats_memory`. The length of `possible_floors` is 1, meaning all floor divisions `(k_i - 1) // f_i` result in the same value.***
