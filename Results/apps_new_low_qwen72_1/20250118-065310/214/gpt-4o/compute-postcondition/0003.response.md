The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and `f`, and the list `flats_memory`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `flats_memory` list. For the loop to execute again, there must be another tuple in `flats_memory` after the current tuple `(k, f)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `flats_memory` had at least one tuple, and `k` and `f` were the first tuple in `flats_memory`. After the loop advances to the next iteration, `k` and `f` will take the values of the next tuple in `flats_memory`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `flats_memory` must have at least two tuples, and `k` and `f` will be the second tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `flats_memory` must have at least two tuples, `k` and `f` are the second tuple in `flats_memory`, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k - 1) // f}` from the first tuple.**
