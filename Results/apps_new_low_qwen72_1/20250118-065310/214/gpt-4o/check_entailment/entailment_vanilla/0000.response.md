Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the potential number of flats per floor based on the provided memory of flats and their respective floors. The logic is to iterate through each remembered flat and calculate the possible number of flats per floor using the formula `(k - 1) // f`, which gives the index of the last flat on a given floor. If all calculated values are the same, it implies a consistent number of flats per floor. This value is then used to determine the floor for the nth flat. If the values differ, it indicates ambiguity and the function returns `-1`.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic of calculating the number of flats per floor. The formula `(k - 1) // f` should actually be `(f - 1) * x + 1 <= k <= f * x`, where `x` is the number of flats per floor. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the number of flats per floor, leading to potential errors in determining the correct floor for the nth flat.

To fix this, the program should correctly calculate the number of flats per floor and ensure that all remembered flats are consistent with this calculation.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
flats_memory = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

def func_1(n, m, flats_memory):
    possible_floors = set()
    for (k, f) in flats_memory:
        # Calculate the number of flats per floor
        for flats_per_floor in range(1, 101):
            if (f - 1) * flats_per_floor + 1 <= k <= f * flats_per_floor:
                possible_floors.add(flats_per_floor)
                break
    if len(possible_floors) == 1:
        flats_per_floor = list(possible_floors)[0]
        return (n - 1) // flats_per_floor + 1
    else:
        return -1

print(func_1(n, m, flats_memory))
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of flats per floor is correctly determined and checked for consistency across all remembered flats.
