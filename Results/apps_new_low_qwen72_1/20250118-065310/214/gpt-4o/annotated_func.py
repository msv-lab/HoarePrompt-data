#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, and flats_memory is a list of tuples (k_i, f_i) where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all k_i are distinct.
def func_1(n, m, flats_memory):
    possible_floors = set()
    for (k, f) in flats_memory:
        possible_floors.add((k - 1) // f)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, `flats_memory` is a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct, `possible_floors` is a set containing `{(k_1 - 1) // f_1, (k_2 - 1) // f_2, ..., (k_n - 1) // f_n}` if `flats_memory` has `n` tuples, otherwise it contains the results of the floor division for each tuple in `flats_memory`.
    if (len(possible_floors) == 1) :
        flats_per_floor = list(possible_floors)[0] + 1
        return (n - 1) // flats_per_floor + 1
        #The program returns the result of `(n - 1) // (list(possible_floors)[0] + 1) + 1`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `list(possible_floors)[0]` is the single element in the set `possible_floors`, which is the result of the floor division `(k_i - 1) // f_i` for all tuples `(k_i, f_i)` in the list `flats_memory`.
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` (an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, though `m` is not used in the function), and `flats_memory` (a list of tuples `(k_i, f_i)` where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 100, and all `k_i` are distinct). The function computes a set `possible_floors` containing the results of the floor division `(k_i - 1) // f_i` for each tuple `(k_i, f_i)` in `flats_memory`. If `possible_floors` contains exactly one unique value, the function returns the result of `(n - 1) // (flats_per_floor + 1) + 1`, where `flats_per_floor` is the single element in `possible_floors`. If `possible_floors` contains more than one unique value or is empty, the function returns -1. The parameter `m` is unused in the function.
