Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Mister B once received a gift: it was a book about aliens, which he started read immediately. This book had c pages.

At first day Mister B read v_0 pages, but after that he started to speed up. Every day, starting from the second, he read a pages more than on the previous day (at first day he read v_0 pages, at second — v_0 + a pages, at third — v_0 + 2a pages, and so on). But Mister B is just a human, so he physically wasn't able to read more than v_1 pages per day.

Also, to refresh his memory, every day, starting from the second, Mister B had to reread last l pages he read on the previous day. Mister B finished the book when he read the last page for the first time.

Help Mister B to calculate how many days he needed to finish the book.


-----Input-----

First and only line contains five space-separated integers: c, v_0, v_1, a and l (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the length of the book in pages, the initial reading speed, the maximum reading speed, the acceleration in reading speed and the number of pages for rereading.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of days Mister B needed to finish the book.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 5 10 5 4

Output
1

Input
12 4 12 4 1

Output
3

Input
15 1 100 0 0

Output
15



-----Note-----

In the first sample test the book contains 5 pages, so Mister B read it right at the first day.

In the second sample test at first day Mister B read pages number 1 - 4, at second day — 4 - 11, at third day — 11 - 12 and finished the book.

In third sample test every day Mister B read 1 page of the book, so he finished in 15 days.

# Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (c, v_0, v_1, a, l) = map(int, input().split())
    days = 0
    pages_read = 0
    current_speed = v_0
    while pages_read < c:
        days += 1
        if days == 1:
            pages_read += v_0
        else:
            pages_read += min(current_speed, v_1) - l
            current_speed += a
        current_speed = min(current_speed, v_1)
        if pages_read < 0:
            pages_read = 0
    print(days)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` reads five integer inputs `c`, `v_0`, `v_1`, `a`, and `l` from the user, where `1 ≤ c ≤ 1000`, `0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000`, and `0 ≤ a ≤ 1000`. It calculates the minimum number of days required to read at least `c` pages, given the following conditions:
- On the first day, the reader reads `v_0` pages.
- On subsequent days, the reader reads `min(current_speed, v_1) - l` pages, where `current_speed` starts at `v_0` and increases by `a` each day, up to a maximum of `v_1`.
- If the number of pages read becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
- The function prints the total number of days required to reach or exceed `c` pages read.
- After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original input values (`c`, `v_0`, `v_1`, `a`, `l`), the number of days (`days`), the total pages read (`pages_read`), and the final reading speed (`current_speed`).
