You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mister B once received a gift: it was a book about aliens, which he started read immediately. This book had c pages.

At first day Mister B read v_0 pages, but after that he started to speed up. Every day, starting from the second, he read a pages more than on the previous day (at first day he read v_0 pages, at second — v_0 + a pages, at third — v_0 + 2a pages, and so on). But Mister B is just a human, so he physically wasn't able to read more than v_1 pages per day.

Also, to refresh his memory, every day, starting from the second, Mister B had to reread last l pages he read on the previous day. Mister B finished the book when he read the last page for the first time.

Help Mister B to calculate how many days he needed to finish the book.


-----Input-----

First and only line contains five space-separated integers: c, v_0, v_1, a and l (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the length of the book in pages, the initial reading speed, the maximum reading speed, the acceleration in reading speed and the number of pages for rereading.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of days Mister B needed to finish the book.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 5 10 5 4

Output
1

Input
12 4 12 4 1

Output
3

Input
15 1 100 0 0

Output
15



-----Note-----

In the first sample test the book contains 5 pages, so Mister B read it right at the first day.

In the second sample test at first day Mister B read pages number 1 - 4, at second day — 4 - 11, at third day — 11 - 12 and finished the book.

In third sample test every day Mister B read 1 page of the book, so he finished in 15 days.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (c, v_0, v_1, a, l) = map(int, input().split())
    days = 0
    pages_read = 0
    current_speed = v_0
    while pages_read < c:
        days += 1
        if days == 1:
            pages_read += v_0
        else:
            pages_read += min(current_speed, v_1) - l
            current_speed += a
        current_speed = min(current_speed, v_1)
        if pages_read < 0:
            pages_read = 0
    print(days)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads five integer inputs `c`, `v_0`, `v_1`, `a`, and `l` from the user, where `1 ≤ c ≤ 1000`, `0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000`, and `0 ≤ a ≤ 1000`. It calculates the minimum number of days required to read at least `c` pages, given the following conditions:
- On the first day, the reader reads `v_0` pages.
- On subsequent days, the reader reads `min(current_speed, v_1) - l` pages, where `current_speed` starts at `v_0` and increases by `a` each day, up to a maximum of `v_1`.
- If the number of pages read becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
- The function prints the total number of days required to reach or exceed `c` pages read.
- After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original input values (`c`, `v_0`, `v_1`, `a`, `l`), the number of days (`days`), the total pages read (`pages_read`), and the final reading speed (`current_speed`).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by simulating each day's reading process until the book is completed. Here’s a step-by-step analysis of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `days` is initialized to 0 to count the number of days.
   - `pages_read` is initialized to 0 to track the total number of pages read.
   - `current_speed` is initialized to `v_0`, the initial reading speed.

2. **Reading Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `pages_read` is greater than or equal to `c` (the total number of pages in the book).
   - On the first day (`days == 1`), `pages_read` is increased by `v_0`.
   - For subsequent days, the number of pages read each day is calculated as `min(current_speed, v_1) - l`. This ensures that the reading speed does not exceed `v_1` and accounts for the `l` pages that need to be reread.
   - `current_speed` is increased by `a` each day, but it is capped at `v_1`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The condition `if pages_read < 0: pages_read = 0` is included to handle any negative values for `pages_read`, although this should not occur given the problem constraints.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the number of days taken to finish the book is printed.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Initial Day Calculation**: The program correctly handles the first day by adding `v_0` to `pages_read`.
- **Subsequent Days Calculation**: The formula `pages_read += min(current_speed, v_1) - l` is correct for calculating the pages read each day after the first day.
- **Speed Cap**: The program correctly caps the reading speed at `v_1` using `current_speed = min(current_speed, v_1)`.

However, there is a minor issue with the edge case handling:
- The condition `if pages_read < 0: pages_read = 0` is unnecessary and can be removed since `pages_read` should always be non-negative.

### Final Check:
- The program correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
