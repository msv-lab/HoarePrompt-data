### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads five integers from the input: `c` (total pages), `v_0` (initial reading speed), `v_1` (maximum reading speed), `a` (acceleration), and `l` (rereading pages).
   - These values are correctly assigned to variables and the initial state is set up with `days = 0`, `pages_read = 0`, and `current_speed = v_0`.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop continues until `pages_read` is no longer less than `c`.
   - On the first day, `pages_read` is incremented by `v_0`.
   - For subsequent days, `pages_read` is incremented by `min(current_speed, v_1) - l`.
   - `current_speed` is increased by `a` each day, but it is capped at `v_1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a` is 0, meaning the reading speed does not increase.
   - The program also handles the case where `l` is 0, meaning no rereading is necessary.
   - The program ensures that `current_speed` does not exceed `v_1`.

4. **Negative Pages Read:**
   - The program includes a check to reset `pages_read` to 0 if it becomes negative. However, this check is unnecessary because the minimum value of `pages_read` should always be non-negative due to the way the loop increments `pages_read`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of days required to read at least `c` pages, which is the correct output based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
