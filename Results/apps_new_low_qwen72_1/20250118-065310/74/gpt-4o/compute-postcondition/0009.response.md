Postcondition: ***`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `pages_read` is `v_0` if `days` is 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `v_0 - l`, `current_speed` is `min(v_0, v_1)` if `days` is 1, otherwise `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`, and `pages_read` is less than 0.***
