Postcondition: ***`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `days` is 1, `pages_read` is 0, `current_speed` is `v_0`. The condition `days == 1` is true.***
