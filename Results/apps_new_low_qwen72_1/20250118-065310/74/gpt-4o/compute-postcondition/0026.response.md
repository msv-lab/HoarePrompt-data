The provided code snippet sets `pages_read` to 0. This operation affects the `pages_read` variable only, setting it to 0 regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`c`, `v_0`, `v_1`, `a`, `l`, `days`, `current_speed`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `days` is incremented by 1, `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`, `pages_read` is 0.**
