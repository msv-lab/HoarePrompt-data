To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the relevant variables.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while pages_read < c:
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `pages_read`: The number of pages read.
- `c`: The total number of pages.

### Current State:
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000.
- `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000.
- `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000.
- `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000.
- `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0.
- `days` is incremented by 1.
- `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`.
- If `pages_read` < 0, `pages_read` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + v_0, c)` if `days` was 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l, c)`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue as long as `pages_read` is less than `c`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `pages_read` must be less than `c`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `c` is fixed and `pages_read` is updated based on the conditions given, we need to ensure that `pages_read` is still less than `c` after the update.
- Given the current state, `pages_read` is updated to `min(pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l, c)` if `days` is not 1, or `min(pages_read + v_0, c)` if `days` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `pages_read` must be less than `c` after this update.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute one more time if `pages_read` is less than `c` after the update.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the variables in the loop head (`pages_read` and `c`).

State: **`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `days` is incremented by 1, `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`, `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l, c)` if `days` was not 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + v_0, c)`.**
