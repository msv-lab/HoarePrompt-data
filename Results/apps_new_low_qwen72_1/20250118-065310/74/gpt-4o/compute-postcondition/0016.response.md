Postcondition: ***`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + v_0, c)` if `days` was 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l, c)`, `days` is incremented by 1, `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`***
