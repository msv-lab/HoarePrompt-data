The function `func_1` accepts parameters `c`, `v_0`, `v_1`, `a`, and `l`, all of which are integers. The constraints for these parameters are as follows:
- `1 ≤ c ≤ 1000`
- `0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000`
- `0 ≤ a ≤ 1000`

Since the output description is not provided, I cannot determine the specific return value of the function based on the given parameters. However, based on the parameters and their constraints, the functionality of the function can be described as:

Functionality: **The function accepts five integer parameters: `c`, `v_0`, `v_1`, `a`, and `l`, where `1 ≤ c ≤ 1000`, `0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000`, and `0 ≤ a ≤ 1000`. The function's return value depends on the specific logic within the function body, which is not provided.**
