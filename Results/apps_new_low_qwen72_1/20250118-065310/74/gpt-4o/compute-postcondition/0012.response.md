The only variable in the loop head is `pages_read`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pages_read`. If `pages_read` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pages_read` is 0 if `pages_read` < 0, otherwise `pages_read` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `pages_read` must still be less than `c`.

Since `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, and `pages_read` must be less than `c` for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `pages_read` is less than `c`.

State: **`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `pages_read` is 0 if `pages_read` < 0, otherwise `pages_read` remains unchanged and must be less than `c`. `current_speed` is `min(v_0, v_1)` if `days` is 1, otherwise `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`.**
