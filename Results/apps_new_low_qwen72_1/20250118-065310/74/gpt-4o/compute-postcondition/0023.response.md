The provided code snippet modifies the variables `pages_read` and `current_speed` based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the entire block of code to determine the final state.

### Initial State:
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000
- `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000
- `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0
- `days` is incremented by 1 (so `days` is at least 2)
- `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`
- `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l, c)` if `days` was not 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + v_0, c)`

### Code Execution:
1. **First Line:**
   ```python
   pages_read += min(current_speed, v_1) - l
   ```
   - `current_speed` is already set to `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`.
   - `min(current_speed, v_1)` is equivalent to `current_speed` because `current_speed` is already the minimum of `v_0 + a` and `v_1`.
   - Therefore, `pages_read` is incremented by `current_speed - l`.

2. **Second Line:**
   ```python
   current_speed += a
   ```
   - `current_speed` is incremented by `a`.

### Final State:
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `v_0` remains unchanged.
- `v_1` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `days` remains incremented by 1.
- `current_speed` is now `min(v_0 + a, v_1) + a`.
- `pages_read` is updated to `pages_read + min(min(v_0 + a, v_1), v_1) - l`.

Combining these changes, the final state is:
Output State: **c is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, v_0 is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, v_1 is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, a is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, l is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, days is incremented by 1, current_speed is min(v_0 + a, v_1) + a, pages_read is pages_read + min(min(v_0 + a, v_1), v_1) - l**
