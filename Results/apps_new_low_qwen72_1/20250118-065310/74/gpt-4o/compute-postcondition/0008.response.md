The code snippet updates the value of `current_speed` to be the minimum between its current value and `v_1`.

- If `days` is 1, `current_speed` is initially `v_0`.
- If `days` is not 1, `current_speed` is initially `v_0 + a`.

In both cases, the updated value of `current_speed` will be the minimum of its initial value and `v_1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `pages_read` is `v_0` if `days` is 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `v_0 - l`, `current_speed` is `min(v_0, v_1)` if `days` is 1, otherwise `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`.**
