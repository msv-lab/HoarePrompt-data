Initial State:
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000
- `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000
- `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0
- `pages_read` is 0 if `pages_read` < 0, otherwise `pages_read` remains unchanged and must be less than `c`
- `days` is incremented by 1
- `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`

Code Block:
```
pages_read += min(current_speed, v_1) - l
current_speed += a
```

Analysis:
1. The first line increments `pages_read` by the value of `min(current_speed, v_1) - l`.
   - `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`.
   - Therefore, `pages_read` becomes `pages_read + min(min(v_0 + a, v_1), v_1) - l`.
   - Simplifying, `pages_read` becomes `pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l`.

2. The second line increments `current_speed` by the value of `a`.
   - `current_speed` becomes `min(v_0 + a, v_1) + a`.

Final Output State:
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000
- `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000
- `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0
- `pages_read` is `pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l` (and must be less than `c`)
- `days` is incremented by 1
- `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1) + a`

Output State: **`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `pages_read` is `pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l` (and must be less than `c`), `days` is incremented by 1, `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1) + a`**
