The code snippet `pages_read += v_0` increments the value of `pages_read` by `v_0`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **`pages_read`**: This variable is incremented by `v_0`. Since `pages_read` must be less than `c` and non-negative, we need to ensure that the new value of `pages_read` does not violate these conditions.
   - If `pages_read + v_0` is less than `c`, `pages_read` becomes `pages_read + v_0`.
   - If `pages_read + v_0` is greater than or equal to `c`, `pages_read` becomes `c` (since it cannot exceed `c`).

2. **Other Variables**: The values of `c`, `v_0`, `v_1`, `a`, `l`, `days`, and `current_speed` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + v_0, c)`, `days` is incremented by 1, `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`**
