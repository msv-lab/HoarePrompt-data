The code snippet `days += 1` increments the value of `days` by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged, except for `current_speed`, which depends on the updated value of `days`.

Given the initial state:
- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000
- `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000
- `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0
- `pages_read` is 0 if `pages_read` < 0, otherwise `pages_read` remains unchanged and must be less than `c`
- `current_speed` is `min(v_0, v_1)` if `days` is 1, otherwise `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`

After executing `days += 1`:
- `days` is incremented by 1
- `current_speed` is now `min(v_0 + a, v_1)` because `days` is no longer 1

Therefore, the output state is:
**`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `pages_read` is 0 if `pages_read` < 0, otherwise `pages_read` remains unchanged and must be less than `c`, `days` is incremented by 1, `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`**
