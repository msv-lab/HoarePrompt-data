The value of `days` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `days` is 1.

Output State: **`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `days` is 1, `pages_read` is 0, `current_speed` is `v_0`**
