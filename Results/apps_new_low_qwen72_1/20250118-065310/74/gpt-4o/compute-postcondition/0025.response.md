The code snippet updates the value of `current_speed` to be the minimum of its current value and `v_1`. Since the initial value of `current_speed` is already defined as `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`, the new value of `current_speed` will be the minimum of `min(v_0 + a, v_1)` and `v_1`. This effectively means that `current_speed` will be set to `min(v_0 + a, v_1)` again, as `v_1` is already considered in the initial calculation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `days` is incremented by 1, `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`, `pages_read` is `pages_read + v_0` if `days` was 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `pages_read + min(min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l, c)`.**
