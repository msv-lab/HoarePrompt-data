The code block provided modifies the values of `pages_read` and `current_speed` based on the initial state and the operations defined in the code. Here's the analysis and the resulting final state:

- The first line updates `pages_read` by adding the result of `min(current_speed, v_1) - l` to its current value. Since `current_speed` is initially `v_0` and `v_0` is less than or equal to `v_1`, the expression `min(current_speed, v_1)` simplifies to `v_0`. Therefore, `pages_read` becomes `pages_read + (v_0 - l)`.
- The second line increments `current_speed` by `a`. Thus, `current_speed` becomes `v_0 + a`.

Combining these changes, the final state is:

Output State: **c is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, v_0 is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, v_1 is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, a is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, l is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, days is not 1, pages_read is (v_0 - l), current_speed is (v_0 + a)**
