The code snippet updates the value of `current_speed` to be the minimum of its current value and `v_1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000
- `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000
- `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000
- `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0
- `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + v_0, c)` if `days` was 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l, c)`
- `days` is incremented by 1
- `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`

After executing the code snippet:
- `current_speed` is updated to `min(current_speed, v_1)`, which simplifies to `min(min(v_0 + a, v_1), v_1)`. Since `min(v_0 + a, v_1)` is already less than or equal to `v_1`, `current_speed` remains `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `v_0` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `v_1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0 ≤ v_1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l < v_0, `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + v_0, c)` if `days` was 1, otherwise `pages_read` is `min(pages_read + min(v_0 + a, v_1) - l, c)`, `days` is incremented by 1, `current_speed` is `min(v_0 + a, v_1)`**
