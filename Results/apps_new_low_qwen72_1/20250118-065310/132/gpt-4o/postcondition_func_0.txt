The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y` of `n` integers each from the standard input. It then calculates the sums of the elements in `x` and `y`. If the sum of the elements in `y` is greater than the sum of the elements in `x`, the function prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes". The function does not return any value. After the function executes, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `x` and `y` remain lists of `n` integers each in the range [0, 1000], and the sums `total_x` and `total_y` are calculated but not used further.
