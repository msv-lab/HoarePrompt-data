Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program checks if the total number of stones in the second visit (`total_y`) is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first visit (`total_x`). However, it fails to account for the possibility that stones could be moved between piles without changing the total number of stones. Specifically, the program will incorrectly output "Yes" even if the stones cannot be rearranged to match the second configuration due to the constraints of moving only one stone at a time.

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```
Output:
```
Yes
```
Expected Output:
```
No
```

In this case, the total number of stones remains the same (14), but it is impossible to move stones from the initial configuration `[2, 3, 9]` to the final configuration `[1, 7, 9]` by moving only one stone at a time. The program incorrectly outputs "Yes" because it only checks the total number of stones and not the feasibility of the moves.
