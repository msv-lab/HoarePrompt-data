Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if the second state of the stone piles can be reached from the first state by the actions of the jury members, who can either take a stone or move a stone between piles. The key observation is that the total number of stones should not increase from the first state to the second state, because the only actions allowed do not add new stones but can only redistribute or remove them.

The provided program calculates the total number of stones in both the initial and final states (`total_x` and `total_y`, respectively). If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it is impossible for the jury members to achieve the second state from the first, as no stones are added; thus, the program correctly prints "No". If `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, it is possible that the jury members could have taken or moved stones to match the second state, so the program prints "Yes".

This logic is sufficient to solve the problem as stated, and the program handles all edge cases correctly (e.g., when the total number of stones remains the same or decreases).

Correctness: **True**
