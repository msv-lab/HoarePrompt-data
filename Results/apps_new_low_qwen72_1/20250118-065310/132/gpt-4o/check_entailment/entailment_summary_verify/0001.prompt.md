You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if total_y > total_x:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y` of `n` integers each from the standard input. It then calculates the sums of the elements in `x` and `y`. If the sum of the elements in `y` is greater than the sum of the elements in `x`, the function prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes". The function does not return any value. After the function executes, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `x` and `y` remain lists of `n` integers each in the range [0, 1000], and the sums `total_x` and `total_y` are calculated but not used further.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if the second state of the stone piles can be reached from the first state by the actions of the jury members, who can either take a stone or move a stone between piles. The key observation is that the total number of stones should not increase from the first state to the second state, because the only actions allowed do not add new stones but can only redistribute or remove them.

The provided program calculates the total number of stones in both the initial and final states (`total_x` and `total_y`, respectively). If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it is impossible for the jury members to achieve the second state from the first, as no stones are added; thus, the program correctly prints "No". If `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, it is possible that the jury members could have taken or moved stones to match the second state, so the program prints "Yes".

This logic is sufficient to solve the problem as stated, and the program handles all edge cases correctly (e.g., when the total number of stones remains the same or decreases).
