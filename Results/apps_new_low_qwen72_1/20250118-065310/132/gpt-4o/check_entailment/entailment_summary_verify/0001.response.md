Reasoning:  
The original assessment is accurate. The core of the problem lies in ensuring that the total number of stones does not increase from the first state to the second state, which aligns with the actions that the jury members can perform (taking a stone or moving a stone between piles). The provided program effectively captures this by comparing the total number of stones in the initial state (`total_x`) and the final state (`total_y`). 

If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it is impossible for the jury members to have achieved the second state from the first, as no stones are added. This is correctly handled by the program, which prints "No" in this case. Conversely, if `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, it is possible for the jury members to have redistributed or removed stones to match the second state, and the program correctly prints "Yes" in this case.

The function summary confirms that the program reads the input as specified, calculates the necessary sums, and makes the correct comparison. The logic is sound and covers all the necessary conditions to determine the validity of the participants' notes.

Final: **True**
