The code snippet `print('Yes')` prints the string 'Yes' to the console. This action does not alter any of the variables or their values in the current state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing to the console.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, x is a list of n integers each in the range [0, 1000], y is a list of n integers each in the range [0, 1000], total_x is the sum of the elements in x, total_y is the sum of the elements in y, and total_y is less than or equal to total_x, 'Yes' has been printed to the console.**
