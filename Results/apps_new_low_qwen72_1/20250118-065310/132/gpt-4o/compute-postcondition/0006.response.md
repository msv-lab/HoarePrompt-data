The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each, where 0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000 for all i. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot accurately describe the return value without additional details.

However, assuming the function processes these inputs in some way (since the output is not explicitly stated), I will describe the parameters and leave the return value as unknown.
