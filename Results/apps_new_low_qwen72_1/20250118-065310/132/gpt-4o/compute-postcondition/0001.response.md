Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `x` is a list of n integers each in the range [0, 1000], `y` is a list of n integers each in the range [0, 1000], `total_x` is the sum of the elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the elements in `y`, and the current value of `total_y` is greater than the current value of `total_x`.***
