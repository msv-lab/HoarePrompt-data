The provided code reads an integer `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y`, each of length `n`. It then calculates the sum of the elements in `x` and `y`, storing these sums in `total_x` and `total_y`, respectively. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each, where 0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000 for all i.

After executing the code:
- `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user.
- `x` is updated to a list of `n` integers provided by the user.
- `y` is updated to a list of `n` integers provided by the user.
- `total_x` is the sum of the elements in `x`.
- `total_y` is the sum of the elements in `y`.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, x is a list of n integers each in the range [0, 1000], y is a list of n integers each in the range [0, 1000], total_x is the sum of the elements in x, total_y is the sum of the elements in y**.
