You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Top-model Izabella participates in the competition. She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.

Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.


-----Input-----

In the only line given a non-empty binary string s with length up to 100.


-----Output-----

Print «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
100010001

Output
yes
Input
100

Output
no


-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can get string 1 000 000 after removing two ones which is a representation of number 64 in the binary numerical system.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    if '1' not in s:
        print('no')
    else:
        index_of_first_one = s.find('1')
        remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]
        count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')
        if count_of_zeros >= 6:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a non-empty binary string `s` with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
def func():
    s = input()
    if ('1' not in s) :
        print('no')
    else :
        index_of_first_one = s.find('1')

remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]

count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')
        if (count_of_zeros >= 6) :
            print('yes')
        else :
            print('no')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If `count_of_zeros` is greater than or equal to 6, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count_of_zeros` is less than 6, the function prints 'no' to the console and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input is a non-empty binary string `s` with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. If `s` does not contain the character '1', 'no' is printed. If `s` contains at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', and `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If `count_of_zeros` is greater than or equal to 6, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count_of_zeros` is less than 6, the function prints 'no' to the console and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a non-empty binary string `s` from the user input, where each character is either '0' or '1'. It checks if the string contains the character '1'. If the string does not contain '1', it prints 'no' and the function ends. If the string contains at least one '1', it finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' and creates a substring `remaining_string` starting from the character immediately following the first '1'. It then counts the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If the count of '0's is 6 or more, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not modify the original string `s` or any other variables, and it does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to remove some digits from a binary string such that the remaining number is a positive integer divisible by 64. In binary, a number is divisible by 64 if it has at least 6 trailing zeros (since \(64 = 2^6\)).

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Check for the presence of '1':**
   - If the string does not contain any '1', it is impossible to form a positive integer, so the function prints 'no'.
   - This check is necessary because a string of all zeros is not a valid positive integer.

2. **Find the index of the first '1':**
   - The program finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string.
   - This is done using `s.find('1')`.

3. **Extract the remaining part of the string:**
   - The program extracts the substring starting from the character after the first '1'.
   - This is done using `s[index_of_first_one + 1:]`.

4. **Count the number of trailing zeros:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the remaining substring.
   - This is done using `remaining_string.count('0')`.

5. **Check if there are at least 6 trailing zeros:**
   - If the count of zeros is greater than or equal to 6, the function prints 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

This logic correctly implements the requirement of having at least 6 trailing zeros after the first '1'. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
