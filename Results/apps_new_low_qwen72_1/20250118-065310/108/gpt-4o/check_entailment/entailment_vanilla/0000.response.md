Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to remove some digits from a binary string such that the remaining number is a positive integer divisible by 64. In binary, a number is divisible by 64 if it has at least 6 trailing zeros (since \(64 = 2^6\)).

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Check for the presence of '1':**
   - If the string does not contain any '1', it is impossible to form a positive integer, so the function prints 'no'.
   - This check is necessary because a string of all zeros is not a valid positive integer.

2. **Find the index of the first '1':**
   - The program finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string.
   - This is done using `s.find('1')`.

3. **Extract the remaining part of the string:**
   - The program extracts the substring starting from the character after the first '1'.
   - This is done using `s[index_of_first_one + 1:]`.

4. **Count the number of trailing zeros:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the remaining substring.
   - This is done using `remaining_string.count('0')`.

5. **Check if there are at least 6 trailing zeros:**
   - If the count of zeros is greater than or equal to 6, the function prints 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

This logic correctly implements the requirement of having at least 6 trailing zeros after the first '1'. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
