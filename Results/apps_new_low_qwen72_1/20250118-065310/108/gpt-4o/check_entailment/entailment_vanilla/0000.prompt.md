Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Top-model Izabella participates in the competition. She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.

Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.


-----Input-----

In the only line given a non-empty binary string s with length up to 100.


-----Output-----

Print «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
100010001

Output
yes
Input
100

Output
no


-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can get string 1 000 000 after removing two ones which is a representation of number 64 in the binary numerical system.

# Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    if '1' not in s:
        print('no')
    else:
        index_of_first_one = s.find('1')
        remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]
        count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')
        if count_of_zeros >= 6:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
