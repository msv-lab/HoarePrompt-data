You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Top-model Izabella participates in the competition. She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.

Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.


-----Input-----

In the only line given a non-empty binary string s with length up to 100.


-----Output-----

Print «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
100010001

Output
yes
Input
100

Output
no


-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can get string 1 000 000 after removing two ones which is a representation of number 64 in the binary numerical system.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    if '1' not in s:
        print('no')
    else:
        index_of_first_one = s.find('1')
        remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]
        count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')
        if count_of_zeros >= 6:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a non-empty binary string `s` with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
def func():
    s = input()
    if ('1' not in s) :
        print('no')
    else :
        index_of_first_one = s.find('1')

remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]

count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')
        if (count_of_zeros >= 6) :
            print('yes')
        else :
            print('no')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If `count_of_zeros` is greater than or equal to 6, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count_of_zeros` is less than 6, the function prints 'no' to the console and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input is a non-empty binary string `s` with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. If `s` does not contain the character '1', 'no' is printed. If `s` contains at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', and `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle cases where the binary string has multiple '1's and the necessary six '0's are not contiguous but still exist in the string. For example, consider the input string "1010000010000001":

- The program will find the first '1' at index 0, and then check the substring from index 1 onwards: "010000010000001".
- It will count the zeros in this substring, which is 7, and conclude that the string can be reduced to a number divisible by 64.

However, the correct output for this input should be "no" because there is no way to remove digits to form a number like "1000000" (which is 64 in binary) or any other valid combination that results in a number divisible by 64. The program incorrectly assumes that the zeros need to be contiguous after the first '1', which is not a requirement according to the problem statement.
