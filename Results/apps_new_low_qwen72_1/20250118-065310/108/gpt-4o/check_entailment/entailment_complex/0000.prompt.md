Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Top-model Izabella participates in the competition. She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.

Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.


-----Input-----

In the only line given a non-empty binary string s with length up to 100.


-----Output-----

Print «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
100010001

Output
yes
Input
100

Output
no


-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can get string 1 000 000 after removing two ones which is a representation of number 64 in the binary numerical system.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a non-empty binary string `s` with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
def func():
    s = input()
    if ('1' not in s) :
        print('no')
    else :
        index_of_first_one = s.find('1')

remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]

count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')
        if (count_of_zeros >= 6) :
            print('yes')
        else :
            print('no')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If `count_of_zeros` is greater than or equal to 6, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count_of_zeros` is less than 6, the function prints 'no' to the console and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input is a non-empty binary string `s` with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. If `s` does not contain the character '1', 'no' is printed. If `s` contains at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', and `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If `count_of_zeros` is greater than or equal to 6, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count_of_zeros` is less than 6, the function prints 'no' to the console and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a non-empty binary string `s` from the user input, where each character is either '0' or '1'. It checks if the string contains the character '1'. If the string does not contain '1', it prints 'no' and the function ends. If the string contains at least one '1', it finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' and creates a substring `remaining_string` starting from the character immediately following the first '1'. It then counts the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If the count of '0's is 6 or more, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not modify the original string `s` or any other variables, and it does not return any value.
