### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain cases. Let's break down the issue and the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirement**:
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to remove some digits from the binary string such that the remaining number is a positive integer divisible by 64 in the binary system.
   - A number is divisible by 64 if it has at least 6 trailing zeros in its binary representation.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func` checks if the string contains at least one '1'.
   - If it does, it finds the index of the first '1' and creates a substring starting from the next character.
   - It then counts the number of '0's in this substring.
   - If there are 6 or more '0's in the substring, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

3. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program assumes that the 6 trailing zeros must be contiguous and appear immediately after the first '1'.
   - This assumption is incorrect because the problem does not require the zeros to be contiguous after the first '1'. They can be spread out as long as they are part of the final number after removing some digits.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input string "1010000010000001":
     - The first '1' is at index 0.
     - The substring from index 1 onwards is "010000010000001".
     - The program counts 7 zeros in this substring and concludes 'yes'.
     - However, there is no way to form a number like "1000000" (which is 64 in binary) by removing digits from the original string. The zeros are not contiguous after the first '1'.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to check if there is at least one '1' followed by at least 6 zeros anywhere in the string, not necessarily contiguous.
   - One way to do this is to find all occurrences of '1' and check if any of them have 6 or more zeros following them, regardless of the positions of the zeros.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where the zeros are not contiguous but still meet the requirement of forming a number divisible by 64. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
