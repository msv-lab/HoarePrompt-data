You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Top-model Izabella participates in the competition. She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.

Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.


-----Input-----

In the only line given a non-empty binary string s with length up to 100.


-----Output-----

Print «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
100010001

Output
yes
Input
100

Output
no


-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can get string 1 000 000 after removing two ones which is a representation of number 64 in the binary numerical system.

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    if '1' not in s:
        print('no')
    else:
        index_of_first_one = s.find('1')
        remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]
        count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')
        if count_of_zeros >= 6:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a non-empty binary string `s` from the user input, where each character is either '0' or '1'. It checks if the string contains the character '1'. If the string does not contain '1', it prints 'no' and the function ends. If the string contains at least one '1', it finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' and creates a substring `remaining_string` starting from the character immediately following the first '1'. It then counts the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If the count of '0's is 6 or more, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not modify the original string `s` or any other variables, and it does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle cases where the binary string has multiple '1's and the necessary six '0's are not contiguous but still exist in the string. For example, consider the input string "1010000010000001":

- The program will find the first '1' at index 0, and then check the substring from index 1 onwards: "010000010000001".
- It will count the zeros in this substring, which is 7, and conclude that the string can be reduced to a number divisible by 64.

However, the correct output for this input should be "no" because there is no way to remove digits to form a number like "1000000" (which is 64 in binary) or any other valid combination that results in a number divisible by 64. The program incorrectly assumes that the zeros need to be contiguous after the first '1', which is not a requirement according to the problem statement.
