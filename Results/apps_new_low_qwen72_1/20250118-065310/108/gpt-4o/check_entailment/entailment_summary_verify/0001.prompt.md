You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Top-model Izabella participates in the competition. She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.

Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.


-----Input-----

In the only line given a non-empty binary string s with length up to 100.


-----Output-----

Print «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
100010001

Output
yes
Input
100

Output
no


-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can get string 1 000 000 after removing two ones which is a representation of number 64 in the binary numerical system.

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    if '1' not in s:
        print('no')
    else:
        index_of_first_one = s.find('1')
        remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]
        count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')
        if count_of_zeros >= 6:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a non-empty binary string `s` from the user input, where each character is either '0' or '1'. It checks if the string contains the character '1'. If the string does not contain '1', it prints 'no' and the function ends. If the string contains at least one '1', it finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' and creates a substring `remaining_string` starting from the character immediately following the first '1'. It then counts the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If the count of '0's is 6 or more, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not modify the original string `s` or any other variables, and it does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to remove some digits from a binary string such that the remaining number is a positive integer divisible by 64. In binary, a number is divisible by 64 if it has at least 6 trailing zeros (since \(64 = 2^6\)).

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Check for the presence of '1':**
   - If the string does not contain any '1', it is impossible to form a positive integer, so the function prints 'no'.
   - This check is necessary because a string of all zeros is not a valid positive integer.

2. **Find the index of the first '1':**
   - The program finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string.
   - This is done using `s.find('1')`.

3. **Extract the remaining part of the string:**
   - The program extracts the substring starting from the character after the first '1'.
   - This is done using `s[index_of_first_one + 1:]`.

4. **Count the number of trailing zeros:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the remaining substring.
   - This is done using `remaining_string.count('0')`.

5. **Check if there are at least 6 trailing zeros:**
   - If the count of zeros is greater than or equal to 6, the function prints 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

This logic correctly implements the requirement of having at least 6 trailing zeros after the first '1'. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
