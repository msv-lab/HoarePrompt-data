Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a non-empty binary string `s` from the user input, where each character is either '0' or '1'. It checks if the string contains the character '1'. If the string does not contain '1', it prints 'no' and the function ends. If the string contains at least one '1', it finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' and creates a substring `remaining_string` starting from the character immediately following the first '1'. It then counts the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If the count of '0's is 6 or more, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not modify the original string `s` or any other variables, and it does not return any value. **

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes the input is always a valid non-empty binary string of up to 100 characters. If the input is invalid (e.g., empty, contains characters other than '0' or '1', or exceeds 100 characters), the function's behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where the input is not a string, which could lead to runtime errors.
- The function does not return any value, so any calling code should only rely on the printed output for the result.
