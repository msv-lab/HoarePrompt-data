The provided Python code snippet processes the input binary string `s` by finding the index of the first occurrence of '1', extracting the substring that follows this '1', and then counting the number of '0's in this substring.

- The first line, `index_of_first_one = s.find('1')`, finds the index of the first '1' in the string `s`. Since the initial state guarantees that `s` contains at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` will be a non-negative integer representing the position of the first '1'.
- The second line, `remaining_string = s[index_of_first_one + 1:]`, creates a new string `remaining_string` that starts from the character immediately after the first '1' to the end of the string `s`.
- The third line, `count_of_zeros = remaining_string.count('0')`, counts the number of '0's in `remaining_string`.

Given the initial state and the operations performed, the final state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`**.
