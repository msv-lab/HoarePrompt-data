Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If `count_of_zeros` is greater than or equal to 6, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count_of_zeros` is less than 6, the function prints 'no' to the console and the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
