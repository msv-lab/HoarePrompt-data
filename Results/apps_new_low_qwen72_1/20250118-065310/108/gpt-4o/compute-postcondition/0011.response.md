The function `func` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty binary string with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. However, the provided output section is incomplete, so I cannot fully determine the return value based on the given information. Assuming the function processes this binary string in some way, I will need more specific details about the expected output to accurately describe the functionality.

If you can provide the missing output information, I will be able to complete the description of the function's functionality.

For now, based on the available information:
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty binary string of up to 100 characters, each being '0' or '1'.** 

Please provide the output details to complete the description.
