The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('no')
```

This code prints the string `'no'` to the console. Since this operation does not modify any variables or data structures, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one '1', `index_of_first_one` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, `remaining_string` is the substring of `s` starting right after the first '1', `count_of_zeros` is the number of '0's in `remaining_string`, and `count_of_zeros` is less than 6**.
