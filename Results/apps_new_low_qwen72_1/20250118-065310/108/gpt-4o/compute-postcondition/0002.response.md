The code snippet `print('no')` prints the string `'no'` to the console. This operation does not alter any variables or the state of the program. The initial condition that the string `s` is a non-empty binary string with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', and that the string `s` does not contain the character '1', remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a non-empty binary string `s` with a length of up to 100 characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The string `s` does not contain the character '1'. 'no' is printed.**
