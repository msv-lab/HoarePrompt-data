The function `func` reads a non-empty binary string `s` from the user input, where each character is either '0' or '1'. It checks if the string contains the character '1'. If the string does not contain '1', it prints 'no' and the function ends. If the string contains at least one '1', it finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' and creates a substring `remaining_string` starting from the character immediately following the first '1'. It then counts the number of '0's in `remaining_string`. If the count of '0's is 6 or more, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not modify the original string `s` or any other variables, and it does not return any value.
