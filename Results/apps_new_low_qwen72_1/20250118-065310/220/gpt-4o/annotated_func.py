    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is a list of strings representing the sequence of actions (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If `current_position` is less than `m`, `result` includes an additional string `'RUN {m - current_position}'`, and the loop does not execute if `n` is 0 or if any obstacle is within `s` distance of the current position, causing an immediate return of 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If `current_position` is not less than `m`, the loop does not execute further and the function continues as per the logic outside the if-else block.
    return '\n'.join(result)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining all elements in the list `result` with newline characters. Each element in `result` represents an action (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If the loop did not execute due to `n` being 0 or an obstacle being within `s` distance of the current position, the function would have returned 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If `current_position` is less than `m`, the last element in `result` is `'RUN {m - current_position}'`. The exact content of `result` depends on the sequence of actions taken during the navigation process.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes five parameters: `n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, and `obstacles`. It aims to navigate through a series of obstacles represented by the list `obstacles` on a path of length `m` starting from position 0. The function returns a sequence of actions (either "RUN" or "JUMP") required to reach the end of the path without hitting any obstacles. If it is impossible to navigate through the obstacles under the given constraints, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. 

Here are the key points about the function's behavior:
