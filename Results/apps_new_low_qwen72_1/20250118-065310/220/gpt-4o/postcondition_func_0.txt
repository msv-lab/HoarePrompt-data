The function `func_1` takes five parameters: `n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, and `obstacles`. It aims to navigate through a series of obstacles represented by the list `obstacles` on a path of length `m` starting from position 0. The function returns a sequence of actions (either "RUN" or "JUMP") required to reach the end of the path without hitting any obstacles. If it is impossible to navigate through the obstacles under the given constraints, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. 

Here are the key points about the function's behavior:
