### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Check:**
   - The program reads input correctly and initializes variables.
   - It sorts the obstacles, ensuring they are processed in the correct order.
   - The initial check ensures that the first obstacle is not too close to the start (less than `s` meters away), which would make it impossible to jump over it.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates through each obstacle, checking if the athlete can run up to the obstacle and then jump over it.
   - If the distance between the current position and the next obstacle is less than `s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE' because the athlete cannot perform a valid jump.
   - The program calculates the run length and appends the corresponding 'RUN' command to the result.
   - It then determines the end of the jump, considering any consecutive obstacles that can be jumped over in a single jump.
   - The jump length is checked to ensure it does not exceed `d`. If it does, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
   - The current position is updated after each run and jump.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all obstacles, the program checks if the athlete needs to run the remaining distance to the finish line.
   - If so, it appends the final 'RUN' command to the result.
   - The result is then returned as a string with each action on a new line.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the constraints and edge cases correctly. It ensures that the athlete can only jump over obstacles and that the jumps and runs are within the specified limits. The logic for handling consecutive obstacles and the final run to the finish line is also correct.

**Correctness: **True****

The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.
