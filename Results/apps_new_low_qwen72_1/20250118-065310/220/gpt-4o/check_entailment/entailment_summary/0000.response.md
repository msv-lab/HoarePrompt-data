Reasoning:  
- The function correctly sorts the obstacles, ensuring they are processed in the correct order.
- The function checks if the first obstacle is too close to the start (less than `s` meters away). If so, it returns 'IMPOSSIBLE', which is correct because the sportsman cannot start a jump if there is an obstacle within the minimum run distance.
- For each obstacle, the function calculates the run length before the jump, ensuring the sportsman has enough space to run before jumping over the obstacle. If there isn't enough space, it returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
- The function also checks if the next obstacle(s) can be jumped over in a single jump by extending the jump end to the farthest possible obstacle within the jump distance. This ensures that the sportsman can clear multiple obstacles in one jump if possible.
- After calculating the jump length, the function checks if the jump length exceeds the maximum jump distance `d`. If so, it returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
- If the sportsman successfully navigates all obstacles and reaches a position less than `m`, the function appends a final run command to reach the finish line.
- The function returns the sequence of actions as a string, or 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the sportsman cannot complete the course.

Based on the above reasoning, the function appears to handle all edge cases and constraints correctly.

Correctness: **True**
