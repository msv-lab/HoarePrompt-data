You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A sportsman starts from point x_{start} = 0 and runs to point with coordinate x_{finish} = m (on a straight line). Also, the sportsman can jump — to jump, he should first take a run of length of not less than s meters (in this case for these s meters his path should have no obstacles), and after that he can jump over a length of not more than d meters. Running and jumping is permitted only in the direction from left to right. He can start andfinish a jump only at the points with integer coordinates in which there are no obstacles. To overcome some obstacle, it is necessary to land at a point which is strictly to the right of this obstacle.

On the way of an athlete are n obstacles at coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}. He cannot go over the obstacles, he can only jump over them. Your task is to determine whether the athlete will be able to get to the finish point.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containsd four integers n, m, s and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ s, d ≤ 10^9) — the number of obstacles on the runner's way, the coordinate of the finishing point, the length of running before the jump and the maximum length of the jump, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ m - 1) — the coordinates of the obstacles. It is guaranteed that the starting and finishing point have no obstacles, also no point can have more than one obstacle, The coordinates of the obstacles are given in an arbitrary order.


-----Output-----

If the runner cannot reach the finishing point, print in the first line of the output "IMPOSSIBLE" (without the quotes).

If the athlete can get from start to finish, print any way to do this in the following format:  print a line of form "RUN X>" (where "X" should be a positive integer), if the athlete should run for "X" more meters;  print a line of form "JUMP Y" (where "Y" should be a positive integer), if the sportsman starts a jump and should remain in air for "Y" more meters. 

All commands "RUN" and "JUMP" should strictly alternate, starting with "RUN", besides, they should be printed chronologically. It is not allowed to jump over the finishing point but it is allowed to land there after a jump. The athlete should stop as soon as he reaches finish.

If `current_position` is not less than `m`, the loop does not execute further and the function continues as per the logic outside the if-else block.

    #The program returns a string formed by joining all elements in the list `result` with newline characters. Each element in `result` represents an action (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If the loop did not execute due to `n` being 0 or an obstacle being within `s` distance of the current position, the function would have returned 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If `current_position` is less than `m`, the last element in `result` is `'RUN {m - current_position}'`. The exact content of `result` depends on the sequence of actions taken during the navigation process.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has an issue with how it handles the last segment of the run. Specifically, the check `if current_position >= m:` returns 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the current position is exactly at the finish line, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The athlete should be able to stop at the finish line without returning 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 5 1 3
4
```
The expected output should be:
```
RUN 3
JUMP 1
```
However, the program will incorrectly return 'IMPOSSIBLE' because it checks `if current_position >= m:` after the last jump, which causes the program to return 'IMPOSSIBLE' when the current position is exactly at the finish line.

To fix this, the check should be adjusted to only return 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the current position exceeds the finish line.
