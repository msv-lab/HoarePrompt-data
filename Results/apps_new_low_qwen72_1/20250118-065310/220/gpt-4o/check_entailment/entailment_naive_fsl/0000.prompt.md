You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A sportsman starts from point x_{start} = 0 and runs to point with coordinate x_{finish} = m (on a straight line). Also, the sportsman can jump — to jump, he should first take a run of length of not less than s meters (in this case for these s meters his path should have no obstacles), and after that he can jump over a length of not more than d meters. Running and jumping is permitted only in the direction from left to right. He can start andfinish a jump only at the points with integer coordinates in which there are no obstacles. To overcome some obstacle, it is necessary to land at a point which is strictly to the right of this obstacle.

On the way of an athlete are n obstacles at coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}. He cannot go over the obstacles, he can only jump over them. Your task is to determine whether the athlete will be able to get to the finish point.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containsd four integers n, m, s and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ s, d ≤ 10^9) — the number of obstacles on the runner's way, the coordinate of the finishing point, the length of running before the jump and the maximum length of the jump, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ m - 1) — the coordinates of the obstacles. It is guaranteed that the starting and finishing point have no obstacles, also no point can have more than one obstacle, The coordinates of the obstacles are given in an arbitrary order.


-----Output-----

If the runner cannot reach the finishing point, print in the first line of the output "IMPOSSIBLE" (without the quotes).

If the athlete can get from start to finish, print any way to do this in the following format:  print a line of form "RUN X>" (where "X" should be a positive integer), if the athlete should run for "X" more meters;  print a line of form "JUMP Y" (where "Y" should be a positive integer), if the sportsman starts a jump and should remain in air for "Y" more meters. 

All commands "RUN" and "JUMP" should strictly alternate, starting with "RUN", besides, they should be printed chronologically. It is not allowed to jump over the finishing point but it is allowed to land there after a jump. The athlete should stop as soon as he reaches finish.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 1 3
3 4 7

Output
RUN 2
JUMP 3
RUN 1
JUMP 2
RUN 2

Input
2 9 2 3
6 4

Output
IMPOSSIBLE
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    s = int(data[2])
    d = int(data[3])
    obstacles = list(map(int, data[4:]))
    result = func_1(n, m, s, d, obstacles)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, s, d, obstacles):
    obstacles.sort()
    if obstacles[0] < s:
        return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    result = []
    current_position = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if obstacles[i] - current_position < s:
            return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
        run_length = obstacles[i] - s - current_position
        if run_length > 0:
            result.append(f'RUN {run_length}')
            current_position += run_length
        jump_end = obstacles[i]
        while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
            jump_end = obstacles[i + 1]
            i += 1
        jump_length = jump_end - current_position
        if jump_length > d:
            return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
        result.append(f'JUMP {jump_length}')
        current_position += jump_length
        if current_position >= m:
            return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    if current_position < m:
        result.append(f'RUN {m - current_position}')
    return '\n'.join(result)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
