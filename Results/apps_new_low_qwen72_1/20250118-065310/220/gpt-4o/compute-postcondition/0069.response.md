The provided code appends a string to the `result` list and updates the `current_position` based on the `jump_length`. Here's the detailed analysis and the resulting output state:

- The first line appends a formatted string to the `result` list, which includes the value of `jump_length`.
- The second line increments `current_position` by the value of `jump_length`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the maximum index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d`.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique.
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` remains unchanged.
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`.
- `current_position` remains the same.
- `jump_length` is `obstacles[i] - current_position`.
- `current_position` is less than `m`.
- `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`.
- If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
- `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`.

After executing the code:
- `result` now includes the string `'JUMP {jump_length}'`.
- `current_position` is incremented by `jump_length`.
