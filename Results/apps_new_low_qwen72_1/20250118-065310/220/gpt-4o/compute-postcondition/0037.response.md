The provided code snippet updates the value of `jump_end` to the next obstacle in the list and increments the index `i` by 1. Let's break down the combined effect of these changes on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is less than `n - 1`
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^9
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`
- `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)]`
- `current_position` is `current_position + run_length` if `run_length` > 0, otherwise `current_position` remains unchanged
- `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`
- `jump_length` is `obstacles[k]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `jump_length` is `obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s`, and `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`
- `current_position` is less than `m`
- If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the state unchanged.

### Code Execution:
1. `jump_end = obstacles[i + 1]`
   - This line updates `jump_end` to the value of the next obstacle in the list.
   - Given that `i` is less than `n - 1`, `i + 1` is a valid index within the `obstacles` list.
   - Therefore, `jump_end` is now set to the value of `obstacles[i + 1]`.

2. `i += 1`
   - This line increments the index `i` by 1.
   - After this line, `i` is now `i + 1`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `i` is now `i + 1` (where the original `i` was less than `n - 1`)
- `m` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9
- `s` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9
- `d` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^9
- `obstacles` remains a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique
- The first element of `obstacles` remains greater than or equal to `s`
- `result` remains the same as before
- `current_position` remains the same as before
- `run_length` remains the same as before
- `jump_end` is now `obstacles[i + 1]`
- `jump_length` remains the same as before
- `current_position` remains less than `m`
- The condition `obstacles[i] - current_position < s` is not checked here, so no 'IMPOSSIBLE' return occurs.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)], current_position is current_position + run_length if run_length > 0, otherwise current_position remains unchanged, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i + 1], jump_length is obstacles[k] if run_length is 0, otherwise jump_length is obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, current_position is less than m**
