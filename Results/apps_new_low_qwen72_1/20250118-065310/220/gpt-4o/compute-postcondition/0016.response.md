To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
```

### Conditions Breakdown:
1. **Condition 1**: `i + 1 < n`
   - This condition ensures that there is at least one more element in the `obstacles` list to check.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2).

2. **Condition 2**: `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`
   - This condition checks if the next obstacle in the list is within the reach defined by `jump_end + d`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2. The value of `obstacles[2]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[1]`

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: To ensure `i + 1 < n`, `n` must be greater than 2.
- **`obstacles[2]`**: To ensure `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`, `obstacles[2]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is an empty list if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length)]`, `current_position` is 0 if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `current_position` is `run_length`, `run_length` is `obstacles[0] - s`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[1]`, and `obstacles[2]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`**
