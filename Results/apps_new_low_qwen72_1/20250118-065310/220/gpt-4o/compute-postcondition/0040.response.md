To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i + 1 < n`**
   - This condition checks if there is at least one more element in the `obstacles` list to process.
   - To ensure this condition holds true for another iteration, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`**
   - This condition checks if the next obstacle in the list is within the reachable distance from the current jump end.
   - To ensure this condition holds true for another iteration, `obstacles[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The variable `i` should be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute again.
- **`obstacles[i + 1]`**: The value of `obstacles[i + 1]` should be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Given State:
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `obstacles[i + 1]` is the next element in the `obstacles` list.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is already incremented, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n`.
- We need to ensure that `obstacles[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)], `current_position` is `current_position + run_length` if `run_length > 0`, otherwise `current_position` remains unchanged, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i + 1]`, `jump_length` is `obstacles[k]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `jump_length` is `obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s`, `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`, `current_position` is less than `m`, `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`, and `i + 1 < n`**
