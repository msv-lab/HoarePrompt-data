The provided code initializes two new variables, `result` and `current_position`. The variable `result` is initialized as an empty list, and `current_position` is set to 0. This initialization does not alter the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, or the list `obstacles`, which remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is [], current_position is 0**
