Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last index k such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition), `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is an empty list if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length)]`, `current_position` is 0 if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `current_position` is `run_length`, `run_length` is `obstacles[0] - s`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[k]` (where k is the last index satisfying the loop condition), `jump_length` is `obstacles[k]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `jump_length` is `obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s`. Additionally, the current value of `jump_length` is greater than `d`.***
