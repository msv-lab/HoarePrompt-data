The provided code snippet updates the `jump_end` variable to the value of `obstacles[i + 1]` and then increments `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, let's determine the final state after executing this code.

### Initial Conditions:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique.
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` is an empty list if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length)]`.
- `current_position` is 0 if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `current_position` is `run_length`.
- `run_length` is `obstacles[0] - s`.
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[2]`.
- `obstacles[3]` must be less than or equal to `obstacles[2] + d`.

### Code Execution:
1. `jump_end = obstacles[i + 1]`
   - `i` is initially 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
   - Therefore, `jump_end` is set to `obstacles[3]`.

2. `i += 1`
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 3 (unchanged).
- `i` is 3 (updated from 2 to 3).
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 (unchanged).
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9 (unchanged).
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9 (unchanged).
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique (unchanged).
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s` (unchanged).
- `result` is an empty list if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length)]` (unchanged).
- `current_position` is 0 if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `current_position` is `run_length` (unchanged).
- `run_length` is `obstacles[0] - s` (unchanged).
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[3]` (updated from `obstacles[2]` to `obstacles[3]`).
