The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, and `obstacles`. 

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of obstacles.
- `m` is an integer where 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, representing the total distance to cover.
- `s` is an integer where 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, representing the maximum safe distance from any obstacle.
- `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, representing the jump distance.
- `obstacles` is a list of `n` unique integers, each satisfying 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1, representing the positions of the obstacles.

The function returns:
- **'IMPOSSIBLE'** in multiple cases, which collectively mean that the task cannot be completed due to various constraints or conditions not being met.
- A string formed by joining all elements in the list `result` with newline characters, where each element in `result` represents an action (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If `n` is 0 or an obstacle is within `s` distance of the current position, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If the navigation process completes successfully and `current_position` is less than `m`, the last element in `result` is `'RUN {m - current_position}'`.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters `n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, and `obstacles`. It returns 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the task cannot be completed due to various constraints. Otherwise, it returns a string representing a sequence of actions (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles, with the final action ensuring the total distance `m` is covered.**
