The provided code snippet updates the value of `jump_end` to the next obstacle in the list and increments the index `i` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of these changes on the program state:

1. `jump_end = obstacles[i + 1]`: This line updates `jump_end` to the value of the next obstacle in the list `obstacles`.
2. `i += 1`: This line increments the index `i` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is such that `i + 1 < n`.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique.
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` remains unchanged.
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[i + 1]`.
- `current_position` remains the same.
- If `run_length` is 0, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`.
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`.
- `jump_length` is `jump_end - current_position`.
- `current_position` is less than `m`.
- `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`.
- If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

After executing the code:
- `jump_end` is updated to `obstacles[i + 1]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state is:

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result remains unchanged, jump_end is obstacles[i], current_position remains the same, if run_length is 0, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i], jump_length is jump_end - current_position, current_position is less than m, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, if obstacles[i] - current_position < s, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'**
