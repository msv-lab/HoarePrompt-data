The provided code snippet updates the `jump_end` and `i` variables based on the current state of the `obstacles` list and the index `i`.

- The first line updates `jump_end` to the value of `obstacles[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `jump_end` is updated to the value of `obstacles[1]`.
- The second line increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the final state after executing the code is:

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is an empty list if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length)], current_position is 0 if run_length is 0, otherwise current_position is run_length, run_length is obstacles[0] - s, jump_end is obstacles[1]**
