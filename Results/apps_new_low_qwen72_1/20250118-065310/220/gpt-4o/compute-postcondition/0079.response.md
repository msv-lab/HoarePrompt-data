Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes five parameters: `n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, and `obstacles`. It aims to navigate through a series of obstacles represented by the list `obstacles` on a path of length `m` starting from position 0. The function returns a sequence of actions (either "RUN" or "JUMP") required to reach the end of the path without hitting any obstacles. If it is impossible to navigate through the obstacles under the given constraints, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. 

Here are the key points about the function's behavior:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function checks if the first obstacle is before the starting position `s`. If it is, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
   - The function also ensures that the obstacles are sorted in ascending order.

2. **Navigation Logic**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of obstacles.
   - For each obstacle, it calculates the distance to the next obstacle and determines whether to "RUN" or "JUMP".
   - If the distance to the next obstacle is less than `s`, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
   - If a "JUMP" is necessary, the function checks if the jump length exceeds `d`. If it does, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
   - The function updates the `current_position` based on the actions taken and ensures that the `current_position` does not exceed `m`.

3. **Final Position Check**:
   - After the loop, if the `current_position` is still less than `m`, the function appends a final "RUN" action to cover the remaining distance to `m`.
   - The function then returns a string formed by joining all elements in the `result` list with newline characters.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0 (i.e., no obstacles), the function will return a sequence of actions to cover the entire distance `m` using "RUN" actions.
   - If any obstacle is within `s` distance of the current position, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
   - If the distance between consecutive obstacles is too large to be covered by a single jump of length `d`, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
   - If the `current_position` exceeds `m` at any point, the function returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

In summary, the function returns a sequence of actions to navigate through the obstacles or 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the task cannot be completed under the given constraints. **
