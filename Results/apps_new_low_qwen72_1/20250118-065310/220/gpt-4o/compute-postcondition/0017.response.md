The provided code snippet updates the `jump_end` and `i` variables based on the current state of `obstacles` and `i`. Initially, `i` is 1, and `jump_end` is set to `obstacles[1]`. The code then updates `jump_end` to the next obstacle in the list (i.e., `obstacles[2]`) and increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The rest of the variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, `obstacles`, `result`, `current_position`, `run_length`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is an empty list if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length)], current_position is 0 if run_length is 0, otherwise current_position is run_length, run_length is obstacles[0] - s, jump_end is obstacles[2], and obstacles[2] must be less than or equal to jump_end + d**
