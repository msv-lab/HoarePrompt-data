The provided code updates the `jump_end` to the next obstacle in the `obstacles` list and increments the index `i` by 1. Given the initial state, these changes affect the following variables:

- `jump_end` is updated to `obstacles[i + 1]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, `obstacles`, `result`, `current_position`, `run_length`, `jump_length`) remain unchanged unless they are indirectly affected by the changes in `jump_end` or `i`.

Since the exact values of `i` and `obstacles` are not specified, we can only state the changes in terms of their symbolic representation.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result remains unchanged, jump_end is obstacles[i + 1], current_position remains the same, if run_length is 0, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i], jump_length is jump_end - current_position, current_position is less than m, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, if obstacles[i] - current_position < s, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'**.
