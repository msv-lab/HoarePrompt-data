The provided code snippet updates the `jump_end` to the value of the next obstacle in the `obstacles` list (`obstacles[i + 1]`) and increments the index `i` by 1. This affects the state of the program by changing the values of `jump_end` and `i`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the next index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition).
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique.
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` is a list of strings formatted based on `run_length` and `jump_length`.
- If `run_length` > 0, `current_position` is updated to `current_position + run_length`.
- If `run_length` is 0, `run_length` is set to `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is set to `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` is set to `jump_end - current_position`, and `current_position` is less than `m` and `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`.
- If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

After executing the code:
- `jump_end` is now `obstacles[i + 1]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The final state is:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique.
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` remains unchanged unless further modified by subsequent code.
- `jump_end` is now `obstacles[i + 1]`.
- `current_position` remains the same unless further modified by subsequent code.
- If `run_length` is 0, `run_length` is still `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is still `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` is still `jump_end - current_position`, and `current_position` is less than `m` and `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`.
- If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
