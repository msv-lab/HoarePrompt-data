To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1:** `i + 1 < n`
   - This condition checks if there is at least one more element in the `obstacles` list to process.
   - To satisfy this condition, `i` should be less than `n - 1`.

2. **Condition 2:** `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`
   - This condition checks if the next obstacle in the list is within the reachable distance from the current `jump_end`.
   - To satisfy this condition, `obstacles[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `i + 1` (from the previous iteration).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m`, `s`, `d`, and `obstacles` are as described.
- `current_position` is updated based on `run_length`.
- `run_length`, `jump_end`, and `jump_length` are calculated based on the current state.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
- `obstacles[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

Given the current state, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1` and that the next obstacle in the list (`obstacles[i + 1]`) is within the reachable distance from `jump_end`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1` and `i + 1 < n`, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)], `current_position` is `current_position + run_length` if `run_length > 0`, otherwise `current_position` remains unchanged, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i + 1]`, `jump_length` is `obstacles[k]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `jump_length` is `obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s`, and `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`, `current_position` is less than `m`, and `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`**
