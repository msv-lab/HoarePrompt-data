Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The code snippet `jump_end = obstacles[i]` updates the value of `jump_end` to be the value of the element in the `obstacles` list at index `i`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `jump_end` is now updated to `obstacles[i]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition) + 1, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)]`, `current_position` is `current_position + run_length` if `run_length` > 0, otherwise `current_position` remains unchanged, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` is `obstacles[k]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `jump_length` is `obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s`, and `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`, and `current_position` is less than `m`. If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the state unchanged.**
Code of the loop:
while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
    jump_end = obstacles[i + 1]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)], current_position is current_position + run_length if run_length > 0, otherwise current_position remains unchanged, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i + 1], jump_length is obstacles[k] if run_length is 0, otherwise jump_length is obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, current_position is less than m
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)], current_position is current_position + run_length if run_length > 0, otherwise current_position remains unchanged, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i + 1], jump_length is obstacles[k] if run_length is 0, otherwise jump_length is obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s, jump_length is less than or equal to d, current_position is less than m, obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)], current_position is current_position + run_length if run_length > 0, otherwise current_position remains unchanged, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i + 1], jump_length is obstacles[k] if run_length is 0, otherwise jump_length is obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s, jump_length is less than or equal to d, current_position is less than m, obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d, and i + 1 < n


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
