Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is a list of strings representing the sequence of actions (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles, current_position is the sum of all run and jump lengths, the loop has executed n times, and current_position is less than m unless the loop encountered a condition causing it to return 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The loop does not execute if n is 0 or if any obstacle is within s distance of the current position, causing an immediate return of 'IMPOSSIBLE'.**
