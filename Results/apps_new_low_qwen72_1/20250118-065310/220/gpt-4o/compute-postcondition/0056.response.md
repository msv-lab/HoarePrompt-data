Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the next index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition), `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)]. If `run_length` > 0, `current_position` is updated to `current_position + run_length`, and the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition. If `run_length` is 0, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition, including `run_length` being `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` being `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` being `jump_end - current_position`, `current_position` being less than `m`, and `jump_length` being less than or equal to `d`. If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.***
