To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to start its first iteration.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`
- `result` is an empty list
- `current_position` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
- The loop index `i` starts at 0.
- The other variables (`m`, `s`, `d`, `obstacles`, `result`, `current_position`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to start, but they are part of the initial state.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0 (as it is the starting index of the loop).

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is an empty list, `current_position` is 0**
