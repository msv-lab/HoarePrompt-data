To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **Condition 1:** `i + 1 < n`
   - This condition ensures that there is at least one more element in the `obstacles` list to consider. If this condition is not met, the loop will terminate.

2. **Condition 2:** `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`
   - This condition ensures that the next obstacle in the list is within the range that the player can jump to from the current position.

### Current State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique.
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` remains unchanged.
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[i + 1]`.
- `current_position` remains the same.
- If `run_length` is 0, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` is `jump_end - current_position`.
- `current_position` is less than `m`.
- `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`.
- If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Adjust `i`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the loop, the next iteration will use `i + 1` as the new `i`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 to ensure the loop can proceed.

2. **Check `n`**:
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 to ensure there are elements in the `obstacles` list. Since `i` is incremented, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to continue.

3. **Check `obstacles[i + 1]`**:
   - The next element in the `obstacles` list, `obstacles[i + 1]`, must be within the range `jump_end + d`.

### Conclusion:
- The variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `obstacles[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

Given these adjustments, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be modified as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` remains unchanged, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i + 1]`, `current_position` remains the same, if `run_length` is 0, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` is `jump_end - current_position`, `current_position` is less than `m`, and `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`, if `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.**
