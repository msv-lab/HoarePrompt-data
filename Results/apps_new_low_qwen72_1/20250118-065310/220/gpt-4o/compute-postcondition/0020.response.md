Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is the last index k such that obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d (or n-1 if all elements satisfy this condition), m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is an empty list if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length)], current_position is 0 if run_length is 0, otherwise current_position is run_length, run_length is obstacles[0] - s, jump_end is obstacles[k] (where k is the last index satisfying the loop condition).**

Explanation:
- **Invariant Variables**: `n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, `obstacles`, `result`, `current_position`, and `run_length` remain unchanged throughout the loop. The only variable that changes within the loop is `i` and `jump_end`.
- **Loop Behavior**: The loop increments `i` and updates `jump_end` to `obstacles[i + 1]` as long as `i + 1` is less than `n` and `obstacles[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `jump_end + d`. This continues until either `i + 1` reaches `n` or the condition `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d` fails.
- **Final State**:
  - `i` will be the last index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d`.
  - `jump_end` will be `obstacles[k]` where `k` is the last index satisfying the loop condition.
  - If all elements in `obstacles` satisfy the loop condition, `i` will be `n-1` and `jump_end` will be `obstacles[n-1]`.
- **Conditions for Execution**:
  - The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or if the first obstacle is already out of reach (`obstacles[0] > s + d`).
  - The loop will execute at least once if `n > 1` and `obstacles[1] <= obstacles[0] + d`.
  - The loop will stop executing when it finds an obstacle that cannot be reached within the next `d` distance from the current `jump_end`.
