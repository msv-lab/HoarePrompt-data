Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is the next index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition), `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)]. If `run_length` > 0, `current_position` is updated to `current_position + run_length`, and the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition. If `run_length` is 0, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition, including `run_length` being `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` being `jump_end - current_position`, `current_position` being less than `m`, and `jump_length` being less than or equal to `d`. If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
Code of the loop:
while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
    jump_end = obstacles[i + 1]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result remains unchanged, jump_end is obstacles[i + 1], current_position remains the same, if run_length is 0, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i], jump_length is jump_end - current_position, current_position is less than m, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, if obstacles[i] - current_position < s, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result remains unchanged, jump_end is obstacles[i + 1], current_position remains the same, if run_length is 0, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i], jump_length is jump_end - current_position, current_position is less than m, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, if obstacles[i] - current_position < s, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result remains unchanged, jump_end is obstacles[i], current_position remains the same, if run_length is 0, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i], jump_length is jump_end - current_position, current_position is less than m, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, if obstacles[i] - current_position < s, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
