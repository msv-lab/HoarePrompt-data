To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **Condition 1:** `i + 1 < n`
   - This condition checks if there are more elements in the `obstacles` list to process. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

2. **Condition 2:** `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`
   - This condition checks if the next obstacle in the list is within the reachable distance from `jump_end`. For the loop to continue, `obstacles[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Current State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique.
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` is an empty list if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length)]`.
- `current_position` is 0 if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `current_position` is `run_length`.
- `run_length` is `obstacles[0] - s`.
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[2]`.
- `obstacles[2]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Adjust `i` to ensure `i + 1 < n`:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, `i + 1` is 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3. This condition is already satisfied because `n` is greater than 2.

2. **Adjust `obstacles[i + 1]` to ensure `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`:**
   - Currently, `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. We need to ensure that `obstacles[3]` is less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.
   - Given that `jump_end` is `obstacles[2]`, the condition becomes `obstacles[3] <= obstacles[2] + d`.

### Final State:
Since `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2, `i + 1` (which is 3) is less than `n`. Therefore, the first condition is already satisfied. The second condition requires that `obstacles[3]` must be less than or equal to `obstacles[2] + d`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- Ensure that `obstacles[3]` is less than or equal to `obstacles[2] + d`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is an empty list if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length)]`, `current_position` is 0 if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `current_position` is `run_length`, `run_length` is `obstacles[0] - s`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[2]`, and `obstacles[3]` must be less than or equal to `obstacles[2] + d`**
