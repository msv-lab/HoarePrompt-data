The code snippet assigns the value of `jump_end - current_position` to `jump_length`. Based on the initial state:

- `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`.
- `current_position` remains the same.
- `jump_length` is now calculated as `obstacles[i] - current_position`.

The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is the maximum index k such that obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result remains unchanged, jump_end is obstacles[i], current_position remains the same, jump_length is obstacles[i] - current_position, current_position is less than m, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, if obstacles[i] - current_position < s, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.**
