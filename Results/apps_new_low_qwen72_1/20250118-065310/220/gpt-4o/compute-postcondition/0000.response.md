The code snippet `obstacles.sort()` sorts the list `obstacles` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `obstacles` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **n, m, s, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ s, d ≤ 10^9. `obstacles` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1, and all a_i are unique.**
