To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i + 1 < n`**
   - This condition ensures that there is at least one more element in the `obstacles` list after the current index `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d`**
   - This condition checks if the next obstacle in the list (`obstacles[i + 1]`) is within the range of the current `jump_end` plus `d`.
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `obstacles[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `jump_end` is updated to `obstacles[i]`.
- `i` is the last index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition) + 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique.
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)]`.
- `current_position` is `current_position + run_length` if `run_length` > 0, otherwise `current_position` remains unchanged.
- `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`.
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`.
- `jump_length` is `obstacles[k]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `jump_length` is `obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s`.
- `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`.
- `current_position` is less than `m`.

### Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- `i` must be less than `n - 1` to ensure there is a next element in the list.
- `obstacles[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the loop will execute if:
- `i` is less than `n - 1`.
- `obstacles[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `jump_end + d`.

Since `i` is already defined as the last index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition) + 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1` and that the next element in the list satisfies the condition.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)]`, `current_position` is `current_position + run_length` if `run_length` > 0, otherwise `current_position` remains unchanged, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` is `obstacles[k]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `jump_length` is `obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s`, and `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`, and `current_position` is less than `m`. If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the state unchanged.**
