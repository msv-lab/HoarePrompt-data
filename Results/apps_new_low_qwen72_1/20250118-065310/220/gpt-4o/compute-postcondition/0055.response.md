The provided code snippet appends a string to the `result` list and updates the `current_position` by adding the `run_length` to it. Here's the detailed impact of the code on the state:

- The first line appends the string `'RUN ' + str(run_length)` to the `result` list. This means the `result` list now includes an additional element that describes a run action with the length specified by `run_length`.
- The second line updates the `current_position` by adding `run_length` to its current value. This effectively moves the character forward by `run_length`.

Given the initial state, let's summarize the final state:

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains the next index k such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition).
- `m` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `s` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
- `d` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `obstacles` remains a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, and the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `result` is updated to include the new element `'RUN ' + str(run_length)`.
- `current_position` is updated to `current_position + run_length`.
- `run_length` remains `obstacles[i] - s - current_position` (calculated before the code execution).
- `jump_end` remains `obstacles[i]`.
- `jump_length` remains `jump_end - current_position` (calculated before the code execution).
- `current_position` is less than `m`.
- `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`.
- If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated state.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is the next index k such that obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d (or n-1 if all elements satisfy this condition), m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)] if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)], current_position is current_position + run_length, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i], jump_length is jump_end - current_position, current_position is less than m, jump_length is less than or equal to d, and if obstacles[i] - current_position < s, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.**
