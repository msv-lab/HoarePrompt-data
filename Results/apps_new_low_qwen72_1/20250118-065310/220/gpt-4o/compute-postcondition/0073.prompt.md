Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is [], current_position is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if obstacles[i] - current_position < s:
        return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    run_length = obstacles[i] - s - current_position
    if run_length > 0:
        result.append(f'RUN {run_length}')
        current_position += run_length
    jump_end = obstacles[i]
    while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
        jump_end = obstacles[i + 1]
        i += 1
    jump_length = jump_end - current_position
    if jump_length > d:
        return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    result.append(f'JUMP {jump_length}')
    current_position += jump_length
    if current_position >= m:
        return 'IMPOSSIBLE'


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: n is greater than 0, i is the last index k such that obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d (or n-1 if all elements satisfy this condition), m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)], current_position is current_position + jump_length, run_length is obstacles[0] - s, jump_end is obstacles[k], jump_length is obstacles[k] if run_length is 0, otherwise jump_length is obstacles[k] - obstacles[0] + s, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, and current_position is less than m.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is greater than 0, i is the last index k such that obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d (or n-1 if all elements satisfy this condition), m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if run_length is 0, otherwise result is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)], current_position is current_position + jump_length, run_length is obstacles[i] - s - current_position, jump_end is obstacles[i], jump_length is jump_end - current_position, current_position is less than m, and jump_length is less than or equal to d, and current_position is less than m
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is greater than 0, i is the maximum index k such that obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is [previous values, 'JUMP {jump_length}'], jump_end is obstacles[i], current_position is current_position + jump_length, jump_length is obstacles[i] - current_position, current_position is less than m, jump_length is less than or equal to d, if obstacles[i] - current_position < s, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE', and jump_length is less than or equal to d, and current_position is less than m


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
