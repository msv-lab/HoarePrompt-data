The code snippet updates the value of `run_length` based on the given formula `run_length = obstacles[i] - s - current_position`.

Given the Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is the next index k such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition)
- `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9
- `obstacles` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique
- The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`
- `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)]
- `current_position` is `current_position + jump_length`
- `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`
- `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`
- `jump_length` is `jump_end - current_position`
- `current_position` is less than `m`
- `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`
- If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.

The code snippet `run_length = obstacles[i] - s - current_position` updates the value of `run_length` to the new value calculated by the expression `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the next index k such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition), `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)] if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is ['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)], `current_position` is `current_position + jump_length`, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` is `jump_end - current_position`, `current_position` is less than `m`, `jump_length` is less than or equal to `d`, and if `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.**
