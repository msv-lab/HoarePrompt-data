The value of `jump_length` is updated to `jump_end - current_position`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last index `k` such that `obstacles[k] <= jump_end + d` (or `n-1` if all elements satisfy this condition), `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `m - 1` and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length)]` if `run_length` is 0, otherwise `result` is `['RUN ' + str(run_length), 'JUMP ' + str(jump_length), 'RUN ' + str(run_length)]`, `current_position` is `current_position + run_length` if `run_length` > 0, otherwise `current_position` remains unchanged, `run_length` is `obstacles[i] - s - current_position`, `jump_end` is `obstacles[i]`, `jump_length` is `jump_end - current_position`, `current_position` is less than `m`. If `obstacles[i] - current_position < s`, the program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the state unchanged.**
