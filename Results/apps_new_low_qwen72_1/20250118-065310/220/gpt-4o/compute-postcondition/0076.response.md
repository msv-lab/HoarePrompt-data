Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is a list of strings representing the sequence of actions (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If `current_position` is less than `m`, `result` includes an additional string `'RUN {m - current_position}'`, and the loop does not execute if `n` is 0 or if any obstacle is within `s` distance of the current position, causing an immediate return of 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If `current_position` is not less than `m`, the loop does not execute further and the function continues as per the logic outside the if-else block.***
