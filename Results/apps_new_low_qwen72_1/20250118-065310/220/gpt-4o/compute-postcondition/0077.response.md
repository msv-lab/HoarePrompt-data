Output State: **The program returns a string formed by joining all elements in the list `result` with newline characters. Each element in `result` represents an action (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If the loop did not execute due to `n` being 0 or an obstacle being within `s` distance of the current position, the function would have returned 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If `current_position` is less than `m`, the last element in `result` is `'RUN {m - current_position}'`. The exact content of `result` depends on the sequence of actions taken during the navigation process.**
