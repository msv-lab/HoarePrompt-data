You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, s, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ s, d ≤ 10^9. obstacles is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1, and all a_i are unique.
def func_1(n, m, s, d, obstacles):
    obstacles.sort()
    if (obstacles[0] < s) :
        return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
        #The program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n, m, s, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ s, d ≤ 10^9. `obstacles` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1, and all a_i are unique. The first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to s.
    result = []

current_position = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if obstacles[i] - current_position < s:
            return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
        
        run_length = obstacles[i] - s - current_position
        
        if run_length > 0:
            result.append(f'RUN {run_length}')
            current_position += run_length
        
        jump_end = obstacles[i]
        
        while i + 1 < n and obstacles[i + 1] <= jump_end + d:
            jump_end = obstacles[i + 1]
            i += 1
        
        jump_length = jump_end - current_position
        
        if jump_length > d:
            return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
        
        result.append(f'JUMP {jump_length}')
        
        current_position += jump_length
        
        if current_position >= m:
            return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, obstacles is a sorted list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all a_i are unique, the first element of obstacles is greater than or equal to s, result is a list of strings representing the sequence of actions (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles, current_position is the sum of all run and jump lengths, the loop has executed n times, and current_position is less than m unless the loop encountered a condition causing it to return 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The loop does not execute if n is 0 or if any obstacle is within s distance of the current position, causing an immediate return of 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
    if (current_position < m) :
        result.append(f'RUN {m - current_position}')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `obstacles` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m - 1 and all `a_i` are unique, the first element of `obstacles` is greater than or equal to `s`, `result` is a list of strings representing the sequence of actions (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If `current_position` is less than `m`, `result` includes an additional string `'RUN {m - current_position}'`, and the loop does not execute if `n` is 0 or if any obstacle is within `s` distance of the current position, causing an immediate return of 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If `current_position` is not less than `m`, the loop does not execute further and the function continues as per the logic outside the if-else block.
    return '\n'.join(result)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining all elements in the list `result` with newline characters. Each element in `result` represents an action (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If the loop did not execute due to `n` being 0 or an obstacle being within `s` distance of the current position, the function would have returned 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If `current_position` is less than `m`, the last element in `result` is `'RUN {m - current_position}'`. The exact content of `result` depends on the sequence of actions taken during the navigation process.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters `n`, `m`, `s`, `d`, and `obstacles`. It returns 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the task cannot be completed due to various constraints. Otherwise, it returns a string representing a sequence of actions (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles, with the final action ensuring the total distance `m` is covered.

Case_11: The program returns a string formed by joining all elements in the list `result` with newline characters. Each element in `result` represents an action (RUN or JUMP) taken to navigate through the obstacles. If the loop did not execute due to `n` being 0 or an obstacle being within `s` distance of the current position, the function would have returned 'IMPOSSIBLE'. If `current_position` is less than `m`, the last element in `result` is `'RUN {m - current_position}'`. The exact content of `result` depends on the sequence of actions taken during the navigation process.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
