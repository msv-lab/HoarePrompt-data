The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `L`, and the range defined by `range(1, L + 1)`. Therefore, we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `L + 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, if the current `i` is `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `L + 1`.

Thus, if the current state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\)
- `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\)
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\)
- `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `min(costs[j] for j in range(min(n, i+1)))`

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue as long as `i < L + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `min(costs[j] for j in range(min(n, i+1)))`, `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), and `L` must be such that \(k + 1 < L + 1\) or equivalently \(k < L\)**
