The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq L\) is the minimum cost to reach `i` using volumes \(2^j - 1\) for \(0 \leq j < n\). If `vol` is less than or equal to `i` (which is `L + 1`), `dp[L + 1]` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `dp[L] + costs[1]`, and `vol` remains 1.**
