The given Python code snippet updates the `dp` list at index `i` with the minimum of its current value and the value of `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`.

- `i` is 1.
- `vol` is 0.
- `dp[0]` is 0.
- `dp[i]` (which is `dp[1]`) is initially infinity.
- `costs[j]` (which is `costs[0]`) is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\).

Given these conditions:
- `dp[1]` will be updated to the minimum of its current value (infinity) and `dp[1 - 0] + costs[0]`, which simplifies to `dp[1]` being set to `dp[1]` or `dp[0] + costs[0]`.
- Since `dp[0]` is 0, this means `dp[1]` will be set to `costs[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, and all other elements are infinity, `i` is 1, `L` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0, and `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.**
