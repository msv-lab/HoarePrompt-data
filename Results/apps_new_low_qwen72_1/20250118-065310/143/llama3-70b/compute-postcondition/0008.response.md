The code snippet `vol = 2 ** j - 1` updates the value of `vol` based on the current value of `j`. Given that `j` is 1, `vol` will be calculated as follows:

- `vol = 2 ** 1 - 1`
- `vol = 2 - 1`
- `vol = 1`

Therefore, the updated value of `vol` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, and all other elements are infinity, `i` is 1, `L` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
