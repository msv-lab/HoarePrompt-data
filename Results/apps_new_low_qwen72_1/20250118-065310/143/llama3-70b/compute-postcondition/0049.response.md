Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `L` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `costs`. It then calculates the minimum cost to reach a target volume `L` using volumes of the form \(2^j - 1\) (where \(0 \leq j < n\)), with each volume having an associated cost from the `costs` list. The function prints the minimum cost to reach the target volume `L`. If it is not possible to reach the target volume `L` with the given volumes, the function prints `-1`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain unchanged, and the dynamic programming array `dp` contains the minimum costs to reach each volume from 0 to `L`. ** 

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `L` is 0, the function will print 0 because no cost is needed to reach a volume of 0.
- If the target volume `L` cannot be reached with any combination of the given volumes, the function will print `-1`.
- If `n` is 1, the function will only consider a single volume and its associated cost.
- If all elements in `costs` are very high, the function may still print a high cost or `-1` if the target volume cannot be reached.
