Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and for \(1 \leq i \leq L\), `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to reach `i` using volumes \(2^j - 1\) for \(0 \leq j < n\). Variables `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain constant throughout the loop. The loop updates `dp[i]` for each valid volume \(2^j - 1\) where \(0 \leq j < n\) and `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.**
