The value of `vol` is calculated as \(2^j - 1\). Given that `j` is 0, \(2^0 - 1\) equals \(1 - 1\), which results in `vol` being 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are infinity, `i` is 1, `L` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0.
