Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `min(costs[j] for j in range(min(n, i+1)))`, `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), `L` must be such that \(k + 1 < L + 1\) or equivalently \(k < L\), `j` is 0, `vol` is 0, and the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.***
