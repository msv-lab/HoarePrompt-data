The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `c`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. However, based on the parameters, it is likely that the function performs some computation involving the integer `n`, the integer `L`, and the list of integers `c`.

Since the output is not specified, I cannot provide a definitive description of the return value. If you can provide more details about the expected output, I can refine the functionality description accordingly.

For now, the best I can provide is:
Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `L` (an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and `c` (a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The function's return value is not specified.**
