The value of `vol` is updated to \(2^j - 1\). Given that `j` is 2, \(2^2 - 1\) equals 3. Therefore, `vol` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `min(costs[0], costs[1])` if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, and all other elements are infinity, `i` is 1, `L` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3**
