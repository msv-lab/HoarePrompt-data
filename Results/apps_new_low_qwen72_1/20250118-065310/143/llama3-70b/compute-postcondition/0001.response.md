To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will start its first iteration.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
- `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are infinity.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, L + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `L`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `L`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute the First Time:
- `i` must be 1.
- `L` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `L`, `L` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute).

### State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
- `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are infinity.
- `i` is 1.
- `L` must be at least 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are infinity, `i` is 1, `L` must be at least 1**
