Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` remain unchanged. If `vol` (which is 3) is less than or equal to `i`, `dp[i]` for \(3 \leq i \leq L\) is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 3] + costs[2])`.***
