To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
- `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq L\) is the minimum cost to reach `i` using volumes \(2^j - 1\) for \(0 \leq j < n\).
- `i` is `L + 1`.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `vol` is \(2^{n-1} - 1\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the parameter `n`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(n)` contains at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 0.
3. **Initial Values**:
   - `j` starts from 0 (the first value in `range(n)`).
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be 0. The other variables (`L`, `costs`, `dp`, `i`, and `vol`) do not directly affect the condition for the loop to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq L\) is the minimum cost to reach `i` using volumes \(2^j - 1\) for \(0 \leq j < n\), `i` is `L + 1`, `vol` is \(2^{n-1} - 1\)**
