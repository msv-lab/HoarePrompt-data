The provided code initializes several variables and constructs a dynamic programming array (`dp`). Here's the detailed analysis and final output state:

1. The first line reads two integers from the input, `n` and `L`, and assigns them to the corresponding variables. These values are within the specified ranges: 1 ≤ n ≤ 30 and 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9.
2. The second line reads a list of `n` integers from the input, which are then stored in the list `costs`. Each element `c_i` in `costs` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
3. The third line initializes a list `dp` of length `L + 1` with each element set to infinity (`float('inf')`).
4. The fourth line sets the first element of the `dp` list to 0.

Combining these effects, the final state is as follows:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9.
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
- `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where the first element is 0 and all other elements are infinity.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, costs is a list of n integers where each c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, dp is a list of length L + 1 where dp[0] is 0 and all other elements are infinity**.
