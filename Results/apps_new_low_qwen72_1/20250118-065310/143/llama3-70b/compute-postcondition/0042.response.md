The value of `vol` is updated to \(2^j - 1\). Given that `j` is 2, `vol` becomes \(2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq L\) is the minimum cost to reach `i` using volumes \(2^j - 1\) for \(0 \leq j < n\), `vol` is 3.**
