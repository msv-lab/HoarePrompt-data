The value of `vol` is recalculated as \(2^j - 1\). Given that `j` is 0, the new value of `vol` is \(2^0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\).

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq L\) is the minimum cost to reach `i` using volumes \(2^j - 1\) for \(0 \leq j < n\), `i` is `L + 1`, `vol` is 0.
