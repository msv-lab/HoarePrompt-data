You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `L` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `costs`. It then calculates the minimum cost to reach a target volume `L` using volumes of the form \(2^j - 1\) (where \(0 \leq j < n\)), with each volume having an associated cost from the `costs` list. The function prints the minimum cost to reach the target volume `L`. If it is not possible to reach the target volume `L` with the given volumes, the function prints `-1`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain unchanged, and the dynamic programming array `dp` contains the minimum costs to reach each volume from 0 to `L`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to purchase at least \( L \) liters of lemonade.
   - Bottles are available in \( n \) different volumes, where the volume of the \( i \)-th bottle is \( 2^i - 1 \) liters.
   - Each bottle has a cost \( c_i \).
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring we buy at least \( L \) liters.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.
   - `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy exactly \( i \) liters of lemonade.
   - The initial state `dp[0]` is set to 0 because it costs nothing to buy 0 liters.
   - For each volume \( i \) from 1 to \( L \), the program iterates over all bottle types \( j \) and updates `dp[i]` if adding a bottle of type \( j \) (with volume \( 2^j - 1 \)) to a previous state \( dp[i - vol] \) results in a lower cost.

3. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The volume of the \( j \)-th bottle is calculated as \( 2^j - 1 \).
   - This ensures that the volume increases exponentially, which is consistent with the problem statement.

4. **Cost Update**:
   - The program checks if the current volume \( vol \) is less than or equal to \( i \).
   - If so, it updates `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and the cost of buying a bottle of type \( j \) plus the cost of the remaining volume \( dp[i - vol] \).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints `dp[L]` if it is not infinity, indicating that a solution was found.
   - If no solution is found (i.e., `dp[L]` remains infinity), it prints -1, which is not necessary according to the problem statement but ensures robustness.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost to buy at least \( L \) liters of lemonade.
- It handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
- The logic and implementation are sound and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
