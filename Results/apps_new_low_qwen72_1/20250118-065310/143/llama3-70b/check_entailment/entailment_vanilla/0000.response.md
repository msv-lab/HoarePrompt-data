### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to purchase at least \( L \) liters of lemonade.
   - Bottles are available in \( n \) different volumes, where the volume of the \( i \)-th bottle is \( 2^i - 1 \) liters.
   - Each bottle has a cost \( c_i \).
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring we buy at least \( L \) liters.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.
   - `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy exactly \( i \) liters of lemonade.
   - The initial state `dp[0]` is set to 0 because it costs nothing to buy 0 liters.
   - For each volume \( i \) from 1 to \( L \), the program iterates over all bottle types \( j \) and updates `dp[i]` if adding a bottle of type \( j \) (with volume \( 2^j - 1 \)) to a previous state \( dp[i - vol] \) results in a lower cost.

3. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The volume of the \( j \)-th bottle is calculated as \( 2^j - 1 \).
   - This ensures that the volume increases exponentially, which is consistent with the problem statement.

4. **Cost Update**:
   - The program checks if the current volume \( vol \) is less than or equal to \( i \).
   - If so, it updates `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and the cost of buying a bottle of type \( j \) plus the cost of the remaining volume \( dp[i - vol] \).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints `dp[L]` if it is not infinity, indicating that a solution was found.
   - If no solution is found (i.e., `dp[L]` remains infinity), it prints -1, which is not necessary according to the problem statement but ensures robustness.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost to buy at least \( L \) liters of lemonade.
- It handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
- The logic and implementation are sound and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
