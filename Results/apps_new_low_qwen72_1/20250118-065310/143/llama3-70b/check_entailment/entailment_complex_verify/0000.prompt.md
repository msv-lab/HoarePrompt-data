You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and c is a list of n integers where each c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())

costs = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)

dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\), `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\), `dp` is a list of length \(L + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and for \(1 \leq i \leq L\), `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to reach `i` using volumes \(2^j - 1\) for \(0 \leq j < n\). Variables `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain constant throughout the loop. The loop updates `dp[i]` for each valid volume \(2^j - 1\) where \(0 \leq j < n\) and `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `L` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `costs`. It then calculates the minimum cost to reach a target volume `L` using volumes of the form \(2^j - 1\) (where \(0 \leq j < n\)), with each volume having an associated cost from the `costs` list. The function prints the minimum cost to reach the target volume `L`. If it is not possible to reach the target volume `L` with the given volumes, the function prints `-1`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain unchanged, and the dynamic programming array `dp` contains the minimum costs to reach each volume from 0 to `L`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade using bottles of various volumes and costs. The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with infinity for all indices except `dp[0]`, which is set to 0 because no cost is needed to buy 0 liters of lemonade. For each volume from 1 to `L`, the program iterates over all bottle types and updates the `dp` array to reflect the minimum cost to achieve that volume. The final answer is found in `dp[L]`, and if it remains infinity, it indicates that it's impossible to buy exactly `L` liters (though the problem guarantees that it is always possible to buy at least `L` liters). The program correctly handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.
