Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade using bottles of various volumes and costs. The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with infinity for all indices except `dp[0]`, which is set to 0 because no cost is needed to buy 0 liters of lemonade. For each volume from 1 to `L`, the program iterates over all bottle types and updates the `dp` array to reflect the minimum cost to achieve that volume. The final answer is found in `dp[L]`, and if it remains infinity, it indicates that it's impossible to buy exactly `L` liters (though the problem guarantees that it is always possible to buy at least `L` liters). The program correctly handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.
