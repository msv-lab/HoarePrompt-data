This function reads two sets of three non-negative integers each (a, b, c and x, y, z) from user input, where each integer is within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000. It calculates the deficits (if x > a, y > b, or z > c) and the surplus (if a > x, b > y, or c > z) of each pair. The surplus values are halved and summed up to determine if the total surplus can cover the total deficit. If the total surplus is greater than or equal to the total deficit, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After execution, the variables a, b, c, x, y, z, deficit_blue, deficit_violet, deficit_orange, extra_blue, extra_violet, extra_orange, extra_spheres, and total_deficit retain their values.
