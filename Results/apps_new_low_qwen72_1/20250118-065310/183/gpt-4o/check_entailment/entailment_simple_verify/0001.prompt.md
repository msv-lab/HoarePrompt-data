You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

- Program: 
def func():
    (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)
    deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)
    deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)
    extra_blue = max(0, a - x)
    extra_violet = max(0, b - y)
    extra_orange = max(0, c - z)
    extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2
    total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if extra_spheres >= total_deficit:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c, x, y, z ≤ 1,000,000.
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

x, y, z = map(int, input().split())

deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)

deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)

deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)

extra_blue = max(0, a - x)

extra_violet = max(0, b - y)

extra_orange = max(0, c - z)

extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2

total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if (extra_spheres >= total_deficit) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *a, b, c, x, y, z, deficit_blue, deficit_violet, deficit_orange, extra_blue, extra_violet, extra_orange, extra_spheres, and total_deficit retain their original values. If extra_spheres is greater than or equal to total_deficit, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the deficit of each type of sphere (blue, violet, orange) that Carl needs to achieve his goal and the number of extra spheres he can use to transform into the needed colors. The key logic is to check if the number of extra spheres (after dividing by 2, since two spheres of the same color can be transformed into one of another color) is enough to cover the total deficit.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program assumes that any extra spheres can be used to directly cover the deficit, but this is not always correct. For example, if Carl has an excess of blue spheres but needs more violet and orange spheres, he cannot simply use all the extra blue spheres to create the needed violet and orange spheres because the transformation requires two spheres of the same color.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:
1. Calculate the initial deficit for each color.
2. Check if the total number of extra spheres (after transformations) is sufficient to cover the deficits.
3. Ensure that the transformations can actually produce the required spheres. This involves checking if the extra spheres can be paired to produce the necessary spheres.

Given the current implementation, it does not correctly handle the pairing of extra spheres to produce the required spheres. Therefore, the program may produce incorrect results in some cases.
