You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

- Program: 
def func():
    (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)
    deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)
    deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)
    extra_blue = max(0, a - x)
    extra_violet = max(0, b - y)
    extra_orange = max(0, c - z)
    extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2
    total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if extra_spheres >= total_deficit:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c, x, y, z ≤ 1,000,000.
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

x, y, z = map(int, input().split())

deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)

deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)

deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)

extra_blue = max(0, a - x)

extra_violet = max(0, b - y)

extra_orange = max(0, c - z)

extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2

total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if (extra_spheres >= total_deficit) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *a, b, c, x, y, z, deficit_blue, deficit_violet, deficit_orange, extra_blue, extra_violet, extra_orange, extra_spheres, and total_deficit retain their original values. If extra_spheres is greater than or equal to total_deficit, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle a specific edge case where the initial number of spheres of a certain color is less than the required number, but there are enough extra spheres of other colors to compensate through the transformation process. The program incorrectly calculates the `extra_spheres` by only considering the integer division of the surplus spheres, which can lead to underestimating the total number of transformations possible.

**Counterexample:**
- Input:
  ```
  1 1 8
  3 3 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  Yes
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  No
  ```

In this case, the magician starts with 1 blue, 1 violet, and 8 orange spheres, and needs 3 blue, 3 violet, and 3 orange spheres. The program incorrectly determines that it's not possible because it doesn't account for the fact that the 8 orange spheres can be transformed into 4 spheres of any other color, which would be sufficient to meet the requirements.
