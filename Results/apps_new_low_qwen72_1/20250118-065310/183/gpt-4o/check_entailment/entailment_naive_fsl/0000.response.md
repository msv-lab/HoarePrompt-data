Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle a specific edge case where the initial number of spheres of a certain color is less than the required number, but there are enough extra spheres of other colors to compensate through the transformation process. The program incorrectly calculates the `extra_spheres` by only considering the integer division of the surplus spheres, which can lead to underestimating the total number of transformations possible.

**Counterexample:**
- Input:
  ```
  1 1 8
  3 3 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  Yes
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  No
  ```

In this case, the magician starts with 1 blue, 1 violet, and 8 orange spheres, and needs 3 blue, 3 violet, and 3 orange spheres. The program incorrectly determines that it's not possible because it doesn't account for the fact that the 8 orange spheres can be transformed into 4 spheres of any other color, which would be sufficient to meet the requirements.
