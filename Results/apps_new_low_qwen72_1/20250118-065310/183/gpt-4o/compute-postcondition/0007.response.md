Functionality: ** This function reads two sets of three non-negative integers each (a, b, c and x, y, z) from user input, where each integer is within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000. It calculates the deficits (if x > a, y > b, or z > c) and the surplus (if a > x, b > y, or c > z) of each pair. The surplus values are halved and summed up to determine if the total surplus can cover the total deficit. If the total surplus is greater than or equal to the total deficit, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After execution, the variables a, b, c, x, y, z, deficit_blue, deficit_violet, deficit_orange, extra_blue, extra_violet, extra_orange, extra_spheres, and total_deficit retain their values. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- If any of the input values are negative or exceed 1,000,000, the behavior is undefined as the function assumes valid input within the specified range.
- If the surplus is exactly half of a value (e.g., extra_blue = 1), the integer division will result in 0, potentially affecting the final comparison.
- The function does not handle cases where the input is not a valid set of integers, which could lead to runtime errors.
