Postcondition: **a is a, b is b, c is c, x is x, y is y, z is z, deficit_blue is max(0, x - a), deficit_violet is max(0, y - b), deficit_orange is max(0, z - c), extra_blue is max(0, a - x), extra_violet is max(0, b - y), extra_orange is max(0, c - z), extra_spheres is (max(0, a - x) // 2) + (max(0, b - y) // 2) + (max(0, c - z) // 2), total_deficit is max(0, x - a) + max(0, y - b) + max(0, z - c), and extra_spheres is less than total_deficit**
