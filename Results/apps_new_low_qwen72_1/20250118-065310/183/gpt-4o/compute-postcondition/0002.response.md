The code snippet provided is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. This operation does not alter the state of any variables in the environment. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only addition being that the string 'Yes' is printed.

Output State: **a is a, b is b, c is c, x is x, y is y, z is z, deficit_blue is max(0, x - a), deficit_violet is max(0, y - b), deficit_orange is max(0, z - c), extra_blue is max(0, a - x), extra_violet is max(0, b - y), extra_orange is max(0, c - z), extra_spheres is (max(0, a - x) // 2) + (max(0, b - y) // 2) + (max(0, c - z) // 2), total_deficit is max(0, x - a) + max(0, y - b) + max(0, z - c), and the current value of extra_spheres is greater than or equal to the current value of total_deficit, 'Yes' is printed**
