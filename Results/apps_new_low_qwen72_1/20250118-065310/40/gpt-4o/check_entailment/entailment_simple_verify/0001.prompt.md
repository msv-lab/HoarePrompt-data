You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The program aims to find the length of the longest substring of the input string `s` that is not a palindrome. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Initial Check for Single Character Strings**: If the string `s` has a length of 1 or less, it is a palindrome by definition, and thus the function prints `0`.

2. **Check if the Entire String is Not a Palindrome**: If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (checked using `func_1(s)`), then the entire string is the longest non-palindromic substring, and the function prints the length of `s`.

3. **Check Substrings by Removing One Character**:
   - If the substring `s[1:]` (the string without the first character) is not a palindrome, it is the longest non-palindromic substring, and the function prints the length of `s` minus 1.
   - If the substring `s[:-1]` (the string without the last character) is not a palindrome, it is the longest non-palindromic substring, and the function prints the length of `s` minus 1.

4. **No Non-Palindromic Substring Found**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints `0`, indicating that all substrings of `s` are palindromes.

The function `func_1(s)` checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

This logic correctly implements the problem's requirements:
- It correctly identifies single-character strings and prints `0`.
- It correctly identifies the entire string as the longest non-palindromic substring if it is not a palindrome.
- It correctly checks the two possible longest non-palindromic substrings by removing one character from either end.
- It correctly prints `0` if all substrings are palindromes.

Thus, the program is logically correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
