Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the length of the longest substring of the input string `s` that is not a palindrome. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. It first checks if the length of the string `s` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints `0` because a single character or an empty string cannot contain a non-palindromic substring.
2. It then checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s`.
3. If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it checks if the substring `s[1:]` (excluding the first character) is not a palindrome. If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints the length of this substring.
4. Next, it checks if the substring `s[:-1]` (excluding the last character) is not a palindrome. If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints the length of this substring.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that all possible substrings of `s` are palindromes, so it prints `0`.

The `func_1` function correctly identifies whether a given string is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse. This function is used to check the palindromicity of the full string and the two substrings mentioned.

Given the problem requirements and the execution summary, the program appears to handle all edge cases and typical cases correctly. It ensures that the longest non-palindromic substring's length is found or returns `0` if no such substring exists.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
