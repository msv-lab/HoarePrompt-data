You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a non-empty string of at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only. The function returns `True` if the string `s` is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards), and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints, including strings of length 1, which are trivially palindromes, and strings of length up to 50 characters. The function does not modify the input string `s` and does not have any side effects.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle cases where the longest non-palindromic substring is not one of the two immediate substrings (removing the first or last character). For example, consider the string `s = "abbaa"`. The longest non-palindromic substring here is `"bbaa"` (length 4), but the program will incorrectly output `0` because it checks only `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]`, which are both palindromes. Therefore, the program does not correctly find the longest non-palindromic substring in all cases.
