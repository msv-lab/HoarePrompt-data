Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed fails to handle cases where the longest non-palindromic substring is not one of the two immediate substrings (removing the first or last character). Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the length of the string `s` is less than or equal to 1. If true, it prints `0` because a single character or an empty string cannot form a non-palindromic substring.

2. **Full String Check**: If the string `s` itself is not a palindrome (checked using `func_1(s)`), it prints the length of `s` because the entire string is the longest non-palindromic substring.

3. **Substrings Check**: If the full string is a palindrome, the program then checks two specific substrings: `s[1:]` (the string without the first character) and `s[:-1]` (the string without the last character). If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, it prints the length of that substring, which is `len(s) - 1`.

4. **Default Case**: If both `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]` are palindromes, the program prints `0`, indicating that no non-palindromic substring exists.

However, this approach is flawed because it only considers two specific substrings (`s[1:]` and `s[:-1]`). It does not account for other possible substrings that might be longer and non-palindromic. For example, in the case of `s = "abbaa"`, the longest non-palindromic substring is `"bbaa"` (length 4), but the program will incorrectly output `0` because both `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]` are palindromes.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach would be needed, such as checking all possible substrings of the input string to find the longest non-palindromic one.

Final: **False**
