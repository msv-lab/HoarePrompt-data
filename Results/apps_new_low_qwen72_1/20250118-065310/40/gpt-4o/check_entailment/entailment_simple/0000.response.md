Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in the given string `s`. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. If the length of `s` is 1 or less, it prints 0 because a single character is always a palindrome, and there are no non-palindromic substrings.
2. It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` because the entire string is the longest non-palindromic substring.
3. If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it checks if the substring `s[1:]` (the string without the first character) is not a palindrome. If `s[1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` minus 1.
4. If both `s` and `s[1:]` are palindromes, it checks if the substring `s[:-1]` (the string without the last character) is not a palindrome. If `s[:-1]` is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` minus 1.
5. If all checks fail, meaning all substrings of `s` are palindromes, it prints 0.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse.

The logic of the program ensures that it correctly handles all cases specified in the problem statement:
- For a single character or an empty string, it prints 0.
- For a non-palindromic string, it prints the length of the string.
- For a palindromic string, it checks the longest possible non-palindromic substrings by removing one character at a time from either end.
- If all substrings are palindromes, it prints 0.

Thus, the program is logically correct and should work as intended.
