Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading a string `s` using `input().strip()`, ensuring any leading or trailing spaces are removed. This aligns with the problem's requirement that `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.

2. **Base Case Check**: The program checks if the length of `s` is less than or equal to 1. If true, it prints `0` because a string of length 1 is always a palindrome, and thus has no non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Full String Check**: If `s` is longer than 1 character, the program uses `func_1` to check if `s` itself is a palindrome. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` because the entire string is the longest non-palindromic substring.

4. **Substrings Check**: If `s` is a palindrome, the program checks two potential non-palindromic substrings:
   - `s[1:]`: The substring excluding the first character.
   - `s[:-1]`: The substring excluding the last character.
   If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` minus 1, as both substrings are of length `len(s) - 1`.

5. **No Non-Palindromic Substring**: If neither `s[1:]` nor `s[:-1]` is a non-palindrome, the program prints `0` because all substrings of `s` are palindromes.

6. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse. It works for all valid inputs as specified in the problem statement.

**Conclusion**:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic required by the problem statement. It correctly identifies the longest non-palindromic substring or determines that no such substring exists.

Correctness: **True**
