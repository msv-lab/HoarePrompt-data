Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle cases where the longest non-palindromic substring is not one of the two immediate substrings (removing the first or last character). For example, consider the string `s = "abbaa"`. The longest non-palindromic substring here is `"bbaa"` (length 4), but the program will incorrectly output `0` because it checks only `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]`, which are both palindromes. Therefore, the program does not correctly find the longest non-palindromic substring in all cases.
