Reasoning:

The program aims to find the length of the longest substring of the input string `s` that is not a palindrome. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Initial Check for Single Character Strings**: If the string `s` has a length of 1 or less, it is a palindrome by definition, and thus the function prints `0`.

2. **Check if the Entire String is Not a Palindrome**: If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (checked using `func_1(s)`), then the entire string is the longest non-palindromic substring, and the function prints the length of `s`.

3. **Check Substrings by Removing One Character**:
   - If the substring `s[1:]` (the string without the first character) is not a palindrome, it is the longest non-palindromic substring, and the function prints the length of `s` minus 1.
   - If the substring `s[:-1]` (the string without the last character) is not a palindrome, it is the longest non-palindromic substring, and the function prints the length of `s` minus 1.

4. **No Non-Palindromic Substring Found**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints `0`, indicating that all substrings of `s` are palindromes.

The function `func_1(s)` checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

This logic correctly implements the problem's requirements:
- It correctly identifies single-character strings and prints `0`.
- It correctly identifies the entire string as the longest non-palindromic substring if it is not a palindrome.
- It correctly checks the two possible longest non-palindromic substrings by removing one character from either end.
- It correctly prints `0` if all substrings are palindromes.

Thus, the program is logically correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
