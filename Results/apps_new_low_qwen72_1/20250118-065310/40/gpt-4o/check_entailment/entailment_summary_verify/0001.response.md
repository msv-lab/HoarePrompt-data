Reasoning:

The program's logic and structure align well with the problem's requirements, but there are some subtle issues that need to be addressed to ensure correctness:

1. **Initial Check for Single Character Strings**: The check `if len(s) <= 1:` correctly identifies that single-character strings are palindromes and prints `0`. This is correct.

2. **Check if the Entire String is Not a Palindrome**: The condition `if not func_1(s):` correctly checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If it is not a palindrome, the entire string is the longest non-palindromic substring, and the function prints the length of `s`. This is correct.

3. **Check Substrings by Removing One Character**:
   - The conditions `if not func_1(s[1:]):` and `if not func_1(s[:-1]):` are used to check if the substring without the first character or the last character is not a palindrome. However, these conditions are not sufficient to guarantee that the longest non-palindromic substring is found. The program only checks these two specific substrings, which might miss other longer non-palindromic substrings.

4. **No Non-Palindromic Substring Found**: The final `else` block prints `0` if none of the above conditions are met. This is correct for the case where all substrings are palindromes.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input "mew", the entire string is not a palindrome, so the program correctly prints `3`.
- For the input "wuffuw", the program checks `s[1:]` ("uffuw") and finds it is not a palindrome, so it correctly prints `5`.
- For the input "qqqqqqqq", the program correctly prints `0` because all substrings are palindromes.

However, consider the input "abba":
- The entire string "abba" is a palindrome, so the program checks `s[1:]` ("bba") and `s[:-1]` ("abb").
- Both "bba" and "abb" are not palindromes, but the longest non-palindromic substring here is actually "abb" or "bba", both of length 3. The program will print `3` for both cases, which is correct, but it only checks these two specific substrings.

### Missing Consideration:
The program does not account for other potential non-palindromic substrings that might be longer than the ones checked. For example, if the input is "abcba", the program will incorrectly print `4` (for "bcba" or "abc"), but the longest non-palindromic substring is actually "abc" or "cba", both of length 3.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct because it only checks specific substrings and may miss the longest non-palindromic substring in some cases.

Final: **False**
