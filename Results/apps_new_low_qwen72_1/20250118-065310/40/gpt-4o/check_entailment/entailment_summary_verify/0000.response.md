Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. The program checks only two specific substrings: the substring obtained by removing the first character (`s[1:]`) and the substring obtained by removing the last character (`s[:-1]`). However, the longest non-palindromic substring might be found by removing other characters or combinations of characters. 

For example, consider the string `s = "abbaa"`. The program will:
1. Check if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`. Since `s` is not a palindrome, it will print `len(s)`, which is 5.
2. If the entire string were a palindrome, it would then check `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]`. In this case, both `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]` are palindromes, leading to the program printing `0`.

However, the correct output should be `4` because the longest non-palindromic substring is `"bbaa"`. The program fails to identify this because it only checks two specific substrings, not all possible substrings.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate through all possible substrings of `s` and find the longest one that is not a palindrome. This requires a more comprehensive approach than the current implementation.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
