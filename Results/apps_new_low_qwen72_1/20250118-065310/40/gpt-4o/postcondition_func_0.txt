The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a non-empty string of at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only. The function returns `True` if the string `s` is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards), and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints, including strings of length 1, which are trivially palindromes, and strings of length up to 50 characters. The function does not modify the input string `s` and does not have any side effects.
