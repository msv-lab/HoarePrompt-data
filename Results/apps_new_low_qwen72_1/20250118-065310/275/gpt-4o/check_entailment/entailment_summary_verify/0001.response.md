### Reasoning:

1. **Level Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the depth of nested brackets by iterating through the input sequence and maintaining a `current_level` variable.
   - It also keeps track of the maximum level of nesting encountered, which is stored in `max_level`.

2. **Drawing Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a 2D list `drawing` with dimensions `(2 * max_level + 1) x (2 * n)`. This ensures that there is enough space to draw the brackets in the required format.
   - The dimensions are calculated correctly to accommodate the maximum height and width of the drawing.

3. **Bracket Drawing**:
   - When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the program places the appropriate `+`, `-`, and `|` characters to represent the start of a new bracket.
   - When encountering a closing bracket `]`, the program places the appropriate `+`, `-`, and `|` characters to represent the end of a bracket.
   - The program correctly adjusts the `current_level` and `pos` variables to keep track of the current position in the drawing.
   - The placement of characters is consistent with the problem's requirements, ensuring that the drawing is minimal and adheres to the constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as nested brackets and consecutive brackets correctly by ensuring that the drawing is minimal and adheres to the problem's constraints.
   - The program correctly manages the `pos` variable to handle consecutive closing brackets, ensuring that the drawing does not have unnecessary spaces.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the drawing row by row, ensuring that the output is formatted correctly without unnecessary spaces.
   - The final state of the program after the function concludes is as described in the function summary, with `n` remaining an even integer within the specified range, `sequence` remaining unchanged, `levels` being an empty list, `max_level` being the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` containing the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure, `current_level` being 0, and `pos` being `2 * n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed reasoning and verification against the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
