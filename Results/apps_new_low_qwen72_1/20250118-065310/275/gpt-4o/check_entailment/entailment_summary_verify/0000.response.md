Reasoning: The original assessment identifies a critical issue with the program's handling of spaces between consecutive brackets. The function `func_1` indeed does not account for the required spaces, which is essential for the correct visual separation of brackets as per the problem description. The program constructs the `drawing` array and fills it with '+', '-', and '|' characters but does not include any mechanism to insert spaces between consecutive brackets. This omission results in the brackets merging visually, which contradicts the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
8
[[][]][]
```
The expected output should be:
```
+-        -++- -+    
|+- -++- -+||   |    
||   ||   |||   |    
|+- -++- -+||   |    
+-        -++- -+    
```
However, the program will produce an output without the necessary spaces between the brackets, leading to an incorrect visual representation.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the program's handling of spaces between consecutive brackets.

Final: **False**
