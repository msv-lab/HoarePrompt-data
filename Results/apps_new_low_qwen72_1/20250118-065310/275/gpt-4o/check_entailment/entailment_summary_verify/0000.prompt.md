You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A sequence of square brackets is regular if by inserting symbols "+" and "1" into it, you can get a regular mathematical expression from it. For example, sequences "[[]][]", "[]" and "[[][[]]]" — are regular, at the same time "][", "[[]" and "[[]]][" — are irregular. 

Draw the given sequence using a minimalistic pseudographics in the strip of the lowest possible height — use symbols '+', '-' and '|'. For example, the sequence "[[][]][]" should be represented as: 

+-        -++- -+    

|+- -++- -+||   |

||   ||   |||   |

|+- -++- -+||   |

+-        -++- -+



Each bracket should be represented with the hepl of one or more symbols '|' (the vertical part) and symbols '+' and '-' as on the example which is given above.

Brackets should be drawn without spaces one by one, only dividing pairs of consecutive pairwise brackets with a single-space bar (so that the two brackets do not visually merge into one symbol). The image should have the minimum possible height. 

The enclosed bracket is always smaller than the surrounding bracket, but each bracket separately strives to maximize the height of the image. So the pair of final brackets in the example above occupies the entire height of the image.

Study carefully the examples below, they adequately explain the condition of the problem. Pay attention that in this problem the answer (the image) is unique. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the sequence of brackets.

The second line contains the sequence of brackets — these are n symbols "[" and "]". It is guaranteed that the given sequence of brackets is regular. 


-----Output-----

Print the drawn bracket sequence in the format which is given in the condition. Don't print extra (unnecessary) spaces.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `sequence` of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters. The function processes the `sequence` to create an ASCII representation of the bracket structure. It constructs a list `drawing` with `2 * max_level + 1` rows and `2 * n` columns, where `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`. Each row in `drawing` is a list of spaces, and the function fills in the appropriate positions with '+', '-', and '|' characters to represent the corners, horizontal lines, and vertical lines of the bracket structure, respectively. After constructing the `drawing`, the function prints each row of the `drawing` to the console. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` remains an even integer within the specified range, `sequence` remains unchanged, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure, `current_level` is 0, and `pos` is `2 * n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the spacing between brackets correctly. According to the problem description, consecutive brackets should be separated by a single space to ensure they do not visually merge into one symbol. However, the program does not insert these spaces, which leads to incorrect output for sequences with multiple consecutive brackets.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
[[][]][]
```
The expected output should be:
```
+-        -++- -+    
|+- -++- -+||   |    
||   ||   |||   |    
|+- -++- -+||   |    
+-        -++- -+    
```
However, the program will produce an output without the necessary spaces between the brackets, leading to an incorrect visual representation. This violates the requirement that the brackets should be separated by a single space when they are consecutive.
