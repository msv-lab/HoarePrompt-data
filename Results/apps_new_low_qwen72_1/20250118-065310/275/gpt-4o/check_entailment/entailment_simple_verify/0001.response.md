Reasoning:

1. **Level Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the depth of nested brackets by iterating through the input sequence and maintaining a `current_level` variable. It also keeps track of the maximum level of nesting encountered, which will be used to determine the height of the drawing. This part of the program works as intended.

2. **Drawing Initialization**: The program initializes a 2D list `drawing` with dimensions `(2 * max_level + 1) x (2 * n)`. This ensures that there is enough space to draw the brackets in the required format. The initialization is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

3. **Bracket Drawing**:
   - When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the program places the appropriate `+`, `-`, and `|` characters to represent the start of a new bracket. The placement of these characters is correct and follows the rules specified in the problem description.
   - When encountering a closing bracket `]`, the program places the appropriate `+`, `-`, and `|` characters to represent the end of a bracket. The placement of these characters is also correct.
   - The program correctly adjusts the `current_level` and `pos` variables to keep track of the current position in the drawing. However, there is a potential issue in the loop where the program tries to skip consecutive closing brackets. Specifically, the line `while pos < 2 * n and sequence[pos] == ']': pos += 1` might cause `pos` to exceed the bounds of the sequence, leading to an index out of range error. This is a critical bug that needs to be addressed.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program generally handles edge cases such as nested brackets and consecutive brackets correctly, but the aforementioned bug in handling consecutive closing brackets could lead to incorrect output or runtime errors.

5. **Output**: The program prints the drawing row by row, ensuring that the output is formatted correctly without unnecessary spaces. However, due to the potential bug mentioned, the output might not be correct in all cases.

Given the potential bug in handling consecutive closing brackets, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
