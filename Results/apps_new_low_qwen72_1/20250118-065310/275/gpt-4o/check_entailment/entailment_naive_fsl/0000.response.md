Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the spacing between brackets correctly. According to the problem description, consecutive brackets should be separated by a single space to ensure they do not visually merge into one symbol. However, the program does not insert these spaces, which leads to incorrect output for sequences with multiple consecutive brackets.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
[[][]][]
```
The expected output should be:
```
+-        -++- -+    
|+- -++- -+||   |    
||   ||   |||   |    
|+- -++- -+||   |    
+-        -++- -+    
```
However, the program will produce an output without the necessary spaces between the brackets, leading to an incorrect visual representation. This violates the requirement that the brackets should be separated by a single space when they are consecutive.
