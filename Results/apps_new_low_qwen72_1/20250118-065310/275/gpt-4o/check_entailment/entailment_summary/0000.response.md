Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly interpret the problem requirements and generates the correct output for the given test cases. Here are the key points:

1. **Bracket Depth Calculation**: The program uses a list `levels` to keep track of the depth of the brackets as it iterates through the `sequence`. This allows it to determine the maximum depth (`max_level`) of the bracket structure, which is crucial for determining the height of the drawing.

2. **Drawing Initialization**: The `drawing` list is initialized with the correct dimensions: `2 * max_level + 1` rows and `2 * n` columns. This ensures that there is enough space to draw the brackets with the required height and width.

3. **Bracket Drawing Logic**:
   - When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the program places `+` and `-` characters at the top and bottom of the current level, and `|` characters to connect them vertically.
   - When encountering a closing bracket `]`, the program completes the current bracket by placing `+` and `-` characters and adjusting the position accordingly.

4. **Handling Consecutive Closing Brackets**: The program correctly handles consecutive closing brackets by continuing to move the position until it finds a non-closing bracket, ensuring that the drawing remains compact and aligned.

5. **Output**: The program prints the `drawing` row by row, producing the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure.

Given the provided execution summary and the test cases, the program appears to handle all edge cases and produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
