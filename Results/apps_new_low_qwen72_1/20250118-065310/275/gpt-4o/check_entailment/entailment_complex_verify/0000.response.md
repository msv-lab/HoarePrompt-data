Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the spacing between consecutive brackets as required by the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to insert a single space between consecutive brackets, which results in the brackets visually merging into one symbol. This is evident in the examples provided in the problem description, where brackets are clearly separated by spaces when they appear consecutively. The provided program, however, does not implement this spacing, leading to incorrect output.

For instance, with the input:
```
8
[[][]][]
```
The expected output should be:
```
+-        -++- -+
|+- -++- -+||   |
||   ||   |||   |
|+- -++- -+||   |
+-        -++- -+
```
However, the program will produce an output without the necessary spaces between the brackets, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect due to the lack of proper spacing between consecutive brackets is accurate.

Final: **False**
