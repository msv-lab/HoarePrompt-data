Reasoning:

1. **Level Calculation**: The program accurately calculates the depth of nested brackets by iterating through the input sequence and adjusting the `current_level` variable. It also maintains a `levels` list to keep track of the number of open brackets at each level. However, the `levels` list is not necessary for the drawing process and could be optimized out, but it does not affect the correctness of the drawing.

2. **Drawing Initialization**: The program initializes a 2D list `drawing` with dimensions `(2 * max_level + 1) x (2 * n)`, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements. This ensures that there is enough space to draw the brackets in the required format.

3. **Bracket Drawing**:
   - When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the program correctly places the `+`, `-`, and `|` characters to represent the start of a new bracket.
   - When encountering a closing bracket `]`, the program correctly places the `+`, `-`, and `|` characters to represent the end of a bracket.
   - The program adjusts the `current_level` and `pos` variables to keep track of the current position in the drawing, ensuring that the drawing is constructed correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles various edge cases effectively:
   - Nested brackets are drawn with the correct nesting levels.
   - Consecutive brackets are separated by a single space, as required.
   - The program ensures that the drawing has the minimum possible height.

5. **Output**: The program prints the drawing row by row, ensuring that the output is formatted correctly without unnecessary spaces.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
