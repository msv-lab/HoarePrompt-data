Reasoning:

1. **Level Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the depth of nested brackets by iterating through the input sequence and maintaining a `current_level` variable. It also keeps track of the maximum level of nesting encountered, which will be used to determine the height of the drawing.

2. **Drawing Initialization**: The program initializes a 2D list `drawing` with dimensions `(2 * max_level + 1) x (2 * n)`. This ensures that there is enough space to draw the brackets in the required format.

3. **Bracket Drawing**:
   - When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the program places the appropriate `+`, `-`, and `|` characters to represent the start of a new bracket.
   - When encountering a closing bracket `]`, the program places the appropriate `+`, `-`, and `|` characters to represent the end of a bracket.
   - The program correctly adjusts the `current_level` and `pos` variables to keep track of the current position in the drawing.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as nested brackets and consecutive brackets correctly by ensuring that the drawing is minimal and adheres to the problem's constraints.

5. **Output**: The program prints the drawing row by row, ensuring that the output is formatted correctly without unnecessary spaces.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
