Reasoning:

The provided program aims to draw a sequence of square brackets using ASCII art based on the given rules. Let's break down the program to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `sequence`. It ensures that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `sequence` is a regular sequence of brackets.

2. **Level Calculation**: The program calculates the levels of nesting in the bracket sequence. This is done by iterating through the sequence and incrementing or decrementing the `current_level` based on whether a `[` or `]` is encountered. The `levels` list keeps track of the number of open brackets at each level. This part of the program is correct and necessary for determining the maximum depth of the brackets.

3. **Drawing Initialization**: The program initializes a 2D list `drawing` with dimensions `(2 * max_level + 1) x (2 * n)` filled with spaces. This is correct because the height of the drawing should be twice the maximum level plus one (to account for the top and bottom rows).

4. **Drawing Logic**: The program iterates through the sequence again to fill in the `drawing` list with the appropriate characters (`+`, `-`, `|`). The logic for placing these characters is as follows:
   - When encountering `[`, it places `+` at the current level and the corresponding mirrored position, `-` on both sides, and `|` vertically.
   - When encountering `]`, it places `+` and `-` to close the bracket and `|` to connect the vertical lines.
   - The program also handles the positioning correctly by adjusting `pos` and `current_level`.

5. **Output**: The program prints each row of the `drawing` list, which should result in the correct ASCII representation of the bracket sequence.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to correctly handle the input, calculate the levels, initialize the drawing, and place the characters as required. The program's logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
