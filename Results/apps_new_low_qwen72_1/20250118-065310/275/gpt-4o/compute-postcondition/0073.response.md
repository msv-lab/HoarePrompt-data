The code snippet `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Given the initial state, `pos` starts at 1. After executing the code, `pos` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is -1, `pos` is 2, and `sequence[1]` must be ']'**
