Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \ \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `pos` is the index of the last ']' character processed plus 1, and `pos` is less than `2 * n`. The loop executes as long as `pos` is less than `2 * n` and `sequence[pos]` is `']'`. If no more ']' characters are found or `pos` reaches `2 * n`, the loop does not execute further.**

Explanation:
- **Variables that remain constant**: `n`, `sequence`, `levels`, `max_level`, `drawing` (except for the changes made within the loop conditions).
- **Final values of all variables**:
  - `n`: Remains the same as it is not modified.
  - `sequence`: Remains the same as it is not modified.
  - `levels`: Remains an empty list as it is not modified.
  - `max_level`: Remains 0 as it is not modified.
  - `drawing`: Remains a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, but specific positions are modified based on the loop's conditions.
  - `char`: The next character in `sequence` after the loop ends.
  - `pos`: The index of the last ']' character processed plus 1.
- **Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute**:
  - The loop executes as long as `pos` is less than `2 * n` and the character at `sequence[pos]` is `']'`.
  - The loop does not execute if `pos` reaches `2 * n` or if the character at `sequence[pos]` is not `']'`.
