The value of `pos` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `pos` is 3, so after executing the code, `pos` becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `sequence[1]` is ']', `sequence[3]` is ']', `levels` is an empty list, `current_level` is -1, `pos` is 4, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces where `drawing[1][0]` is '-', `drawing[1][-1]` is '+', and `drawing[0][-1]` is '|', `char` is ']'**
