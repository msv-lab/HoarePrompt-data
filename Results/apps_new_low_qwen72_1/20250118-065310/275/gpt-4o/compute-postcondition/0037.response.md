The value of `current_level` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `sequence`, `char`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `current_level` is `current_level + 1`**
