To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions given:

1. The loop condition is `len(levels) < current_level`.
2. Before the loop, `levels` is an empty list (`[]`).
3. `current_level` is 1.

Given these conditions:
- The length of `levels` is 0 (since `levels` is an empty list).
- `current_level` is 1.

For the loop to execute, the condition `len(levels) < current_level` must be true. Since `len(levels)` is 0 and `current_level` is 1, the condition `0 < 1` is true.

Therefore, the loop will execute at least once without any modifications to the state.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is [], `current_level` is 1, `char` is the first character in `sequence`, and the current value of `char` is '['**
