The code snippet `levels.append(0)` adds a new element, which is `0`, to the end of the list `levels`. This operation increases the length of `levels` by 1. Given that `len(levels)` was previously equal to `current_level`, after appending `0`, `len(levels)` is now equal to `current_level + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is `current_level + 1`, `levels` is updated to include an additional `0` at the end, `len(levels)` is now equal to `current_level + 1`.
