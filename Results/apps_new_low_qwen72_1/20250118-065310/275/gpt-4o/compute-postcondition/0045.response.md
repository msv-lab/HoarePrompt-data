The code snippet `levels[current_level - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `current_level - 1` in the list `levels` by 1. This means that the element at position `current_level - 1` in the list `levels` is increased by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters
- `char` is the next character in `sequence`
- `len(levels)` is equal to `current_level`
- `levels` is a list with `current_level` elements, each initialized to 0

After executing the code snippet, the value at the index `current_level - 1` in the list `levels` is incremented by 1. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `len(levels)` is equal to `current_level`, `levels` is a list with `current_level` elements, each initialized to 0 except `levels[current_level - 1]` which is now 1.**
