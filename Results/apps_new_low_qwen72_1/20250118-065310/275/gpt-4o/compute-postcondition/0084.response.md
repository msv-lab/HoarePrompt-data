To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while pos < 2 * n and sequence[pos] == ']':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `pos < 2 * n`**
   - This condition ensures that `pos` is within the bounds of the sequence. Given that `sequence` is a string of length `n`, and `pos` is incremented during the loop, this condition checks if `pos` has not yet reached the end of the sequence (which is `2 * n` because each character in `sequence` is processed twice).

2. **Condition 2: `sequence[pos] == ']'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at the current position `pos` in the `sequence` is a closing bracket `']'`.

### Initial State Analysis:

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
  - `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets.
  - `levels` is an empty list.
  - `max_level` is 0.
  - `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces.
  - `char` is the next character in `sequence`.
  - `pos` is `pos + 1`.
  - `current_level` is `current_level - 1`.
  - `drawing[current_level][pos]` is '-'.
  - `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos]` is '-'.
  - `drawing[current_level][pos - 1]` is '+'.
  - `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos - 1]` is '+'.
  - `drawing[current_level + 1][pos - 1]` is '|'.
  - `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level - 1][pos - 1]` is '|'.

### Ensuring the Loop Executes:

- **`pos < 2 * n`**: 
  - For the loop to start, `pos` must be less than `2 * n`. Since `pos` is `pos + 1`, it must be initialized to a value less than `2 * n - 1` for the loop to run at least once.

- **`sequence[pos] == ']'`**:
  - The character at `pos` in `sequence` must be a closing bracket `']'`. Given that `sequence` is a regular sequence of brackets, it must contain balanced pairs of '[' and ']'. Therefore, the first character in `sequence` must be a closing bracket `']'` for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must be met:
- `pos` must be less than `2 * n`.
- The character at `pos` in `sequence` must be `']'`.

Given the initial state, `pos` is `pos + 1`, so `pos` must be initialized to a value less than `2 * n - 1`. Additionally, the first character in `sequence` must be `']'` for the loop to execute.

Since `sequence` is a regular sequence of brackets, the first character being `']'` is not typical. However, for the loop to execute, the first character must indeed be `']'`.

### Final State:

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `pos` is less than `2 * n - 1`, and `sequence[pos]` is `']'`**
