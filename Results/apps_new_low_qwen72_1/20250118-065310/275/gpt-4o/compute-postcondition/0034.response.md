The value of `current_level` is decremented by 1. Since `char` is ']', this indicates that `current_level` was previously incremented due to a '[' character. The list `levels` is also updated based on the previous `char`, which means if `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, it is removed from the list, reducing the length of `levels` by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is ']', `current_level` is `current_level - 1`, if `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, `levels` has one less element.**
