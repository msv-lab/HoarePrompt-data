The code `levels.pop()` removes the last element from the list `levels`. Given the initial state, the element at index `current_level - 1` in `levels` is 0, and this element will be removed. The value of `current_level` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `sequence`, `char`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` has one less element, `current_level` is unchanged, `char` is ']'.**
