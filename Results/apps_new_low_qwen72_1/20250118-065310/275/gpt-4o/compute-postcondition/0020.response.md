The value of `current_level` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `sequence`, `char`, and `levels`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `n`, `sequence`, and the nature of `char` and `levels` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is `current_level + 1`, `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`**
