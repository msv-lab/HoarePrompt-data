For the loop to execute the first time, the conditions that must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head are:

- `sequence` must be a non-empty string. Since `n` is given as an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and `sequence` is a string of length `n`, `sequence` will always contain at least one character (in fact, at least two characters, since the minimum value of `n` is 2). Therefore, `sequence` will always be non-empty when the loop starts.
- `char` will be the first character of `sequence` when the loop starts.

Given these conditions, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `sequence` is a valid string with at least one character, and `char` will be the first character of `sequence`.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is 0, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the first character of `sequence`**
