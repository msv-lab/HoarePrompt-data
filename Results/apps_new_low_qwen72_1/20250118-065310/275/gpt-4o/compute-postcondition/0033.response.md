Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` and is ']', `current_level` is updated based on the previous `char`, `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`. If `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, `levels[current_level - 1]` is no longer present, and `levels` has one less element.***
