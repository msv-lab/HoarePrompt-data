The provided code snippet updates the `drawing` based on the current state of `current_level`, `max_level`, and `pos`. It modifies the `drawing` at specific indices based on the logic described. Let's break down the combined effect of the code:

1. **Decrement `current_level` by 1**: This line reduces the current level by 1, indicating that we are moving out of a nested structure in the bracket sequence.
2. **Update `drawing` with '-' characters**: Two positions in the `drawing` are updated with '-' characters at the current level and the mirrored level (2 * max_level - current_level).
3. **Update `drawing` with '+' characters**: Two positions in the `drawing` are updated with '+' characters at the positions just before the current position (`pos - 1`) at the current level and the mirrored level.
4. **Update `drawing` with '|' characters**: Two positions in the `drawing` are updated with '|' characters at the positions just before the current position (`pos - 1`) at the levels one below the current level and the mirrored level.
5. **Increment `pos` by 1**: This line moves the position forward by 1, preparing for the next character in the sequence.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets
- `levels` is an empty list
- `max_level` is 0
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces
- `current_level` is initially 0
- `pos` is initially 0

After executing the provided code snippet, the final state will be:

Output State: **n is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), sequence is a string of length n consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, levels is an empty list, max_level is 0, drawing is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, current_level is -1, pos is 1, and the following positions in drawing are updated:
- drawing[-1][1] = '-'
- drawing[1][1] = '-'
- drawing[-1][0] = '+'
- drawing[1][0] = '+'
- drawing[0][0] = '|'
- drawing[0][0] = '|'**

Note: The negative index `-1` for `current_level` indicates an out-of-bounds access, which would typically raise an error in Python. However, for the purpose of this simulation, we assume it is handled or ignored, and the state is as described.
