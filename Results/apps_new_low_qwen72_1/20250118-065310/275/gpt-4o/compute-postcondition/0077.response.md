`pos` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged. The specific conditions and values for `n`, `sequence`, `levels`, `max_level`, `drawing`, and `current_level` are still valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is -1, `pos` is 4, and `sequence[3]` must be `']'`**
