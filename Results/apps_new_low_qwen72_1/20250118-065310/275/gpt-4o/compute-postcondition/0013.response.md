The code `levels[current_level - 1] -= 1` decrements the value at the index `current_level - 1` of the list `levels` by 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `n` remains an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` remains a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- `levels` is initially an empty list, but since we are trying to access and modify an element at index `current_level - 1`, this implies that `current_level` must be at least 1 (since `current_level - 1` must be a valid index in `levels`). However, the exact values in `levels` before this operation are not specified.
- `current_level` remains unchanged.
- `char` remains the first character in `sequence`, which is ']'.

Since `current_level` is at least 1, `current_level - 1` is a valid index in `levels`. The value at this index in `levels` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` has its element at index `current_level - 1` decremented by 1, `current_level` is unchanged, `char` is ']'**.
