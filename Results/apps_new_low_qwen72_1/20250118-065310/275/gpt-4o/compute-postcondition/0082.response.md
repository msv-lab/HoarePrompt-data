The provided code snippet modifies several elements in the `drawing` list based on the current values of `current_level` and `pos`, and updates `current_level` and `pos` accordingly. Here's the detailed analysis:

- The first two lines set the characters at positions `[current_level][pos]` and `[2 * max_level - current_level][pos]` in the `drawing` list to `'+'`.
- The next two lines set the characters at positions `[current_level][pos + 1]` and `[2 * max_level - current_level][pos + 1]` in the `drawing` list to `'-'`.
- The following two lines set the characters at positions `[current_level + 1][pos]` and `[2 * max_level - current_level - 1][pos]` in the `drawing` list to `'|'`.
- Finally, `current_level` is incremented by 1, and `pos` is also incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets.
- `levels` is an empty list.
- `max_level` is 0.
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces.
- `char` is the next character in `sequence`.
- `pos` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code block, the updated state is:

Output State: **n is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` has the following modifications:
- `drawing[current_level][pos]` is '+'.
- `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos]` is '+'.
- `drawing[current_level][pos + 1]` is '-'.
- `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos + 1]` is '-'.
- `drawing[current_level + 1][pos]` is '|'.
- `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level - 1][pos]` is '|'.
- `current_level` is `current_level + 1`.
- `pos` is `pos + 1`.**
