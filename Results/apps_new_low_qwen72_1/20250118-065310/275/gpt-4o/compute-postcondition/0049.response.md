The `levels.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `levels` list. Given that `levels[current_level - 1]` was just decreased by 1 and its current value is 0, this indicates that the last element in the `levels` list is 0. After popping, the `levels` list will no longer contain this 0.

The other variables (`n`, `sequence`, `char`) remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the `pop()` operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is ']', `levels` has one less element, and the last element removed was 0.**
