The code snippet `print(''.join(row))` prints the first row of the `drawing` list, which is a string of 2 * n spaces.

- The value of `n` remains an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- The value of `sequence` remains a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- The value of `levels` remains an empty list.
- The value of `max_level` remains the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`.
- The value of `drawing` remains a list with one row of 2 * n spaces.
- The value of `current_level` remains 0.
- The value of `pos` remains 0.
- The value of `row` remains the first row in `drawing`.

The only action performed by the code is printing the first row of `drawing`, which is a string of 2 * n spaces.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is 0, `row` is the first row in `drawing`**
