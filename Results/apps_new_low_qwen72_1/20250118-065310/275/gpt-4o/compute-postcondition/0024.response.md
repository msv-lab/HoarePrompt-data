The code snippet `levels.append(0)` appends a `0` to the list `levels`. This means the list `levels` now includes an additional `0` at the end. The length of `levels` is incremented by 1, which matches the new value of `current_level`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is `current_level + 1`, `levels` is updated to include an additional `0` at the end, `len(levels)` is now equal to `current_level`**
