To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for char in sequence:
```

The variables involved in the loop head are:
- `char`: The current character being processed from `sequence`.
- `sequence`: The string of brackets being iterated over.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets.
- `levels` is an empty list.
- `max_level` is 0.
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces.
- `current_level` is the current level of nested brackets.
- `pos` is the current position in the `sequence`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `sequence` must be available. Since `sequence` is a string of length `n`, the loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `sequence`.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, the next state for the loop to execute one more time would be:

- `char` is the next character in `sequence`.
- `pos` is incremented by 1 to point to the next character in `sequence`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `pos` is incremented by 1**.
