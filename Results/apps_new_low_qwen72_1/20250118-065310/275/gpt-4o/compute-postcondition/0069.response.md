The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `sequence`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates over each character in the `sequence` string. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was either '[' or ']', depending on the current position in the sequence.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `sequence` must still have characters left to iterate over, and `char` should be set to the next character in the `sequence`.

Given that `pos` is the index of the last processed character, for the next iteration, `pos` would increment by 1. However, since we are only adjusting the states in the loop head, we focus on the next character in `sequence`.

If `char` was '[' at the end of the last iteration, it means the next character in `sequence` could be either '[' or ']'. Similarly, if `char` was ']' at the end of the last iteration, the next character could also be either '[' or ']'.

Since `pos` is not part of the loop head, we don't directly adjust it, but it implicitly increases by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces. If the next `char` in `sequence` is '[', `current_level` will be incremented by 1, `pos` will be incremented by 1, and the corresponding positions in `drawing` will be updated. If the next `char` in `sequence` is ']', `current_level` will be decremented by 1, `pos` will be incremented by 1, and the corresponding positions in `drawing` will be updated.**
