To determine what must hold true for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop head: `len(levels) < current_level`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
   - `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']').
   - `current_level` is `current_level + 1`.
   - `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `len(levels) < current_level`.

3. **Current Level**:
   - The state specifies that `current_level` is `current_level + 1`. This implies that `current_level` has already been incremented by 1.

4. **Levels**:
   - The state mentions that `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`. However, the exact nature of this update is not specified, but we can infer that `levels` is a list or collection that is modified as the program runs.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute, `len(levels)` must be less than `current_level`.
   - Since `current_level` is `current_level + 1`, the loop will execute if `len(levels)` is less than the new value of `current_level`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, `len(levels)` must be less than `current_level` after `current_level` has been incremented. Given that `current_level` is incremented by 1, the loop will execute if `len(levels)` is less than or equal to the original `current_level`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is `current_level + 1`, `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`, and `len(levels)` must be less than the new `current_level`**.
