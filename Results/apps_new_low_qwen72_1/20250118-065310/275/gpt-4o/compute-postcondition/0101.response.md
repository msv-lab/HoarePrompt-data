The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `sequence`. `n` is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets. The function returns whether the `sequence` is a valid regular sequence of brackets.

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `sequence` of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters. It returns `True` if the `sequence` is a valid regular sequence of brackets, otherwise it returns `False`.**
