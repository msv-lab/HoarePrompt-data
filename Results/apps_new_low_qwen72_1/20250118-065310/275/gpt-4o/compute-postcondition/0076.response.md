To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while pos < 2 * n and sequence[pos] == ']':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `pos` and `sequence`.

2. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - `pos < 2 * n`: This condition ensures that `pos` is within the bounds of the `sequence` string, which has a length of `2 * n`.
   - `sequence[pos] == ']': This condition checks if the character at position `pos` in the `sequence` string is a closing bracket `']'`.

3. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
   - `levels` is an empty list.
   - `max_level` is 0.
   - `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces.
   - `current_level` is -1.
   - `pos` is 3.
   - `sequence[1]` must be ']'.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `pos` must be less than `2 * n` and `sequence[pos]` must be `']'`.
   - Given that `pos` is 3, we need to ensure that `sequence[3]` is `']'` and `pos` is still less than `2 * n`.

5. **Verification**:
   - Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `2 * n` will be an even number between 4 and 200.
   - `pos` is 3, which is less than any possible value of `2 * n` (since the minimum value of `2 * n` is 4).
   - We need to ensure that `sequence[3]` is `']'`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `sequence[3]` is `']'`. All other conditions are already satisfied.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is -1, `pos` is 3, and `sequence[3]` must be `']'`**.
