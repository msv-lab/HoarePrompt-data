The `print(''.join(row))` command concatenates all elements in the `row` list into a single string and prints it. The `row` variable refers to the second row in the `drawing` list, which is a list containing two rows of 2 * n spaces.

Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `drawing` is a list with two rows of 2 * n spaces, the second row (`row`) contains 2 * n spaces. The `print` statement will print these spaces as a single string.

The values of the variables `n`, `sequence`, `levels`, `max_level`, `drawing`, `current_level`, `pos`, and `row` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with two rows of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is 0, `row` is the second row in `drawing`. A string of 2 * n spaces has been printed.**
