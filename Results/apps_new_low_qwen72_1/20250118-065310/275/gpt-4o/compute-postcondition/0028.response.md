The given code snippet modifies the `levels` list by incrementing the value at the index `current_level - 1` by 1. This means that the element at the position corresponding to the last level in the `levels` list is incremented.

- `n` remains an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` remains a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- `char` remains the next character in `sequence` (either '[' or ']').
- `current_level` remains unchanged as the final value of `current_level` after the loop.
- `levels` is a list of length `current_level` where each element is `0` before the execution of the code. After the execution, the element at the index `current_level - 1` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is the final value of `current_level` after the loop, `levels` is a list of length `current_level` where each element is `0` except the element at index `current_level - 1` which is now `1`.
Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is the final value of `current_level` after the loop, `levels` is a list of length `current_level` where each element is `0` except the element at index `current_level - 1` which is now `1`.**
