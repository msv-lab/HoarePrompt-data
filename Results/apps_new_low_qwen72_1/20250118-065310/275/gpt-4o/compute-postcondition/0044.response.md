Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `len(levels)` is equal to `current_level`, `levels` is a list with `current_level` elements, each initialized to 0.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop condition is `while len(levels) < current_level:`. This means the loop will continue to run as long as the length of the `levels` list is less than `current_level`.
   - Inside the loop, `levels.append(0)` adds a zero to the `levels` list each time the loop runs.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n`, `sequence`, and `char` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `current_level` is assumed to be an invariant because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `levels` is modified by appending a zero each time the loop runs.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop appends zeros to `levels` until `len(levels)` equals `current_level`.
   - If `current_level` is 1, the loop will run once.
   - If `current_level` is 2, the loop will run twice.
   - Generally, if `current_level` is `k`, the loop will run `k` times.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop completes, `len(levels)` will be equal to `current_level`.
   - Each element in `levels` will be 0.
   - The loop will not execute if `len(levels)` is already equal to or greater than `current_level`.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has finished executing is:
- `n` remains an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` remains a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- `char` remains the next character in `sequence`.
- `len(levels)` is equal to `current_level`.
- `levels` is a list with `current_level` elements, each initialized to 0.
