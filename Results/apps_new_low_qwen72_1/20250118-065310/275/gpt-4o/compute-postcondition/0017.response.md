The code `current_level -= 1` decrements the value of `current_level` by 1. This impacts only the `current_level` variable, while the other variables remain unchanged.

- `n` is still an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is still a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- `current_level` is decremented by 1.
- `char` is still ']'.
- If `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, then `levels` has one less element. Otherwise, `levels[current_level - 1]` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `current_level` is decremented by 1, `char` is ']', if `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, then `levels` has one less element, otherwise `levels[current_level - 1]` is decremented by 1.**
