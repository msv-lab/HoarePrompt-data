The value of `pos` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `pos` is less than `2 * n`, and `sequence[pos-1]` is `']'`.
