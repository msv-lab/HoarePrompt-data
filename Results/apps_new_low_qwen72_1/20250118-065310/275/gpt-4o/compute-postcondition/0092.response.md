Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, and `pos` is incremented by 1. If `char` is '[', `drawing[current_level][pos]` is '+', `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos]` is '+', `drawing[current_level][pos + 1]` is '-', `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos + 1]` is '-', `drawing[current_level + 1][pos]` is '|', `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level - 1][pos]` is '|', `current_level` is incremented by 1, and `pos` is incremented by 1. If `char` is ']', `pos` is the index of the last ']' character processed.***
