To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the condition of the `while` loop.

### Given State:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- `char` is the next character in `sequence`.
- `current_level` is `current_level + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while len(levels) < current_level:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the length of `levels` is less than `current_level`.
2. **Initial State of `current_level`**: The problem states that `current_level` is `current_level + 1`. This implies that `current_level` is being incremented by 1 from some initial value. However, the initial value of `current_level` is not explicitly given. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(levels)` must be less than this new value of `current_level`.

### Required State:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must be true:
- `len(levels)` must be less than `current_level`.

Since `current_level` is incremented by 1, the loop will execute if the initial value of `current_level` (let's call it `initial_current_level`) is such that `len(levels) < initial_current_level + 1`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes the first time, `len(levels)` must be less than `initial_current_level + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `len(levels)` must be less than `current_level`**.
