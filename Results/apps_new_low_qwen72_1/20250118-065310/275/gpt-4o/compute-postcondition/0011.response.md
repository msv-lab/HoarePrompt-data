The code snippet `levels[current_level - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `current_level - 1` of the list `levels` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters
- `levels` is [0]
- `current_level` is 1
- `char` is the first character in `sequence`, and the current value of `char` is '['

The index `current_level - 1` evaluates to 0. Therefore, the value at index 0 of `levels` (which is 0) is incremented by 1, making `levels` equal to [1].

The rest of the variables (`n`, `sequence`, `current_level`, `char`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is [1], `current_level` is 1, `char` is the first character in `sequence`, and the current value of `char` is '['**
