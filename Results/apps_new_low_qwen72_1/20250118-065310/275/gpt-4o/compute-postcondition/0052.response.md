Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`. If `char` is '[', `len(levels)` is equal to `current_level`, `levels` is a list with `current_level` elements, each initialized to 0 except `levels[current_level - 1]` which is now 1. If `char` is ']', `levels[current_level - 1]` is decreased by 1. If `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0 after being decreased, the last element (which is 0) is removed from the `levels` list, and `current_level` is decreased by 1.***
