Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, sequence is a string of length n consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, levels is [], current_level is 0
Code of the loop:
for char in sequence:
    if char == '[':
        current_level += 1
        while len(levels) < current_level:
            levels.append(0)
        levels[current_level - 1] += 1
    else:
        levels[current_level - 1] -= 1
        if levels[current_level - 1] == 0:
            levels.pop()
        current_level -= 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters. If `char` is '[', then `levels` is [1], `current_level` is 1, and `char` is the first character in `sequence`. If `char` is ']', then `current_level` is decremented by 1, `char` is ']', and if `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, then `levels` has one less element; otherwise, `levels[current_level - 1]` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`. If `char` is '[', `current_level` is the final value of `current_level` after the loop, and `levels` is a list of length `current_level` where each element is `0` except the element at index `current_level - 1` which is now `1`. If `char` is ']', `current_level` is decremented by 1, and if `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, `levels` has one less element.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`. If `char` is '[', `len(levels)` is equal to `current_level`, `levels` is a list with `current_level` elements, each initialized to 0 except `levels[current_level - 1]` which is now 1. If `char` is ']', `levels[current_level - 1]` is decreased by 1. If `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0 after being decreased, the last element (which is 0) is removed from the `levels` list, and `current_level` is decreased by 1.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
