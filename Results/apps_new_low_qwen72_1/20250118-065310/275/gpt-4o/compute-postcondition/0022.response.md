The code snippet `levels.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list `levels`. This impacts the state of `levels`, increasing its length by 1. Since `len(levels)` must be less than the new `current_level`, appending `0` ensures this condition remains valid. The values of `n`, `sequence`, and `char` remain unchanged. The value of `current_level` is already specified as `current_level + 1`, which means the current level has been incremented by 1. The state of `levels` is updated by adding a `0` to the end of the list.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is `current_level + 1`, `levels` is updated to include an additional `0` at the end, and `len(levels)` is now equal to the new `current_level`**.
