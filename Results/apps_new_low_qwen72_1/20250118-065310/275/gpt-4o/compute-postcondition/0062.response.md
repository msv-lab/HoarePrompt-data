To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while pos < 2 * n and sequence[pos] == ']':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **`pos < 2 * n`**: This condition ensures that the position `pos` is within the bounds of the sequence, which has a length of `2 * n`.
2. **`sequence[pos] == ']'`**: This condition checks if the character at the current position `pos` in the `sequence` is a closing bracket `']'`.

### Current State:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- `sequence[1]` must be ']', which means the second character in the sequence is a closing bracket.
- `levels` is an empty list.
- `current_level` is -1.
- `pos` is 2.
- `max_level` is 0.
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces where `drawing[1][0]` is '-', `drawing[1][-1]` is '+', and `drawing[0][-1]` is '|'.
- `char` is ']'.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`pos`**: The loop will continue as long as `pos` is less than `2 * n` and the character at `sequence[pos]` is `']'`. Since `pos` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `pos` is still within the bounds of the sequence and that the character at `sequence[pos]` is `']'`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `pos` must be incremented to 3 (the next position in the sequence).
- We need to check if `sequence[3]` is `']'`.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition depends on `pos` and `sequence[pos]`, and `pos` is currently 2, the next position to check is `pos = 3`. The state of `sequence` must ensure that `sequence[3]` is `']'` for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `sequence[1]` must be ']', `sequence[3]` must be ']', `levels` is an empty list, `current_level` is -1, `pos` is 3, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces where `drawing[1][0]` is '-', `drawing[1][-1]` is '+', and `drawing[0][-1]` is '|', `char` is ']'**
