The value of `current_level` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is ']', and `levels[current_level - 1]` is decreased by 1. If `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0 after being decreased, the last element (which is 0) is removed from the `levels` list. The decrement of `current_level` does not affect these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is ']', `levels[current_level - 1]` is decreased by 1. If `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0 after being decreased, the last element (which is 0) is removed from the `levels` list, `current_level` is decreased by 1.**
