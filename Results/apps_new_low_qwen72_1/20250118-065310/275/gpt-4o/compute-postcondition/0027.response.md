Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is the final value of `current_level` after the loop, `levels` is a list of length `current_level` where each element is `0`. The loop executes as long as `len(levels) < current_level`, and it appends `0` to `levels` until this condition is no longer true.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues to append `0` to the `levels` list until its length is equal to `current_level`.
   - The initial state includes `n`, `sequence`, `char`, `current_level`, and `levels`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `n`, `sequence`, and `char` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - **Updated Variables**: `levels` grows by appending `0` until its length matches `current_level`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop ensures that `len(levels)` equals `current_level` by the time the loop terminates.
   - Each iteration appends `0` to `levels` if `len(levels) < current_level`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After each iteration, `len(levels)` increases by 1.
   - The loop stops when `len(levels) == current_level`.

Thus, the final output state reflects that `levels` will be a list of length `current_level` with each element being `0`, and the other variables (`n`, `sequence`, and `char`) remain unchanged.
