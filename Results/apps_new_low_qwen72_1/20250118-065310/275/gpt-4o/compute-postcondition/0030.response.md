The value of `levels[current_level - 1]` is decremented by 1. Since `char` is ']', the `current_level` was previously incremented when a '[' was encountered. The decrement operation reflects the closing of a bracket level.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters
- `char` is the next character in `sequence` and is ']'
- `current_level` is updated based on the previous `char`
- `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`
- `levels[current_level - 1]` is decreased by 1

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` and is ']', `current_level` is updated based on the previous `char`, `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`, `levels[current_level - 1]` is decreased by 1**
