To determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time, we need to examine the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while pos < 2 * n and sequence[pos] == ']':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `pos < 2 * n`**
   - `pos` is 1 initially.
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - Therefore, `2 * n` will be at least 4 and at most 200.
   - Since `pos` starts at 1, `pos < 2 * n` will always be true because 1 is less than any value of `2 * n` within the given range.

2. **Condition 2: `sequence[pos] == ']'`**
   - `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
   - `pos` is 1 initially.
   - For the loop to execute, `sequence[1]` (the second character in the string) must be ']'.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the second character in the `sequence` string must be ']', and this is the only condition that needs to be satisfied since `pos < 2 * n` is always true given the initial values.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is -1, `pos` is 1, and `sequence[1]` must be ']'**.
