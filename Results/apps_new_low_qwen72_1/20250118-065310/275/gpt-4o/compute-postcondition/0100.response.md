Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with `max_level + 1` rows of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is `2 * n`, and the `drawing` list contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure in `sequence`, with '+' representing corners, '-' representing horizontal lines, and '|' representing vertical lines.**

Explanation:
- **Invariants**: `n`, `sequence`, `levels`, and `max_level` remain constant throughout the loop.
- **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates through each character in `sequence`, updating `current_level` and `pos` based on whether a '[' or ']' is encountered. It constructs the `drawing` list by adding rows and modifying the characters to represent the bracket structure.
- **Final Values**: After the loop completes, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is `2 * n`, and `drawing` contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure.
- **Conditions**: The loop executes as long as there are characters in `sequence` to process, and it will always complete because `sequence` is guaranteed to be a regular sequence of brackets.
