Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`. If `char` is '[', `current_level` is the final value of `current_level` after the loop, and `levels` is a list of length `current_level` where each element is `0` except the element at index `current_level - 1` which is now `1`. If `char` is ']', `current_level` is decremented by 1, and if `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, `levels` has one less element.***
