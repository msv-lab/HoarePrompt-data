To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets.
- `levels` is an empty list (`[]`).
- `current_level` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for char in sequence:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character in the `sequence` string.
- For the loop to execute the first time, the `sequence` must be non-empty.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. **`sequence` must be non-empty**: Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `sequence` will always have at least one character (in fact, at least two characters). Therefore, `sequence` is guaranteed to be non-empty.
2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
   - `levels` is an empty list (`[]`).
   - `current_level` is 0.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `sequence` must be a non-empty string, which is guaranteed by the condition \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `char` will be the first character in the `sequence`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is [], `current_level` is 0, `char` is the first character in `sequence`**.
