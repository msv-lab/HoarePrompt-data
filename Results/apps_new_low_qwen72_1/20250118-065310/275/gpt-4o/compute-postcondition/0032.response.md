The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `levels`. Since `levels[current_level - 1]` was decreased by 1 and is now 0, the last element of `levels` is removed. This operation affects the length of `levels` and potentially changes the value of `current_level` if it was pointing to the last element.

Given the initial state, the only specific change is the removal of the last element from `levels`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` and is ']', `current_level` is updated based on the previous `char`, `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`, `levels[current_level - 1]` is no longer present, `levels` has one less element.**
