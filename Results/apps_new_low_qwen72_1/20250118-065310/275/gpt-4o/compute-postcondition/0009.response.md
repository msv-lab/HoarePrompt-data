The code appends `0` to the list `levels`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is [0, 0, 0], `current_level` is greater than 2, `char` is the first character in `sequence`, and the current value of `char` is '['**
