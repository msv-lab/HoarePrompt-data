The provided code snippet modifies several variables and elements within the `drawing` list based on the current state. Here's the analysis of the entire block:

- `current_level` is decremented by 1.
- In the `drawing` list:
  - At the position `[current_level][pos]`, the character is set to `'-'`.
  - At the position `[2 * max_level - current_level][pos]`, the character is set to `'-'`.
  - At the position `[current_level][pos - 1]`, the character is set to `'+'`.
  - At the position `[2 * max_level - current_level][pos - 1]`, the character is set to `'+'`.
  - At the position `[current_level + 1][pos - 1]`, the character is set to `'|'`.
  - At the position `[2 * max_level - current_level - 1][pos - 1]`, the character is set to `'|'`.
- The `pos` variable is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets.
- `levels` is an empty list.
- `max_level` is 0.
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces.
- `char` is the next character in `sequence`.
- `pos` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code block:
- `current_level` is now `current_level - 1`.
- The `drawing` list has been updated at specific positions as described above.
- `pos` is now `pos + 1`.

Since the exact values of `current_level`, `pos`, and the content of `drawing` depend on the initial values and the sequence of operations leading up to this point, we can only describe the changes in terms of the initial state and the modifications made.

Output State:
**n is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), sequence is a string of length n consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, levels is an empty list, max_level is 0, drawing is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, char is the next character in sequence, pos is pos + 1, current_level is current_level - 1, drawing[current_level][pos] is '-', drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos] is '-', drawing[current_level][pos - 1] is '+', drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos - 1] is '+', drawing[current_level + 1][pos - 1] is '|', drawing[2 * max_level - current_level - 1][pos - 1] is '|'**
