Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces. If `char` is '[', `current_level` is 1, `pos` is 1, and `drawing[0][0]` is '+', `drawing[0][1]` is '-', and `drawing[1][0]` is '|'. If `char` is ']', `current_level` is -1, `pos` is the index of the last ']' character in the initial series, `drawing[1][0]` is '-', `drawing[1][-1]` is '+', and `drawing[0][-1]` is '|'.***
