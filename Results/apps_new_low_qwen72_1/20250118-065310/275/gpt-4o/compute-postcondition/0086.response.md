To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to look at the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while pos < 2 * n and sequence[pos] == ']':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `pos < 2 * n`**
   - This condition ensures that `pos` is within the bounds of the `sequence` string, which has a length of `2 * n`.
   - Given that `pos` is less than `2 * n` at the end of the previous iteration, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `sequence[pos] == ']'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at position `pos` in the `sequence` string is a closing bracket `']'`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `sequence[pos-1]` is `']'`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sequence[pos]` must also be `']'`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `sequence[pos]` to ensure it is `']'`.
- Since `sequence` is a string and cannot be modified directly, we need to ensure that the next character in `sequence` (i.e., `sequence[pos]`) is `']'`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, the loop will execute one more time if `sequence[pos]` is `']'`. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `sequence[pos-1]` is `']'`, it is reasonable to assume that the next character `sequence[pos]` could also be `']'` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state remains the same, as no further adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `pos` is less than `2 * n`, and `sequence[pos-1]` is `']'`**.
