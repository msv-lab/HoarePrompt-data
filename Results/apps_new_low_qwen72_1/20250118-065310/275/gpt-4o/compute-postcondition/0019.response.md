The only object in the loop head is the variable `char` from the iterable `sequence`, so we can only adjust `char` based on the next character in `sequence`.

At the end of the last iteration, the following is known:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- If `char` is '[', then `levels` is [1], `current_level` is 1, and `char` is the first character in `sequence`.
- If `char` is ']', then `current_level` is decremented by 1, `char` is ']', and if `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, then `levels` has one less element; otherwise, `levels[current_level - 1]` is decremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `sequence` needs to be considered. Since the loop iterates over each character in `sequence`, the next `char` will be the next character in the string.

Given that the current `char` could either be '[' or ']', the next `char` will simply be the subsequent character in `sequence`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next character in `sequence`.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence` (which could be either '[' or ']'), `current_level` is updated based on the previous `char`, and `levels` is updated based on the previous `char` and `current_level`**.
