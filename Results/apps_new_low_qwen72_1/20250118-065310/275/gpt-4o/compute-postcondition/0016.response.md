Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `current_level` is unchanged, `char` is ']'. If `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, then `levels` has one less element. Otherwise, `levels[current_level - 1]` is decremented by 1.***
