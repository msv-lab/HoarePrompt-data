Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters. If `char` is '[', then `levels` is [1], `current_level` is 1, and `char` is the first character in `sequence`. If `char` is ']', then `current_level` is decremented by 1, `char` is ']', and if `levels[current_level - 1]` was 0, then `levels` has one less element; otherwise, `levels[current_level - 1]` is decremented by 1.***
