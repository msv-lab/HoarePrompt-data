The code appends a 0 to the list `levels`. This impacts the length of `levels`, which is now one element longer. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `len(levels)` was initially less than `current_level`, after appending, `len(levels)` is still less than `current_level` because only one element was added.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `len(levels)` is less than `current_level`, `levels` is a list with one more element (0) appended.**
