The variable in the loop head is `len(levels)` and `current_level`. The loop condition checks if `len(levels)` is less than `current_level`. For the loop to execute one more time, `len(levels)` must still be less than `current_level`.

At the end of the last iteration, `len(levels)` was less than `current_level`, and `levels` had one more element (0) appended, which means `len(levels)` increased by 1. To ensure the loop executes again, `current_level` must be greater than the new `len(levels)`.

Since `len(levels)` has increased by 1, `current_level` must be greater than the updated `len(levels)` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `len(levels)` is less than `current_level`, `levels` is a list with one more element (0) appended, and `current_level` must be greater than the new `len(levels)`**
