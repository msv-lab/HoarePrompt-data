The provided code snippet modifies several variables and updates the `drawing` list based on the current state of `current_level` and `pos`. Here's the analysis and the final state:

### Analysis:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
  - `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets.
  - `levels` is an empty list.
  - `max_level` is 0.
  - `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces.
  - `current_level` is initially 0 (assumed from context).
  - `pos` is initially 0 (assumed from context).

- **Code Execution**:
  - The code updates the `drawing` list at specific positions based on the current `current_level` and `pos`.
  - It also increments `current_level` and `pos` by 1 each.

### Final State:
- **`drawing`**: The `drawing` list will be updated as follows:
  - `drawing[current_level][pos]` will be set to '+'.
  - `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos]` will be set to '+'.
  - `drawing[current_level][pos + 1]` will be set to '-'.
  - `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos + 1]` will be set to '-'.
  - `drawing[current_level + 1][pos]` will be set to '|'.
  - `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level - 1][pos]` will be set to '|'.
- **`current_level`**: Will be incremented by 1.
- **`pos`**: Will be incremented by 1.
- **`max_level`**: Remains unchanged at 0 (since no new maximum level is encountered in this snippet).
- **`levels`**: Remains an empty list.
- **`sequence`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged.

### Output State:
**n is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), sequence is a string of length n consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, levels is an empty list, max_level is 0, drawing is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, current_level is 1, pos is 1, drawing[current_level - 1][pos - 1] is '+', drawing[2 * max_level - (current_level - 1)][pos - 1] is '+', drawing[current_level - 1][pos] is '-', drawing[2 * max_level - (current_level - 1)][pos] is '-', drawing[current_level][pos - 1] is '|', drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos - 1] is '|'**

This final state reflects the changes made by the code snippet, including the updates to the `drawing` list and the increments to `current_level` and `pos`.
