Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `sequence` of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters. The function processes the `sequence` to create an ASCII representation of the bracket structure. It constructs a list `drawing` with `2 * max_level + 1` rows and `2 * n` columns, where `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`. Each row in `drawing` is a list of spaces, and the function fills in the appropriate positions with '+', '-', and '|' characters to represent the corners, horizontal lines, and vertical lines of the bracket structure, respectively. After constructing the `drawing`, the function prints each row of the `drawing` to the console. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` remains an even integer within the specified range, `sequence` remains unchanged, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure, `current_level` is 0, and `pos` is `2 * n`. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- The function does not explicitly check if `n` is an even integer within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) or if `sequence` consists only of '[' and ']' characters. If these conditions are not met, the function may behave unpredictably.
- The function does not validate whether the `sequence` is a valid regular sequence of brackets (i.e., every '[' has a corresponding ']'). While the problem statement guarantees this, in practice, the function should ideally include validation to handle invalid sequences.
- The function does not return a value indicating whether the `sequence` is a valid regular sequence of brackets, as suggested by the return postconditions. Instead, it prints the ASCII representation directly to the console. If the function is intended to return a boolean value, this functionality is missing.
