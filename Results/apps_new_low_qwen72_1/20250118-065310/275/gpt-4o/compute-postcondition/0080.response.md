Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces. If the next `char` in `sequence` is '[', `current_level` is incremented by 1, `pos` is incremented by 1, and the corresponding positions in `drawing` are updated as follows: `drawing[current_level - 1][pos - 1]` is '+', `drawing[2 * max_level - (current_level - 1)][pos - 1]` is '+', `drawing[current_level - 1][pos]` is '-', `drawing[2 * max_level - (current_level - 1)][pos]` is '-', `drawing[current_level][pos - 1]` is '|', `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos - 1]` is '|'. If the next `char` in `sequence` is ']', `current_level` is decremented by 1, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `pos` is the smallest index greater than 1 where `sequence[pos]` is not ']', or 2 * n if no such index exists, and all elements in `sequence` up to `pos - 2` are ']'.***
