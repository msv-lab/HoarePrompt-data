The code snippet provided decrements the value of `pos` by 1. Given that `pos` is the index of the last ']' character processed plus 1, decrementing `pos` by 1 moves the position back to the last ']' character that was processed. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `pos` is the index of the last ']' character processed.**
