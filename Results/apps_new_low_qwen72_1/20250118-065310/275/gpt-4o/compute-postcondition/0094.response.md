To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State Before the Loop Starts:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets.
- `levels` is an empty list.
- `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`.
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces.
- After the loop completes, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is `2 * n`, and `drawing` contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure in `sequence`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for row in drawing:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `row` and the list `drawing`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if there are elements in `drawing` to iterate over.

### Required State for the First Execution:
- `drawing` must be a non-empty list. Since `drawing` is described as a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, it must contain at least one row for the loop to execute.
- `row` is a variable that will take the value of each element in `drawing` during each iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `drawing` must be a list with at least one row of 2 * n spaces. The other variables (`n`, `sequence`, `levels`, `max_level`, `current_level`, and `pos`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to start, but they are part of the overall state of the program.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `row` is the first row in `drawing`**.
