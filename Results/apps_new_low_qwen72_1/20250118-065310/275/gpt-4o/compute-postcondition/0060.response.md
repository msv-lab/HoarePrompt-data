To determine if the loop can execute the first time, we need to check the conditions specified in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while pos < 2 * n and sequence[pos] == ']':
```

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **pos < 2 * n**: 
   - `pos` is initially 1.
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - Therefore, `2 * n` is at least 4 and at most 200.
   - Since `pos` is 1, the condition `pos < 2 * n` is always true for any valid `n`.

2. **sequence[pos] == ']':**
   - `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
   - `pos` is 1, so we need to ensure that `sequence[1]` is ']', which is the character at the second position in the string (since indexing starts at 0).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
- `levels` is an empty list.
- `current_level` is -1.
- `pos` is 1.
- `max_level` is 0.
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces where `drawing[1][0]` is '-', `drawing[1][-1]` is '+', and `drawing[0][-1]` is '|'.
- `char` is ']'.

For the loop to execute the first time, `sequence[1]` must be ']'.

Therefore, the modified state to ensure the loop executes the first time is:

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `sequence[1]` must be ']', `levels` is an empty list, `current_level` is -1, `pos` is 1, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces where `drawing[1][0]` is '-', `drawing[1][-1]` is '+', and `drawing[0][-1]` is '|', `char` is ']'**
