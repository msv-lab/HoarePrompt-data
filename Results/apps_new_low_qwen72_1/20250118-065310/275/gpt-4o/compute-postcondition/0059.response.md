Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the final state after executing the entire block of code.

Initial State:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets
- `levels` is an empty list
- `current_level` is 0
- `pos` is 0
- `max_level` is 0
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces
- `char` is the first character of `sequence`, and `char` is ']'

Code Execution:
1. `current_level -= 1`: Decreases `current_level` by 1, making it -1.
2. `drawing[current_level][pos] = '-'`: Sets the character at `drawing[-1][0]` to '-', which is out of bounds (negative index).
3. `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos] = '-'`: Sets the character at `drawing[2 * 0 - (-1)][0]` to '-', which is `drawing[1][0]`.
4. `drawing[current_level][pos - 1] = '+'`: Sets the character at `drawing[-1][-1]` to '+', which is out of bounds (negative indices).
5. `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level][pos - 1] = '+'`: Sets the character at `drawing[1][-1]` to '+', which is out of bounds (negative index).
6. `drawing[current_level + 1][pos - 1] = '|'`: Sets the character at `drawing[0][-1]` to '|', which is out of bounds (negative index).
7. `drawing[2 * max_level - current_level - 1][pos - 1] = '|'`: Sets the character at `drawing[0][-1]` to '|', which is out of bounds (negative index).
8. `pos += 1`: Increments `pos` by 1, making it 1.

Since some of the operations involve out-of-bounds indices, they will raise an `IndexError` if executed in a real Python environment. However, for the purpose of this simulation, we will assume the out-of-bounds operations do not affect the valid parts of the `drawing`.

Final State:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets
- `levels` is an empty list
- `current_level` is -1
- `pos` is 1
- `max_level` is 0
- `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, with the following modifications:
  - `drawing[1][0]` is '-'
  - `drawing[1][-1]` is '+'
  - `drawing[0][-1]` is '|'
- `char` is ']'

Output State: **n is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), sequence is a string of length n consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, levels is an empty list, current_level is -1, pos is 1, max_level is 0, drawing is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces where drawing[1][0] is '-', drawing[1][-1] is '+', and drawing[0][-1] is '|', char is ']'**
