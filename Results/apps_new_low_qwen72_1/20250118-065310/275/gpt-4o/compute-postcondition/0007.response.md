The code snippet `levels.append(0)` adds a 0 to the end of the list `levels`. 

- Initially, `levels` is `[0]`.
- After executing the code, `levels` becomes `[0, 0]`.

The other variables (`n`, `sequence`, `current_level`, and `char`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is [0, 0], `current_level` is 1, `char` is the first character in `sequence`, and the current value of `char` is '['**.
