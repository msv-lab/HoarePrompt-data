The provided code initializes several variables and sets up a structure for further operations, likely related to visualizing or processing the bracket sequence. Let's break down the combined effects of the code block:

- `max_level` is initialized to the length of `levels`, which is 0 (since `levels` is an empty list).
- `drawing` is initialized as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in a 2D grid. The grid has `2 * max_level + 1` rows (which is 1, since `max_level` is 0) and `2 * n` columns, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100.
- `current_level` is set to 0.
- `pos` is set to 0.

Since no modifications are made to `n`, `sequence`, or `levels`, they retain their initial values. The `drawing` grid is initialized with a single row filled with spaces.

Output State: **n is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), sequence is a string of length n consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, levels is an empty list, current_level is 0, pos is 0, max_level is 0, drawing is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces**.
