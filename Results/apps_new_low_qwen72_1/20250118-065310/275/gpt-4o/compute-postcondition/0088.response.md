The variables in the loop head are `pos` and `sequence`, specifically checking if `pos` is less than `2 * n` and if `sequence[pos]` is `']'`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must still hold true after the adjustment.

Given that `pos` is less than `2 * n + 1` and `sequence[pos-1]` is the next character after `']'` in `sequence`, we need to ensure that `pos` is correctly positioned to point to the next `']'` in `sequence`.

Since `pos` is already less than `2 * n + 1` and `sequence[pos-1]` is the next character after `']'`, to ensure the loop condition is met for another iteration, `pos` should be incremented by 1 to point to the next character in `sequence`.

However, since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and `pos` is part of the loop head, we can increment `pos` by 1 to ensure the loop can execute one more time if the next character is indeed `']'`.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `pos` is less than `2 * n + 1`, and `sequence[pos]` is `']'`**
