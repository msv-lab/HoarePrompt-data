The code `levels[current_level - 1] -= 1` decrements the value at the index `current_level - 1` in the list `levels` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is ']', `levels[current_level - 1]` is decreased by 1**
