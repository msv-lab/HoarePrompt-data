The only variables in the loop head are `levels` and `current_level`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `levels` and the value of `current_level`. The loop will execute if the length of `levels` is less than `current_level`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `levels` is [0]
- `current_level` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `levels` (which is 1) must be less than `current_level`. Since `current_level` is 1, no adjustment is needed as the condition is already met.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is [0], `current_level` is 1, `char` is the first character in `sequence`, and the current value of `char` is '['**
