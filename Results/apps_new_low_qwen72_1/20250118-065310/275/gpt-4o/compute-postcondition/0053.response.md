Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `current_level` is 0.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the `sequence`.
   - The `current_level` variable tracks the current depth of nested brackets.
   - The `levels` list keeps track of the count of open brackets at each level.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**:
     - `n` remains constant as it is the length of the `sequence`.
     - `sequence` remains constant as it is the input string.
   - **Changing Variables**:
     - `current_level` increments when encountering `[` and decrements when encountering `]`.
     - `levels` is updated to reflect the count of open brackets at each level.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - When `char` is `[`, `current_level` increases, and the corresponding level in `levels` is incremented.
   - When `char` is `]`, `current_level` decreases, and the corresponding level in `levels` is decremented. If the count at that level becomes zero, the level is removed from `levels`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After processing the entire `sequence`, all open brackets should be closed, meaning `current_level` should return to 0.
   - The `levels` list should be empty because all levels should have been balanced out by closing brackets.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100.
- `sequence` remains the original input string.
- `levels` is an empty list because all levels have been balanced.
- `current_level` is 0 because the sequence is regular and all brackets are properly closed.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `current_level` is 0.**
