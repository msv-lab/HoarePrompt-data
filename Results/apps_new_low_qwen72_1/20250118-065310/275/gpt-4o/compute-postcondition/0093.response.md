Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces. After the loop completes, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is `2 * n`, and `drawing` contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure in `sequence`, with '+' representing corners, '-' representing horizontal lines, and '|' representing vertical lines. The loop executes as long as there are characters in `sequence` to process, and it will always complete because `sequence` is guaranteed to be a regular sequence of brackets, ensuring each '[' has a matching ']'.**
