`current_level` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `current_level` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is [], `current_level` is 1, `char` is the first character in `sequence`, and the current value of `char` is '['.
