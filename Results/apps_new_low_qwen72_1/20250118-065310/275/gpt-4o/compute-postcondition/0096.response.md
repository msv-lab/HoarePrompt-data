The only objects in the loop head are `row` and `drawing`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `drawing` list. If there are more rows in `drawing`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is the first row in `drawing`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `drawing` must have at least two rows, and `row` should be the second row in `drawing`.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with two rows of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is 0, `row` is the second row in `drawing`**
