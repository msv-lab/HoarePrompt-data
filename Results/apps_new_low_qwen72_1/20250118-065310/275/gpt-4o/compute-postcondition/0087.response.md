The value of `pos` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `sequence[pos-1]` was `']'`, `sequence[pos-1]` now refers to the next character in the sequence.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is 0, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `pos` is less than `2 * n + 1`, and `sequence[pos-1]` is the next character after `']'` in `sequence`.**
