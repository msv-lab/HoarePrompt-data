The provided code initializes two variables, `levels` and `current_level`. Since no further operations or modifications are performed on these variables within the given code snippet, their initial values remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 100, and `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets. These variables are not altered by the code provided.

Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, sequence is a string of length n consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, levels is [], current_level is 0**
