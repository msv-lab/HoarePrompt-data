The variables in the loop head are `len(levels)` and `current_level`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `len(levels)` and `current_level`. If `len(levels)` is less than `current_level`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(levels)` is less than `current_level`, and `levels` has one more element (0) appended. This means `len(levels)` has increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `current_level` must be greater than the new `len(levels)`.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `char` is the next character in `sequence`, `len(levels)` is less than `current_level`, `levels` is a list with one more element (0) appended, and `current_level` must be greater than the new `len(levels)`**
