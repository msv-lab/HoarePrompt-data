The code `levels.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list `levels`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is [0], `current_level` is 1, `char` is the first character in `sequence`, and the current value of `char` is '['**
