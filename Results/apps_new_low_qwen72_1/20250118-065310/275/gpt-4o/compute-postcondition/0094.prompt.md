You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head is variable students, index and list student_list so these are the only ones that can control if the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces. After the loop completes, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is `2 * n`, and `drawing` contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure in `sequence`, with '+' representing corners, '-' representing horizontal lines, and '|' representing vertical lines. The loop executes as long as there are characters in `sequence` to process, and it will always complete because `sequence` is guaranteed to be a regular sequence of brackets, ensuring each '[' has a matching ']'.
```
for row in drawing:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.
