    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters representing a regular sequence of brackets, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with one row of 2 * n spaces. After the loop completes, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is `2 * n`, and `drawing` contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure in `sequence`, with '+' representing corners, '-' representing horizontal lines, and '|' representing vertical lines. The loop executes as long as there are characters in `sequence` to process, and it will always complete because `sequence` is guaranteed to be a regular sequence of brackets, ensuring each '[' has a matching ']'.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `sequence` is a string of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` is a list with `max_level + 1` rows of 2 * n spaces, `current_level` is 0, `pos` is `2 * n`, and the `drawing` list contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure in `sequence`, with '+' representing corners, '-' representing horizontal lines, and '|' representing vertical lines.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `sequence` of length `n` consisting of '[' and ']' characters. The function processes the `sequence` to create an ASCII representation of the bracket structure. It constructs a list `drawing` with `2 * max_level + 1` rows and `2 * n` columns, where `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`. Each row in `drawing` is a list of spaces, and the function fills in the appropriate positions with '+', '-', and '|' characters to represent the corners, horizontal lines, and vertical lines of the bracket structure, respectively. After constructing the `drawing`, the function prints each row of the `drawing` to the console. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` remains an even integer within the specified range, `sequence` remains unchanged, `levels` is an empty list, `max_level` is the maximum depth of nested brackets in `sequence`, `drawing` contains the correct ASCII representation of the bracket structure, `current_level` is 0, and `pos` is `2 * n`.
