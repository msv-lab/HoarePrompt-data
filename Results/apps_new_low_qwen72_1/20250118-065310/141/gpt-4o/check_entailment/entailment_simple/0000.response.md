### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins required to extend the scopes of antennas so that they collectively cover all integer positions from 1 to \( m \). The program uses dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum cost to cover each position.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input and parses it into the variables \( n \) (number of antennas), \( m \) (range to cover), and a list of tuples representing the positions and initial scopes of the antennas.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A DP array `dp` is initialized with `float('inf')` to represent the minimum cost to cover each position from 0 to \( m \). The value `dp[0]` is set to 0 because no cost is needed to cover position 0 (which is not part of the required range but helps in the DP initialization).

3. **Sorting Antennas:**
   - The list of antennas is sorted by their positions. This ensures that the program processes antennas in a logical order, which is crucial for the DP approach.

4. **Dynamic Programming Loop:**
   - For each antenna \((x, s)\):
     - The range \([left, right]\) is determined where the antenna can cover without any extension.
     - The DP array is updated for the range \([left, right + 1]\) to ensure that the minimum cost to cover these positions is tracked.
     - For positions beyond the current antenna's range, the DP array is updated to account for the additional cost of extending the antenna's scope.

5. **Final Result:**
   - The program returns `dp[m]` if it is not infinity, indicating that the entire range from 1 to \( m \) can be covered. If `dp[m]` is infinity, it means it is impossible to cover the entire range, and the program returns -1.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The input is correctly parsed and stored in the appropriate variables.
  - The antennas are correctly sorted, which is essential for the DP approach.

- **Correctness of DP Initialization:**
  - The DP array is initialized with `float('inf')` and `dp[0]` is set to 0, which is correct for the DP approach.

- **Correctness of DP Updates:**
  - The range \([left, right]\) is correctly calculated for each antenna.
  - The DP array is updated for the range \([left, right + 1]\) to reflect the minimum cost to cover these positions.
  - The DP array is also updated for positions beyond the current antenna's range, considering the cost of extending the antenna's scope.

- **Correctness of Final Result:**
  - The program correctly returns `dp[m]` if it is not infinity, indicating the minimum cost to cover the entire range.
  - If `dp[m]` is infinity, the program returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to cover the entire range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically sound and follows the correct approach to solve the problem using dynamic programming. There are no apparent issues in the implementation that would lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
