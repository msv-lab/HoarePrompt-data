Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where the antennas' coverage needs to be extended to cover all positions from 1 to m optimally. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the function `func_1` has a logical flaw in the way it updates the DP table.

The issue lies in the following part of the code:
```python
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))
```

This part of the code attempts to update the DP table for positions beyond the current antenna's coverage (`right`). However, the expression `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to extend the coverage. It incorrectly assumes that extending the coverage by `(j - right)` units will always result in the minimum cost, which is not necessarily true.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
2 10
5 2
8 2
```

Expected output: 1
- The first antenna covers `[3, 7]`.
- The second antenna covers `[6, 10]`.
- To cover the entire range `[1, 10]`, we only need to extend the first antenna by 1 unit to cover position 1.

However, the provided program will output a higher cost because it incorrectly calculates the extension cost.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve properly calculating the minimum cost to extend the coverage of each antenna to cover all positions from 1 to m. This typically involves a more sophisticated DP or greedy algorithm that correctly handles the extension costs.

Given this counterexample, the program is incorrect.
