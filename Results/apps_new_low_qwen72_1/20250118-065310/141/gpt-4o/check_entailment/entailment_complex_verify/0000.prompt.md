You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the $(Ox)$ axis.

On this street, there are $n$ antennas, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th antenna lies on the position $x_i$ and has an initial scope of $s_i$: it covers all integer positions inside the interval $[x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i]$.

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by $1$, this operation costs $1$ coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside $[1; m]$, even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 80$ and $n \le m \le 100\ 000$).

The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $s_i$ ($1 \le x_i \le m$ and $0 \le s_i \le m$).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values $x_i$ are pairwise distinct).


-----Output-----

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

-----Note-----

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  Increase the scope of the first antenna by $40$, so that it becomes $2 + 40 = 42$. This antenna will cover interval $[43 - 42; 43 + 42]$ which is $[1; 85]$  Increase the scope of the second antenna by $210$, so that it becomes $4 + 210 = 214$. This antenna will cover interval $[300 - 214; 300 + 214]$, which is $[86; 514]$  Increase the scope of the third antenna by $31$, so that it becomes $10 + 31 = 41$. This antenna will cover interval $[554 - 41; 554 + 41]$, which is $[513; 595]$ 

Total cost is $40 + 210 + 31 = 281$. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from $1$ to $595$ covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions $513$ and $514$ are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval $[0; 2]$ so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position $1$; positions $0$ and $2$ are covered, but it's not important.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \). The `dp` array has been updated such that for each antenna \((x, s)\) in `antennas`, the range `[left, right]` is defined as \(\max(0, x - s)\) to \(\min(m, x + s)\). For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`. For each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`. The loop iterates through all `n` antennas, and the `dp` array reflects the minimum values based on the signal ranges of all antennas. The loop will not execute further once all `n` antennas have been processed.
    return dp[m] if dp[m] != float('inf') else -1
    #The program returns `dp[m]` if `dp[m]` is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1. Here, `dp[m]` represents the minimum cost calculated for covering the entire range up to `m` using the signal ranges of the antennas, based on the updates made during the iteration over all `n` antennas.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `antennas`. It aims to determine the minimum cost to cover the range from 0 to `m` using the signal ranges of the given antennas. Each antenna is represented by a tuple `(x_i, s_i)`, where `x_i` is the position and `s_i` is the signal strength. The function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to infinity, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0. It then sorts the `antennas` list based on their positions. For each antenna `(x, s)` in the sorted list, the function updates the `dp` array to reflect the minimum cost to cover the range `[left, right]` where `left = max(0, x - s)` and `right = min(m, x + s)`. Additionally, it updates the `dp` array for positions beyond `right` to account for the cost of extending coverage. Finally, the function returns `dp[m]` if it is not infinity, indicating the minimum cost to cover the entire range up to `m`; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to cover the range with the given antennas. Edge cases include scenarios where no antenna can cover the entire range, or where the range `m` is less than the position of any antenna, leading to the function returning -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where the antennas' coverage needs to be extended to cover all positions from 1 to m optimally. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the function `func_1` has a logical flaw in the way it updates the DP table.

The issue lies in the following part of the code:
```python
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))
```

This part of the code attempts to update the DP table for positions beyond the current antenna's coverage (`right`). However, the expression `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to extend the coverage. It incorrectly assumes that extending the coverage by `(j - right)` units will always result in the minimum cost, which is not necessarily true.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
2 10
5 2
8 2
```

Expected output: 1
- The first antenna covers `[3, 7]`.
- The second antenna covers `[6, 10]`.
- To cover the entire range `[1, 10]`, we only need to extend the first antenna by 1 unit to cover position 1.

However, the provided program will output a higher cost because it incorrectly calculates the extension cost.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve properly calculating the minimum cost to extend the coverage of each antenna to cover all positions from 1 to m. This typically involves a more sophisticated DP or greedy algorithm that correctly handles the extension costs.

Given this counterexample, the program is incorrect.
