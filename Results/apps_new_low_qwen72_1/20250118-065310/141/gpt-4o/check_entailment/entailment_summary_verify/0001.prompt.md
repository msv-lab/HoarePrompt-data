You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the $(Ox)$ axis.

On this street, there are $n$ antennas, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th antenna lies on the position $x_i$ and has an initial scope of $s_i$: it covers all integer positions inside the interval $[x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i]$.

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by $1$, this operation costs $1$ coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside $[1; m]$, even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 80$ and $n \le m \le 100\ 000$).

The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $s_i$ ($1 \le x_i \le m$ and $0 \le s_i \le m$).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values $x_i$ are pairwise distinct).


-----Output-----

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

-----Note-----

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  Increase the scope of the first antenna by $40$, so that it becomes $2 + 40 = 42$. This antenna will cover interval $[43 - 42; 43 + 42]$ which is $[1; 85]$  Increase the scope of the second antenna by $210$, so that it becomes $4 + 210 = 214$. This antenna will cover interval $[300 - 214; 300 + 214]$, which is $[86; 514]$  Increase the scope of the third antenna by $31$, so that it becomes $10 + 31 = 41$. This antenna will cover interval $[554 - 41; 554 + 41]$, which is $[513; 595]$ 

Total cost is $40 + 210 + 31 = 281$. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from $1$ to $595$ covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions $513$ and $514$ are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval $[0; 2]$ so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position $1$; positions $0$ and $2$ are covered, but it's not important.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
antennas = []
for i in range(n):
    x = int(data[2 + 2 * i])
    s = int(data[2 + 2 * i + 1])
    antennas.append((x, s))
print(func_1(n, m, antennas))

def func_1(n, m, antennas):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    antennas.sort()
    for (x, s) in antennas:
        left = max(0, x - s)
        right = min(m, x + s)
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])
        for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))
    return dp[m] if dp[m] != float('inf') else -1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `antennas`. It aims to determine the minimum cost to cover the range from 0 to `m` using the signal ranges of the given antennas. Each antenna is represented by a tuple `(x_i, s_i)`, where `x_i` is the position and `s_i` is the signal strength. The function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to infinity, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0. It then sorts the `antennas` list based on their positions. For each antenna `(x, s)` in the sorted list, the function updates the `dp` array to reflect the minimum cost to cover the range `[left, right]` where `left = max(0, x - s)` and `right = min(m, x + s)`. Additionally, it updates the `dp` array for positions beyond `right` to account for the cost of extending coverage. Finally, the function returns `dp[m]` if it is not infinity, indicating the minimum cost to cover the entire range up to `m`; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to cover the range with the given antennas. Edge cases include scenarios where no antenna can cover the entire range, or where the range `m` is less than the position of any antenna, leading to the function returning -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem using dynamic programming (DP). Here’s a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the entire input and splits it into a list `data`. It then extracts the number of antennas `n` and the length of the street `m`. It also parses the positions and scopes of the antennas and stores them in a list `antennas`.

2. **Initialization**: A DP array `dp` of size `m + 1` is initialized with `float('inf')` to represent the minimum cost to cover up to each position on the street. The base case `dp[0]` is set to 0 because no cost is needed to cover position 0.

3. **Sorting Antennas**: The antennas are sorted based on their positions. This helps in processing the antennas in a sequential manner.

4. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - For each antenna `(x, s)`, the program calculates the range `[left, right]` that the antenna currently covers.
   - It updates the DP array for the positions within this range to ensure that the minimum cost to cover these positions is updated correctly.
   - It then extends the coverage beyond the current range by considering the cost of increasing the scope of the antenna to cover additional positions.

5. **Final Result**: The program returns the value of `dp[m]`, which represents the minimum cost to cover the entire street from position 1 to position `m`.

However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

- **Incorrect DP Update for Extended Coverage**: The line `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))` seems incorrect. The logic for extending the coverage should be more carefully handled. Specifically, the term `j - 2 * x` does not correctly represent the cost to extend the coverage.

- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program should handle cases where the initial coverage of an antenna already covers the entire required range without needing any additional cost.

Given these issues, the program as written does not correctly compute the minimum cost to cover the entire street.
