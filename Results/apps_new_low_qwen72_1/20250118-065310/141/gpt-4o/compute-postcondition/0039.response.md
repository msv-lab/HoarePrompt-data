The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `left`, and `right`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `left`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), and `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `right`.

Given that `j` was `left` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration:
- `j` will be `left + 1`
- `left` remains \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` remains \( \min(m, x + s) \)

Since `j` must be less than or equal to `right` for the loop to continue, `left + 1` must be less than or equal to `right`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `left + 1`, `dp[left]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`**
