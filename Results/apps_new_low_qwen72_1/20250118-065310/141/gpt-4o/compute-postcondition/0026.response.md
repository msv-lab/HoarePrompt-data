To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
- `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.
- `j` is `right + 3`.
- `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`.
- `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`.
- `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`.
- For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`.

### Loop Condition:
```
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `right + 1` to `m + 1`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `right + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`.

### Conditions:
1. `right + 1 <= m`
2. `right < m` (already given)

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `right + 1 <= m`
- `right < m` (which implies `right + 1 <= m` since `right` is an integer)

Given that `right < m` is already part of the initial state, the loop will execute as long as `right + 1` is within the bounds of the range.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`, and `right + 1 <= m`**.
