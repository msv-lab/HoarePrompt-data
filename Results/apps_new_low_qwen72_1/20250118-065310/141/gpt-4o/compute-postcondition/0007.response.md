To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the state and the loop head:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
- `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = float('inf')` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \).
- `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `j` is `left`.
- `left <= right`.
- `dp[left] = min(dp[left], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`.

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[left, right]`.
2. **Initial State of `j`**: At the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to `left`.
3. **Increment of `j`**: In each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j`**: After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `left + 1`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `antennas` remains the same.
- `dp` remains the same.
- `(x, s)` remains the same.
- `left` remains the same.
- `right` remains the same.
- `j` is `left + 1`.
- `left <= right` remains true.
- `dp[left] = min(dp[left], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` remains true.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = float('inf')` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `j` is `left + 1`, `left <= right`, and `dp[left] = min(dp[left], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`**
