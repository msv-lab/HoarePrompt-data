You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: The provided code snippet updates the `dp` list by setting `dp[j]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)` for a given index `j`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial Values:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
   - `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
   - `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
   - `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`.
   - `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`.
   - `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
   - `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
   - `left <= right`.
   - `right < m`.

2. **Impact of the Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` for a specific index `j` using the formula `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`.
   - This means that for the given `j`, `dp[j]` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the value calculated from the expression `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)`.

3. **Calculate the New Value of `dp[j]`:**
   - Let's denote the current value of `dp[j]` as `current_dp_j`.
   - The new value of `dp[j]` will be `min(current_dp_j, dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - The only variable that changes is `dp[j]`.
   - All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`, `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`.**
```
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
