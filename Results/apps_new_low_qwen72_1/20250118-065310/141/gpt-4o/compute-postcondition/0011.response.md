The provided code snippet updates the `dp` list by setting `dp[j]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)` for a given index `j`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial Values:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
   - `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
   - `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
   - `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`.
   - `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`.
   - `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
   - `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
   - `left <= right`.
   - `right < m`.

2. **Impact of the Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` for a specific index `j` using the formula `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`.
   - This means that for the given `j`, `dp[j]` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the value calculated from the expression `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)`.

3. **Calculate the New Value of `dp[j]`:**
   - Let's denote the current value of `dp[j]` as `current_dp_j`.
   - The new value of `dp[j]` will be `min(current_dp_j, dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - The only variable that changes is `dp[j]`.
   - All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`, `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`.**
