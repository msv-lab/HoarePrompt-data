To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \)
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\)
- `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \)
- `left <= right`
- `right < m`
- `right + 1 <= m`
- `j` is `right + 2`
- `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`
- `m` must be such that `right + 2 <= m`

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is in the range from `right + 1` to `m` (inclusive).
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: At the start of the first iteration, `j` is initialized to `right + 2`.
3. **Next Iteration**: After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `right + 3`.
4. **Range Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be within the range `right + 1` to `m` (inclusive). This means `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is `right + 3`
- `m` must be such that `right + 3 <= m`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `right + 1 <= m`, `j` is `right + 3`, `m` must be such that `right + 3 <= m`**
