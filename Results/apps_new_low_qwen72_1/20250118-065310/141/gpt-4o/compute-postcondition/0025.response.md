To determine the final output state after the loop completes its execution, we need to analyze the given loop and initial state, track variable changes, summarize the loop behavior, and verify the relationships.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**:
  - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
  - \( m \) is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
  - `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
  - \((x, s)\) is the second tuple in `antennas`.
  - `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
  - `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
  - `left <= right`.
  - `right < m`.
  - `j` is `right + 3`.
  - `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`.
  - `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`.
  - `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`.

#### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `n`, `m`, `antennas`, `x`, `s`, `left`, `right` remain constant throughout the loop.
- **Variables Updated in the Loop**:
  - `dp[j]` is updated for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`.

#### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop iterates over the range `[left, right + 1]`.
- For each `j` in this range, `dp[j]` is set to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.

#### 4. Verify Relationships
- The loop updates `dp[j]` for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`.
- After the loop, `dp[j]` for each `j` in this range will be the minimum of its initial value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.

### Final Output State
After the loop has completed its execution, the final state of the variables will be as follows:

- **Constant Variables**:
  - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
  - `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
  - `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
  - \((x, s)\) is the second tuple in `antennas`.
  - `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
  - `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
  - `left <= right`.
  - `right < m`.
  - `j` is `right + 3`.
  - `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`.
  - `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`.
  - `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`.

- **Updated Variables**:
  - For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`.**
