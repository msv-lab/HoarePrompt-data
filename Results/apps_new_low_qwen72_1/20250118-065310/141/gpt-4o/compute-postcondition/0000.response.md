The provided code initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with a length of `m + 1`, setting all elements to infinity (`float('inf')`). It then sets the first element of `dp` to 0. Finally, it sorts the list `antennas`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100,000.
- `antennas` is a list of `n` tuples `(x_i, s_i)`, where each `x_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ `m` and each `s_i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s_i` ≤ `m`, and all `x_i` values are unique.

After executing the code:
- `dp` is now a list of length `m + 1`, where all elements except the first are set to infinity (`float('inf')`), and the first element is 0.
- `antennas` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple.

Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100,000. antennas is a sorted list of n tuples (x_i, s_i), where each x_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and each s_i is an integer such that 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m, and all x_i values are unique. dp is a list of length m + 1 with dp[0] = 0 and dp[i] = float('inf') for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.**
