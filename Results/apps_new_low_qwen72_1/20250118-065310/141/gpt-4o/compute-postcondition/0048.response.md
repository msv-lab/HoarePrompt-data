Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `dp[j]` for each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`. The loop executes if and only if `right + 1 <= m`. If `right + 1 > m`, the loop does not execute. Variables `n`, `m`, `antennas`, `x`, `s`, `left`, and `right` remain constant throughout the loop.**
