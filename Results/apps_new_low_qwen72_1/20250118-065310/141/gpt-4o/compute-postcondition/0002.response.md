The provided code snippet calculates the range `[left, right]` based on the first tuple `(x, s)` in the `antennas` list. Here's the analysis and the final output state:

- The variable `left` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and `x - s`. This ensures that `left` does not go below 0.
- The variable `right` is calculated as the minimum value between `m` and `x + s`. This ensures that `right` does not exceed `m`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \) and \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), and all \( x_i \) values are unique.
- `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = float('inf')` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \).
- `antennas` must have at least one tuple, and `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`.

Let's assume the first tuple in `antennas` is `(x, s)`.

After executing the code:
- `left` is set to `max(0, x - s)`.
- `right` is set to `min(m, x + s)`.

The final state includes the updated values of `left` and `right`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), m is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), antennas is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), dp is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with dp[0] = 0 and dp[i] = float('inf') for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \), (x, s) is the first tuple in antennas, left is \( \max(0, x - s) \), right is \( \min(m, x + s) \)**.
