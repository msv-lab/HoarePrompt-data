Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`, `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), and `left <= right`. The loop updates the `dp` array for indices between `left` and `right` inclusive, setting `dp[j]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`. Variables `n`, `m`, `antennas`, `x`, `s`, `left`, and `right` remain constant throughout the loop.**
