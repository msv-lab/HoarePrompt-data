Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \). The `dp` array has been updated such that for each antenna \((x, s)\) in `antennas`, the range `[left, right]` is defined as \(\max(0, x - s)\) to \(\min(m, x + s)\). For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`. For each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`. The loop iterates through all `n` antennas, and the `dp` array reflects the minimum values based on the signal ranges of all antennas. The loop will not execute further once all `n` antennas have been processed.**

- **Constant Variables**: `n`, `m`, `antennas`.
- **Final Values**: `dp` array is fully updated according to the rules specified in the loop.
- **Conditions for Execution**: The loop executes for each of the `n` antennas in the `antennas` list. The loop will not execute further once all antennas have been processed.
