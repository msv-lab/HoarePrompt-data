You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100,000. antennas is a list of n tuples (x_i, s_i), where each x_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and each s_i is an integer such that 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m, and all x_i values are unique.
def func_1(n, m, antennas):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (m + 1)

dp[0] = 0

antennas.sort()
    for (x, s) in antennas:
        left = max(0, x - s)
        
        right = min(m, x + s)
        
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])
        
        for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \). The `dp` array has been updated such that for each antenna \((x, s)\) in `antennas`, the range `[left, right]` is defined as \(\max(0, x - s)\) to \(\min(m, x + s)\). For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`. For each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`. The loop iterates through all `n` antennas, and the `dp` array reflects the minimum values based on the signal ranges of all antennas. The loop will not execute further once all `n` antennas have been processed.
    return dp[m] if dp[m] != float('inf') else -1
    #The program returns `dp[m]` if `dp[m]` is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1. Here, `dp[m]` represents the minimum cost calculated for covering the entire range up to `m` using the signal ranges of the antennas, based on the updates made during the iteration over all `n` antennas.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `antennas`. It returns `dp[m]` if `dp[m]` is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1. `dp[m]` represents the minimum cost for covering the range up to `m` using the signal ranges of the antennas.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `dp[m]` if `dp[m]` is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1. Here, `dp[m]` represents the minimum cost calculated for covering the entire range up to `m` using the signal ranges of the antennas, based on the updates made during the iteration over all `n` antennas.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
