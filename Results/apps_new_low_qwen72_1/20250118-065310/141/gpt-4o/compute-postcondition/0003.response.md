To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `range(left, right + 1)` will generate a sequence of values for `j`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `left`: This is calculated as `max(0, x - s)`.
   - `right`: This is calculated as `min(m, x + s)`.
   - `j`: This is the loop variable that will iterate from `left` to `right` inclusive.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The `range(left, right + 1)` will generate a sequence of values for `j` if `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
   - If `left > right`, the `range` function will produce an empty sequence, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
   - `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
   - `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
   - `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = float('inf')` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \).
   - `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`.
   - `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
   - `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
   - Since `left = max(0, x - s)` and `right = min(m, x + s)`, the condition `left <= right` must hold true.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must be true:
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
- Given the definitions of `left` and `right`, this means \( \max(0, x - s) \leq \min(m, x + s) \).

Since `x` and `s` are derived from the first tuple in `antennas`, and given the constraints on `x` and `s`, the condition \( \max(0, x - s) \leq \min(m, x + s) \) will always hold true because:
- \( x - s \) is non-negative (since \( x \geq 1 \) and \( s \geq 0 \)).
- \( x + s \) is at most `m` (since \( x \leq m \) and \( s \leq m \)).

Therefore, the loop will execute if the initial state is correctly set up.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = float('inf')` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), and `left <= right`**.
