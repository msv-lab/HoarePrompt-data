The provided code snippet reassigns the values of `left` and `right` based on the conditions given in the initial state. Here's the analysis and the final output state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \)
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \)
- `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \)
- `left <= right`
- `right < m`
- `j` is `right + 3`
- `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`
- `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`
- `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`
- For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`
- For each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`

### Code Snippet:
```python
left = max(0, x - s)
right = min(m, x + s)
```

### Analysis:
- The first line `left = max(0, x - s)` recalculates `left` as the maximum of 0 and \( x - s \). This ensures that `left` is non-negative.
- The second line `right = min(m, x + s)` recalculates `right` as the minimum of `m` and \( x + s \). This ensures that `right` does not exceed `m`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \)
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \)
- `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \)
- `left <= right`
- `right < m`
- `j` is `right + 3`
- `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`
- `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`
- `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`
- For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`
- For each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`

Output State: **n is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), m is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), antennas is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), (x, s) is the third tuple in antennas, left is \( \max(0, x - s) \), right is \( \min(m, x + s) \), left <= right, right < m, j is right + 3, dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1), dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2), dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3), for each j in the range [left, right + 1], dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)]), for each j in the range [right + 1, m], dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))**
