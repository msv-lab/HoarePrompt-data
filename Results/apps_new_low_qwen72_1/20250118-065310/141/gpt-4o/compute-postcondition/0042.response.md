To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop can start.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range from `right + 1` to `m` (inclusive). This means the loop will execute if `right + 1` is less than or equal to `m`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
   - `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
   - `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\).
   - `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`.
   - `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
   - `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
   - `left <= right`.
   - `right < m`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- For the loop to execute, the starting value of `j` (which is `right + 1`) must be less than or equal to the ending value `m`.
- Therefore, the condition `right + 1 <= m` must hold true.

Given the initial conditions:
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- Since `right < m`, it follows that `right + 1 <= m`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `right + 1 <= m`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, and `right + 1 <= m`.**
