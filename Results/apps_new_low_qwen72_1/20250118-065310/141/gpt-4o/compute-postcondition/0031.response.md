The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` using the formula `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `dp[j]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)`.
- The value of `j` is `right + 5`.
- The value of `x` comes from the second tuple in the `antennas` list.
- The value of `right` is `min(m, x + s)`, where `s` is also from the second tuple in `antennas`.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `dp[j]` at index `j` which is `right + 5`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 5`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`, `right + 1 <= m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`, `right + 5 <= m`**.
