The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.

- `dp[j]` is updated based on the value of `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.
- `j` is `right + 3`.
- `left` is `max(0, x - s)`.
- `right` is `min(m, x + s)`.
- Since `left <= right` and `right < m`, `j` will always be a valid index within the bounds of `dp`.

The impact of the code is:
- `dp[j]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.

The output state includes:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\).
- `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.
- `j` is `right + 3`.
- `dp[j]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`, `dp[j]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`**.
