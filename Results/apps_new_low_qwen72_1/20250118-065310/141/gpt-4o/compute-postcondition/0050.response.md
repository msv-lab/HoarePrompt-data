Output State: **The program returns `dp[m]` if `dp[m]` is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1. Here, `dp[m]` represents the minimum cost calculated for covering the entire range up to `m` using the signal ranges of the antennas, based on the updates made during the iteration over all `n` antennas.**
