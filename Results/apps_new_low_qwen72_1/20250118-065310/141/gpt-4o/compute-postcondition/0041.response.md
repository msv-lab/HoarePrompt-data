Output State: **n is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), m is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), antennas is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), (x, s) is the third tuple in antennas, left is \( \max(0, x - s) \), right is \( \min(m, x + s) \), left <= right, right < m, dp[j] for each j in the range [left, right + 1] is the minimum of its current value and dp[max(0, left - 1)], dp[right + 1] is the minimum of its current value and dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1, dp[right + 2] is the minimum of its current value and dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2, dp[right + 3] is the minimum of its current value and dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3, for each j in the range [right + 1, m], dp[j] is the minimum of its current value and dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right).**
