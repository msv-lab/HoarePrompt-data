The code updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking the minimum between its current value and the value of `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.

- `dp[j]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `antennas`, `(x, s)`, `left`, `right`, `j`, `dp[right + 1]`, `dp[right + 2]`, `dp[right + 3]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `left`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`**
