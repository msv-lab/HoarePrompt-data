To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step by step:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \)
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\)
- `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \)
- `left <= right`
- `right < m`
- `j` is `right + 3`
- `dp[j]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `j`, `left`, and `right`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[left, right + 1)`.
3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is `right + 3`
   - This means the last iteration of the loop set `j` to `right + 3`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be reset to `left`.
- `left` and `right` remain the same because they are determined by the fixed values of `x` and `s` from the third tuple in `antennas`.

### Updated State:
- `j` should be reset to `left` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `left`, `dp[j]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`**
