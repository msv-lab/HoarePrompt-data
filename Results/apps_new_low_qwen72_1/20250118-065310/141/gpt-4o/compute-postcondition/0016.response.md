### Analysis of the Loop and State After 3 Executions

#### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
- `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`.
- `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.

#### Loop Execution:
The loop updates the `dp` list for indices `j` from `right + 1` to `m` inclusive, using the formula:
```python
dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis for 3 Executions:
1. **First Execution:**
   - `j` starts at `right + 1`.
   - `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, (right + 1) - 2 * x)] + (right + 1 - right))`
   - Simplifies to: `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`

2. **Second Execution:**
   - `j` is now `right + 2`.
   - `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, (right + 2) - 2 * x)] + (right + 2 - right))`
   - Simplifies to: `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`

3. **Third Execution:**
   - `j` is now `right + 3`.
   - `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, (right + 3) - 2 * x)] + (right + 3 - right))`
   - Simplifies to: `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`

#### Final State:
- `n` remains an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` remains an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` remains a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
- `dp` remains a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`.
- `(x, s)` remains the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` remains \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` remains \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.
- `j` is now `right + 3`.
- `dp[right + 1]` is updated to `min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`.
- `dp[right + 2]` is updated to `min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`.
- `dp[right + 3]` is updated to `min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`.

### Output State:
**`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`, `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`, and `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`.**
