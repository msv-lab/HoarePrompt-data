Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `antennas`. It aims to determine the minimum cost to cover the range from 0 to `m` using the signal ranges of the given antennas. Each antenna is represented by a tuple `(x_i, s_i)`, where `x_i` is the position and `s_i` is the signal strength. The function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to infinity, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0. It then sorts the `antennas` list based on their positions. For each antenna `(x, s)` in the sorted list, the function updates the `dp` array to reflect the minimum cost to cover the range `[left, right]` where `left = max(0, x - s)` and `right = min(m, x + s)`. Additionally, it updates the `dp` array for positions beyond `right` to account for the cost of extending coverage. Finally, the function returns `dp[m]` if it is not infinity, indicating the minimum cost to cover the entire range up to `m`; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to cover the range with the given antennas. Edge cases include scenarios where no antenna can cover the entire range, or where the range `m` is less than the position of any antenna, leading to the function returning -1. **
