To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- **n and m are integers**: \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \) and \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- **antennas**: A sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), where:
  - Each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \).
  - Each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
  - All \( x_i \) values are unique.
- **dp**: A list of length \( m + 1 \) with:
  - \( dp[0] = 0 \)
  - \( dp[i] = \text{float('inf')} \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, s) in antennas:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the list `antennas`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, the list `antennas` must contain at least one tuple.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. **antennas must be non-empty**: Since `antennas` is a list of tuples and the loop iterates over this list, the list must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
2. **(x, s) must be the first tuple in the list**: When the loop starts, the first iteration will use the first tuple in the list `antennas`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `antennas` must be a non-empty list.
- The first tuple in `antennas` is \((x, s)\).

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges.
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples with the specified properties.
- `dp` is initialized as described.

The state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop will execute the first time, is:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \) and \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), and all \( x_i \) values are unique, `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = float('inf')` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \), `antennas` must have at least one tuple, and `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`.**
