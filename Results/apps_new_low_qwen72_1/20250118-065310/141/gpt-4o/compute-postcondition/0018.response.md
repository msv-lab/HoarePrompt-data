The provided code snippet is a repetition of the initialization of `left` and `right`, which were already defined in the initial state. Therefore, these lines do not change the state of the program. The values of `left` and `right` remain as they were initially defined.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \)
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \)
- `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \)
- `left <= right`
- `right < m`
- `j` is `right + 3`
- `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`
- `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`
- `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`

Since the code snippet does not introduce any new operations or changes to the existing variables, the final state remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), m is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), antennas is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), (x, s) is the second tuple in antennas, left is \( \max(0, x - s) \), right is \( \min(m, x + s) \), left <= right, right < m, j is right + 3, dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1), dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2), dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)**
