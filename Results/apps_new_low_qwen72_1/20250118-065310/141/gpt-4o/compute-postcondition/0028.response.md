To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
```

This means the loop iterates over the range from `right + 1` to `m` inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. **`j` must be within the range `[right + 1, m]`**: The variable `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

2. **`right + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`**: This ensures that the range `[right + 1, m]` is valid and non-empty.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `right + 3`.
- `right + 1 <= m`.

Let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

1. **Increment `j` by 1**: Since `j` is `right + 3` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `right + 4` at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Ensure `j` is still within the range `[right + 1, m]`**: For the loop to continue, `right + 4` must be less than or equal to `m`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 4`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`, `right + 1 <= m`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`, `right + 4 <= m`**.
