To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions that control the loop's execution. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be true:

1. **`right + 1` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`**: This ensures that the range `range(right + 1, m + 1)` is not empty and contains at least one element. If `right + 1` is greater than `m + 1`, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \)
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \)
- `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`
- `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \)
- `left <= right`

We need to ensure that `right + 1` is less than or equal to `m + 1` for the loop to execute. This can be broken down as follows:

- `right + 1 <= m + 1`
- `right <= m`

Since `right` is defined as `min(m, x + s)`, it is always true that `right <= m`. Therefore, the condition `right + 1 <= m + 1` is always satisfied.

However, for the loop to actually execute, `right + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`, which means `right` must be less than `m`.

Given the initial state, the loop will execute if `right < m`.

Thus, the state must be:
- `right` must be less than `m`
- `j` starts from `right + 1` and goes up to `m`

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`, `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, and `right < m`**
