The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `right`, and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `m`. The loop iterates from `right + 1` to `m + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is `right + 1`
- `m` is such that `n <= m <= 100,000`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `right + 2`.
- `m` must still satisfy the condition `n <= m <= 100,000`.

Since `right < m` and `right + 1 <= m`, the next value of `j` (`right + 2`) must be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `right + 1 <= m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)), `j` is `right + 2`, `m` must be such that `right + 2 <= m`**
