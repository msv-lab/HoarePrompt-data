To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will start its first iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `left` to `right + 1`.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(left, right + 1)` must contain at least one element.
   - This means that `left` must be less than or equal to `right + 1`.

3. **Given State**:
   - `left` is defined as `max(0, x - s)`.
   - `right` is defined as `min(m, x + s)`.
   - We know that `left <= right` and `right < m`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - Since `left <= right`, the range `range(left, right + 1)` will always contain at least one element (from `left` to `right` inclusive).
   - Therefore, the loop will execute at least once as long as `left` and `right` are valid and satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
- `right` must be less than `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\).
- `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`**.
