To determine the updated state after executing the given Python code snippet, we need to follow the steps carefully:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
- `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`.
- `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.
- `j` is `right + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `dp[j]` is being updated.
   - `j` is `right + 2`.
   - `dp[j]` is compared with `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)`.

2. **Calculate the New Value of `dp[j]`:**
   - `j` is `right + 2`.
   - `max(0, j - 2 * x)` is calculated as `max(0, (right + 2) - 2 * x)`.
   - `dp[max(0, (right + 2) - 2 * x)]` is the value at the index `max(0, (right + 2) - 2 * x)` in the `dp` list.
   - `(j - right)` is `((right + 2) - right)`, which simplifies to `2`.

3. **Update `dp[j]`:**
   - The new value of `dp[j]` is the minimum of the current `dp[j]` and `dp[max(0, (right + 2) - 2 * x)] + 2`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` remains an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` remains a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
- `dp` remains a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`.
- `(x, s)` remains the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` remains \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` remains \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.
- `j` remains `right + 2`.
- `dp[right + 2]` is updated to `min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, (right + 2) - 2 * x)] + 2)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
**`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \) with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, left - 1)])` for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \) where `i` is within the range `[left, right]`, `(x, s)` is the first tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 2`, and `dp[right + 2]` is `min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, (right + 2) - 2 * x)] + 2)`.**
