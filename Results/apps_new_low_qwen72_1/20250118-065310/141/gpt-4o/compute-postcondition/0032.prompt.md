Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):
    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: The provided code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` using the formula `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program step by step:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
   - `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
   - `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
   - `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`.
   - `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
   - `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
   - `left <= right`.
   - `right < m`.
   - `j` is `right + 3`.
   - `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`.
   - `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`.
   - `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`.
   - For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`.
   - `right + 1 <= m`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))` updates the value of `dp[j]` for the current value of `j`.
   - This update is based on the minimum of the current value of `dp[j]` and the value `dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right)`.

3. **Updated State**:
   - The value of `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`.
   - All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`, `right + 1 <= m`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`**.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 5`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`, `right + 1 <= m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`, `right + 5 <= m`


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
