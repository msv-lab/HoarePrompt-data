The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `antennas`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80.
- `m` is an integer such that n ≤ m ≤ 100,000.
- `antennas` is a list of `n` tuples `(x_i, s_i)`, where each `x_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ m, each `s_i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m, and all `x_i` values are unique.

The function returns `dp[m]` if `dp[m]` is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1. Here, `dp[m]` represents the minimum cost calculated for covering the entire range up to `m` using the signal ranges of the antennas, based on the updates made during the iteration over all `n` antennas.
