The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j`, `left`, and `right`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `left` and `right`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `right`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is `left`.
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1.
- `j` must be less than or equal to `right`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `left + 1`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`**
