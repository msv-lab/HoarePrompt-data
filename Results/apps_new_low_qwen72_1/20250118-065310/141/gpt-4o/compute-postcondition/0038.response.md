The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` by setting it to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \)
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\)
- `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \)
- `left <= right`
- `right < m`
- `j` is `left`
- `dp[j]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `dp[j]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.

Since `j` is `left`, and `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), the value of `dp[left]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `left`, `dp[left]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, left - 1)]`**
