To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will start iterating.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \).
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \).
- `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`.
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.
- `right < m`.
- `j` is `right + 3`.
- `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`.
- `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`.
- `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`**: The loop iterates over the range from `left` to `right + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must be non-empty, i.e., `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `left` is defined as \( \max(0, x - s) \).
   - `right` is defined as \( \min(m, x + s) \).
   - We know that `left <= right` and `right < m`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
   - Since `left` and `right` are already defined and we know `left <= right`, the loop will execute as long as these conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute if the following conditions are met:
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \).
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \).
- `left <= right`.

Since these conditions are already given in the initial state, the loop will execute as long as the initial state holds true.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)**.
