To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for (x, s) in antennas:
```

This loop iterates over the elements of the list `antennas`, where each element is a tuple `(x, s)`. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list `antennas`.

### Current State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \)
- `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \)
- `(x, s)` is the second tuple in `antennas`
- `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \)
- `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \)
- `left <= right`
- `right < m`
- `j` is `right + 3`
- `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`
- `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`
- `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`
- For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`
- For each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `s`, which are the elements of the current tuple being iterated over in `antennas`.
- After the current iteration, the next tuple in `antennas` will be used for the next iteration.

### New State:
- The next tuple in `antennas` will be `(x, s)`, where `x` and `s` are the values of the third tuple in `antennas`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `left`, `right`, `j`, and `dp`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \), `(x, s)` is the third tuple in `antennas`, `left` is \( \max(0, x - s) \), `right` is \( \min(m, x + s) \), `left <= right`, `right < m`, `j` is `right + 3`, `dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right + 1], dp[max(0, 1 - 2 * x)] + 1)`, `dp[right + 2] = min(dp[right + 2], dp[max(0, 2 - 2 * x)] + 2)`, `dp[right + 3] = min(dp[right + 3], dp[max(0, 3 - 2 * x)] + 3)`, for each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`, for each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]`, `dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`**.
