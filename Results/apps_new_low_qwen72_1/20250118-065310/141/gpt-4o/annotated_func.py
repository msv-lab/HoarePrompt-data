#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100,000. antennas is a list of n tuples (x_i, s_i), where each x_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and each s_i is an integer such that 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m, and all x_i values are unique.

    dp = [float('inf')] * (m + 1)

    for (x, s) in antennas:
        left = max(0, x - s)

        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])
        
        for j in range(right + 1, m + 1):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 80 \), `m` is an integer such that \( n \leq m \leq 100,000 \), `antennas` is a sorted list of \( n \) tuples \((x_i, s_i)\) where each \( x_i \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq x_i \leq m \) and each \( s_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s_i \leq m \). The `dp` array has been updated such that for each antenna \((x, s)\) in `antennas`, the range `[left, right]` is defined as \(\max(0, x - s)\) to \(\min(m, x + s)\). For each `j` in the range `[left, right + 1]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, left - 1)])`. For each `j` in the range `[right + 1, m]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `min(dp[j], dp[max(0, j - 2 * x)] + (j - right))`. The loop iterates through all `n` antennas, and the `dp` array reflects the minimum values based on the signal ranges of all antennas. The loop will not execute further once all `n` antennas have been processed.
    return dp[m] if dp[m] != float('inf') else -1
    #The program returns `dp[m]` if `dp[m]` is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1. Here, `dp[m]` represents the minimum cost calculated for covering the entire range up to `m` using the signal ranges of the antennas, based on the updates made during the iteration over all `n` antennas.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `antennas`. It aims to determine the minimum cost to cover the range from 0 to `m` using the signal ranges of the given antennas. Each antenna is represented by a tuple `(x_i, s_i)`, where `x_i` is the position and `s_i` is the signal strength. The function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to infinity, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0. It then sorts the `antennas` list based on their positions. For each antenna `(x, s)` in the sorted list, the function updates the `dp` array to reflect the minimum cost to cover the range `[left, right]` where `left = max(0, x - s)` and `right = min(m, x + s)`. Additionally, it updates the `dp` array for positions beyond `right` to account for the cost of extending coverage. Finally, the function returns `dp[m]` if it is not infinity, indicating the minimum cost to cover the entire range up to `m`; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to cover the range with the given antennas. Edge cases include scenarios where no antenna can cover the entire range, or where the range `m` is less than the position of any antenna, leading to the function returning -1.
