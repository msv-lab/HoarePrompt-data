The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80. Since the loop iterates `n` times, and we are at the start of the next iteration, `n` remains the same. However, the loop counter (represented by `_` in this case) is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the current iteration count must be less than `n`. Since the loop counter is not explicitly tracked in the state, we focus on the fact that the loop will continue as long as it hasn't reached `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80, `m` is an integer such that n ≤ m ≤ 100,000, `antennas` is a list containing one tuple (x, s) where x and s are integers provided by the input**
