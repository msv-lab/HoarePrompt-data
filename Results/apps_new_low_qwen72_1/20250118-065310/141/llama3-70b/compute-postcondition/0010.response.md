To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `for` loop can start its first iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(m, x - s - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range and Direction**:
   - The loop iterates from `m` down to `x - s - 1` with a step of `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value `m` must be greater than or equal to the ending value `x - s - 1`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\).
   - `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\).
   - `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers.
   - `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`.
   - `antennas` must have at least one tuple.
   - `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`.
   - `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `m >= x - s - 1`.
   - This ensures that the range from `m` to `x - s - 1` (inclusive) is non-empty.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `m` is given as an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\), and `x` and `s` are derived from the first tuple in `antennas`, we need to ensure that `m` is large enough to satisfy the condition `m >= x - s - 1`.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, the following conditions must hold true:
- `m` must be greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`.
- `antennas` must have at least one tuple.
- `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\), `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`, `antennas` must have at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`, and `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`**.
