The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the given formula. Here's the detailed step-by-step impact:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\)
   - `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\)
   - `antennas` is a sorted list of \(n + 1\) tuples
   - `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and for each index `i` in the range \([x - s, m]\), `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, and all other elements remain `float('inf')`
   - `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `antennas`
   - `s` is the second element of the second tuple in `antennas`
   - `i` is `m - 2`
   - `dp[m - 1]` is updated to `min(dp[m - 1], dp[max(0, m - 1 - x - s)] + (m - 1 - x + s))`

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code updates `dp[i]` using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = \min(dp[i], dp[\max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))
     \]
   - Given `i` is `m - 2`, the update is:
     \[
     dp[m - 2] = \min(dp[m - 2], dp[\max(0, m - 2 - x - s)] + (m - 2 - x + s))
     \]

3. **Calculations**:
   - `i` is `m - 2`
   - `max(0, i - x - s)` is `max(0, m - 2 - x - s)`
   - The new value of `dp[m - 2]` is:
     \[
     dp[m - 2] = \min(dp[m - 2], dp[\max(0, m - 2 - x - s)] + (m - 2 - x + s))
     \]

4. **Output State**:
   - All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
   - `dp[m - 2]` is updated to the calculated value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\), `antennas` is a sorted list of \(n + 1\) tuples, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and for each index `i` in the range \([x - s, m]\), `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, and all other elements remain `float('inf')`, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `antennas`, `s` is the second element of the second tuple in `antennas`, `i` is `m - 2`, `dp[m - 1]` is updated to `min(dp[m - 1], dp[max(0, m - 1 - x - s)] + (m - 1 - x + s))`, `dp[m - 2]` is updated to `min(dp[m - 2], dp[max(0, m - 2 - x - s)] + (m - 2 - x + s))`**
