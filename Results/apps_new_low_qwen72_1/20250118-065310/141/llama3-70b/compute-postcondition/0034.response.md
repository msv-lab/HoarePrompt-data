The code snippet `print(dp[m])` outputs the value stored at index `m` of the list `dp`. This value was previously updated through the dynamic programming loop described in the initial state. The variables `n`, `m`, and `antennas` remain unchanged. The `dp` array is modified during the loop, and `dp[m]` holds the minimum cost calculated for the position `m`.

Since the exact values of `dp[m]` depend on the specific values of `n`, `m`, and the contents of `antennas`, and these values are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, we know that `dp[m]` contains the minimum cost computed for the position `m` after the dynamic programming updates.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\), `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and for each index `i` in the range \([0, m]\), `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum value computed by the loop over all antennas, and `dp[m]` is printed.
