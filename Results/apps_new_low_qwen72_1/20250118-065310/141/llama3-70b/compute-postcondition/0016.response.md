Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\), `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and for each index `i` in the range \([x - s, m]\), `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, and all other elements remain `float('inf')`, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`, `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`.**
