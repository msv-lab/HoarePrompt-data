The provided code initializes the variables `n` and `m` based on user input and creates an empty list named `antennas`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers within certain ranges and that there are `n` lines of input to follow, the code does not change these conditions. However, it prepares the environment for further processing by defining the list `antennas`.

Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100,000, antennas is an empty list**
