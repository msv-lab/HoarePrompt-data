The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `n`. The loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80, and the loop has just completed an iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` is incremented implicitly by the `range` function, but this is not visible in the state. The key condition is that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed the current iteration. Since the loop is about to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 0, but it will decrement by 1 as the loop progresses.

However, since the loop is defined by `range(n)`, the actual state that matters is that `n` remains unchanged because the loop's total number of iterations is determined at the start. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop has not yet completed its total number of iterations.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80, m is an integer such that n ≤ m ≤ 100,000, antennas is a list containing two tuples (x1, s1) and (x2, s2) where x1, s1, x2, and s2 are integers provided by the input**
