The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 1. The other variables, such as `m` and `antennas`, do not affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80, `m` is an integer such that n ≤ m ≤ 100,000, `antennas` is an empty list**
