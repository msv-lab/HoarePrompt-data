The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to the variables `x` and `s`, and then appends the tuple `(x, s)` to the list `antennas`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80
- `m` is an integer such that n ≤ m ≤ 100,000
- `antennas` is an empty list

After executing the code:
- The input values are split and converted to integers, and these values are assigned to `x` and `s`.
- The tuple `(x, s)` is appended to the list `antennas`.

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80, m is an integer such that n ≤ m ≤ 100,000, antennas is a list containing one tuple (x, s) where x and s are integers provided by the input**
