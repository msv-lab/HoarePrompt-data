The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, `x` and `s`, and appends them as a tuple to the list `antennas`.

- The initial state specifies that `antennas` contains one tuple `(x, s)` where `x` and `s` are integers provided by the input.
- The first line of the code reads two integers from the input and splits them, converting them to integers and assigning them to `x` and `s`.
- The second line appends the tuple `(x, s)` to the list `antennas`.

Since the initial state already contains a tuple `(x, s)` in `antennas`, and the code appends another tuple `(x, s)` to the same list, the list `antennas` will now contain two tuples.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80, m is an integer such that n ≤ m ≤ 100,000, antennas is a list containing two tuples (x1, s1) and (x2, s2) where x1, s1, x2, and s2 are integers provided by the input**
