The provided code snippet reads a space-separated pair of integers from the input, converts them to integers, and appends them as a tuple to the `antennas` list. Given the initial state, `antennas` already contains two tuples. After executing the code, a third tuple will be added to the `antennas` list, containing the new values of `x` and `s`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `s` depend on the input, we can only describe their properties based on the constraints given in the initial state. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80, m is an integer such that n ≤ m ≤ 100,000, antennas is a list containing three tuples (x1, s1), (x2, s2), and (x, s) where x1, s1, x2, s2, x, and s are integers provided by the input**
