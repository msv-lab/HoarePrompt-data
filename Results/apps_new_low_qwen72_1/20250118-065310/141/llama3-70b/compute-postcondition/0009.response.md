To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers.
- `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, s) in antennas:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `x` and `s`, which are elements of the tuples in the `antennas` list.
2. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute the first time, the `antennas` list must contain at least one tuple. This is because the loop iterates over the elements of the `antennas` list.

### Required State:
- The `antennas` list must have at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
- Since `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples and \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), the list is guaranteed to have at least one tuple.
- The first tuple in the `antennas` list will be unpacked into `x` and `s`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\), `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`, and `antennas` must have at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`, and `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`**.
