To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(m, x - s - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers.
- `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, and all other elements remain `float('inf')`.
- `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `m` down to `x - s - 1` with a step of `-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
- Since `i` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\), `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, and all other elements remain `float('inf')`, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`, `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`, `i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`**.
