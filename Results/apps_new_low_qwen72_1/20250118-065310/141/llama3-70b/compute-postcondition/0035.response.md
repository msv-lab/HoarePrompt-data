The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters within its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function internally processes data structured according to these constraints: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100,000. Following the definition of `n` and `m`, there are `n` lines of data, each containing two integers `x_i` and `s_i` where 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ m and 0 ≤ `s_i` ≤ m, and all `x_i` are distinct.

Since the output description is not provided, I cannot specify the exact return value. However, typically such a function would process the given data and return a result based on the internal logic. For the purpose of this task, I will assume the function processes the data and returns a computed value or a collection of values based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of data defined by integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100,000), and `n` pairs of integers `(x_i, s_i)` (where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m, and all x_i are distinct). The function returns a value or collection of values based on the processing of this data.**
