To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the current state:

```python
for i in range(m, x - s - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Current State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\).
- `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers.
- `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, and all other elements are `float('inf')`.
- `antennas` must have at least one tuple.
- `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`.
- `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `m` down to `x - s - 1` in steps of -1.
- The loop condition is that `i` must be greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value within the range `[x - s - 1, m]`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

### New State:
- `i` is decremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\), `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, and all other elements are `float('inf')`, `antennas` must have at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `antennas`, `s` is the second element of the first tuple in `antennas`, `i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`**
