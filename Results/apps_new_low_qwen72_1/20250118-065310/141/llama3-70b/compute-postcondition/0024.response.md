Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\) and \(m \geq x - s - 1\), `antennas` is a sorted list of \(n + 1\) tuples, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and for each index `i` in the range \([x - s, m]\), `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, and all other elements remain `float('inf')`, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `antennas`, `s` is the second element of the second tuple in `antennas`, `i` is `x - s - 1`. The loop iterates from `m` down to `x - s - 1`, updating `dp[i]` accordingly.**

Explanation:
- **Invariants**: `n`, `m`, `antennas`, `x`, and `s` remain constant throughout the loop.
- **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates from `m` down to `x - s - 1`, updating the `dp` array. For each `i` in this range, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s)`.
- **Final Values**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `x - s - 1`. The `dp` array will have been updated for all indices from `m` down to `x - s - 1` as described.
- **Conditions**: The loop will execute if `m` is greater than or equal to `x - s - 1`. If `m` is less than `x - s - 1`, the loop will not execute, and `dp` will remain unchanged except for `dp[0]` being 0.
