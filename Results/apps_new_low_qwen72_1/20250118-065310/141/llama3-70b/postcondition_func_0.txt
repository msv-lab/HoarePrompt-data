The function `func` reads input data consisting of integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 80\) and \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\)), followed by `n` pairs of integers \((x_i, s_i)\) (where \(1 \leq x_i \leq m\) and \(0 \leq s_i \leq m\), and all \(x_i\) are distinct). It then processes this data to compute the minimum cost required to cover the entire range from 0 to \(m\) using the given antennas. The function sorts the list of antennas based on their positions \(x_i\) and uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost. Finally, it prints the minimum cost to cover the range up to \(m\). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. If the input does not meet the specified constraints, the behavior of the function is undefined.
