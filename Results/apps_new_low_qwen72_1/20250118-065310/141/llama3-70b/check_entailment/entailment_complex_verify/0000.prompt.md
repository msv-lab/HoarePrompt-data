You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the $(Ox)$ axis.

On this street, there are $n$ antennas, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th antenna lies on the position $x_i$ and has an initial scope of $s_i$: it covers all integer positions inside the interval $[x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i]$.

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by $1$, this operation costs $1$ coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside $[1; m]$, even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 80$ and $n \le m \le 100\ 000$).

The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $s_i$ ($1 \le x_i \le m$ and $0 \le s_i \le m$).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values $x_i$ are pairwise distinct).


-----Output-----

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from $1$ to $m$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

-----Note-----

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  Increase the scope of the first antenna by $40$, so that it becomes $2 + 40 = 42$. This antenna will cover interval $[43 - 42; 43 + 42]$ which is $[1; 85]$  Increase the scope of the second antenna by $210$, so that it becomes $4 + 210 = 214$. This antenna will cover interval $[300 - 214; 300 + 214]$, which is $[86; 514]$  Increase the scope of the third antenna by $31$, so that it becomes $10 + 31 = 41$. This antenna will cover interval $[554 - 41; 554 + 41]$, which is $[513; 595]$ 

Total cost is $40 + 210 + 31 = 281$. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from $1$ to $595$ covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions $513$ and $514$ are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval $[0; 2]$ so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position $1$; positions $0$ and $2$ are covered, but it's not important.

    print(dp[m])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100,000. There are n lines following the first line, each containing two integers x_i and s_i where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m, and all x_i are distinct.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 80\), `m` is an integer such that \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\), `antennas` is a sorted list of `n` tuples \((x_1, s_1), (x_2, s_2), \ldots, (x_n, s_n)\) where \(x_1, s_1, x_2, s_2, \ldots, x_n, s_n\) are integers, `dp` is a list of length \(m + 1\) where `dp[0]` is 0, and for each index `i` in the range \([0, m]\), `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum value computed by the loop over all antennas, and all other elements are no longer `float('inf')` but reflect the optimal values based on the dynamic programming updates. The loop iterates over each antenna in `antennas`, and for each antenna, it updates the `dp` array from `m` down to `x - s - 1`, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated for each position. Variables `n`, `m`, and `antennas` remain constant throughout the loop.
    print(dp[m])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input data consisting of integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 80\) and \(n \leq m \leq 100,000\)), followed by `n` pairs of integers \((x_i, s_i)\) (where \(1 \leq x_i \leq m\) and \(0 \leq s_i \leq m\), and all \(x_i\) are distinct). It then processes this data to compute the minimum cost required to cover the entire range from 0 to \(m\) using the given antennas. The function sorts the list of antennas based on their positions \(x_i\) and uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost. Finally, it prints the minimum cost to cover the range up to \(m\). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. If the input does not meet the specified constraints, the behavior of the function is undefined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical flaw in how it updates the dynamic programming (DP) array. Specifically, the update rule for the DP array is incorrect. The program attempts to update `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))`, which does not correctly account for the scope of the antenna and the cost to extend its coverage.

A correct approach would involve calculating the minimum cost to cover each position from 1 to `m` by considering the cost to extend the scope of each antenna to cover the current position. The current implementation fails to handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 10
2 1
5 1
8 1
```
The expected output should be `4` because:
- The first antenna (at position 2 with scope 1) can be extended by 1 to cover [1, 3].
- The second antenna (at position 5 with scope 1) can be extended by 1 to cover [4, 6].
- The third antenna (at position 8 with scope 1) can be extended by 2 to cover [6, 10].

However, the provided program will produce an incorrect result due to the flawed DP update rule. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
