Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming (DP). It initializes a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins required to cover up to position `i` on the street. The key steps are:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of antennas `n` and the length of the street `m`, followed by the positions and initial scopes of the antennas.
2. **Sorting Antennas**: The antennas are sorted by their positions `x`.
3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The DP array is initialized with infinity values except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 0 (no cost to cover position 0).
4. **DP Transition**: For each antenna `(x, s)`, the program iterates over the positions from `m` down to `x - s - 1`. For each position `i`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and the cost to extend the antenna's coverage to include position `i`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Incorrect DP Update**: The update `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + (i - x + s))` is incorrect. The term `(i - x + s)` should represent the additional cost to extend the antenna's scope to cover position `i`. However, this calculation is not correct. The correct additional cost should be the difference between the required scope to cover `i` and the current scope `s`.

A corrected version of the DP update should be:
```python
required_scope = max(0, i - x + s + 1)
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i - x - s)] + required_scope)
```

Additionally, the program should ensure that the antenna can cover the entire range `[1, m]` and handle edge cases properly.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
