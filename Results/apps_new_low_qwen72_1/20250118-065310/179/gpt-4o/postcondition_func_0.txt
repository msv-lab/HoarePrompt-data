The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. It then calculates the number of moves as `(n - 11) // 2` and counts the occurrences of the digit '8' in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. If the count of '8's is greater than the number of moves, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` remains an odd integer such that 13 â‰¤ n < 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits, `moves` is `(n - 11) // 2`, and `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`.
