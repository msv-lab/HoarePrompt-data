Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Vasya can guarantee a win is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Moves**: The variable `moves` is calculated as `(n - 11) // 2`. This represents the number of moves each player will make to reduce the string to 11 characters. However, this calculation is correct, but the logic used to determine if Vasya can win is incorrect.

2. **Flawed Logic for Counting '8'**: The program counts the number of '8's in the prefix of the string that will be removed (`s[:n - 11]`). This is not the correct approach. The critical part of the game is ensuring that Vasya can always leave a string of 11 characters starting with '8', regardless of Petya's moves.

3. **Correct Approach**: To determine if Vasya has a winning strategy, we need to check if Vasya can always ensure that the 11th character (after the game ends) is '8'. This means Vasya should be able to force the string to have an '8' at the 11th position after all moves are made. This requires a more sophisticated analysis of the positions of '8's in the string and the parity of the moves.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
13
8073456193508
```
- The string length is 13, and the first character is '8'.
- The program calculates `moves` as `(13 - 11) // 2 = 1`.
- The program counts the number of '8's in the prefix `s[:2]`, which is `1`.

According to the program, since `count_8` (1) is not greater than `moves` (1), it prints 'NO'.

However, Vasya can actually win this game by ensuring that the 11th character is '8'. Here's how:
- Vasya can remove the second character '0', leaving the string `873456193508`.
- Petya can remove any character, but Vasya can always ensure that the 11th character remains '8' by removing appropriate characters.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this case, making it incorrect.
