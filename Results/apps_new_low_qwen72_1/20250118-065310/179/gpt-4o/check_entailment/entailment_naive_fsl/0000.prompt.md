You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) â€” the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    moves = (n - 11) // 2
    count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if count_8 > moves:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
