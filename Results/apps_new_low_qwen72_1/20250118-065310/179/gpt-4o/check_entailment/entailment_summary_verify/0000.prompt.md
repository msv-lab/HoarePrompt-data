You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    moves = (n - 11) // 2
    count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if count_8 > moves:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. It then calculates the number of moves as `(n - 11) // 2` and counts the occurrences of the digit '8' in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. If the count of '8's is greater than the number of moves, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` remains an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits, `moves` is `(n - 11) // 2`, and `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Vasya can guarantee a win is flawed. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Moves**: The variable `moves` is calculated as `(n - 11) // 2`. This represents the number of moves each player will make to reduce the string to 11 characters. However, this calculation is correct, but the logic used to determine if Vasya can win is incorrect.

2. **Flawed Logic for Counting '8'**: The program counts the number of '8's in the prefix of the string that will be removed (`s[:n - 11]`). This is not the correct approach. The critical part of the game is ensuring that Vasya can always leave a string of 11 characters starting with '8', regardless of Petya's moves.

3. **Correct Approach**: To determine if Vasya has a winning strategy, we need to check if Vasya can always ensure that the 11th character (after the game ends) is '8'. This means Vasya should be able to force the string to have an '8' at the 11th position after all moves are made. This requires a more sophisticated analysis of the positions of '8's in the string and the parity of the moves.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
13
8073456193508
```
- The string length is 13, and the first character is '8'.
- The program calculates `moves` as `(13 - 11) // 2 = 1`.
- The program counts the number of '8's in the prefix `s[:2]`, which is `1`.

According to the program, since `count_8` (1) is not greater than `moves` (1), it prints 'NO'.

However, Vasya can actually win this game by ensuring that the 11th character is '8'. Here's how:
- Vasya can remove the second character '0', leaving the string `873456193508`.
- Petya can remove any character, but Vasya can always ensure that the 11th character remains '8' by removing appropriate characters.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this case, making it incorrect.
