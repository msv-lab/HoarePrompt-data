### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - The game involves reducing a string `s` of length `n` (where `n` is odd and \( 13 \le n < 10^5 \)) to a string of length 11.
   - Vasya wins if the resulting string is a telephone number, i.e., it starts with '8' and is exactly 11 digits long.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The total number of moves required to reduce the string from length `n` to 11 is \( n - 11 \).
   - Since Vasya goes first, the distribution of moves is:
     - Vasya makes \( \left\lceil \frac{n - 11}{2} \right\rceil \) moves.
     - Petya makes \( \left\lfloor \frac{n - 11}{2} \right\rfloor \) moves.
   - To ensure Vasya wins, the final string must start with '8'. This means that Vasya must ensure that at least one '8' remains in the final 11-character string.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates the number of moves as \( \text{moves} = \frac{n - 11}{2} \).
   - It counts the number of '8's in the first \( n - 11 \) characters of the string `s`.
   - If the count of '8's in this part is greater than the number of moves Petya can make, Vasya can ensure that at least one '8' remains in the final string, guaranteeing his win.

4. **Verification Using Function Summary**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input.
   - It calculates the number of moves as \( \text{moves} = \frac{n - 11}{2} \).
   - It counts the occurrences of the digit '8' in the substring `s[:n - 11]`.
   - If the count of '8's is greater than the number of moves, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the number of moves each player can make.
   - The program correctly counts the number of '8's in the relevant part of the string.
   - The logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy is sound because if there are more '8's in the first \( n - 11 \) characters than the number of moves Petya can make, Vasya can always ensure that at least one '8' remains in the final string.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic aligns with the game rules and correctly determines whether Vasya has a winning strategy. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
