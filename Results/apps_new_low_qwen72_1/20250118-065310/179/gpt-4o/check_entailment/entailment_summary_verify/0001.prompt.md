You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    moves = (n - 11) // 2
    count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if count_8 > moves:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. It then calculates the number of moves as `(n - 11) // 2` and counts the occurrences of the digit '8' in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. If the count of '8's is greater than the number of moves, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` remains an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits, `moves` is `(n - 11) // 2`, and `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine if Vasya has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game dynamics. The key points are:

1. **Initial String Length**: The initial string length \( n \) is odd and greater than or equal to 13.
2. **Final String Length**: The game ends when the string length is 11.
3. **Winning Condition**: Vasya wins if the final string starts with '8' and is exactly 11 digits long.

### Key Observations:
- **Total Moves**: The total number of moves required to reduce the string from length \( n \) to 11 is \( n - 11 \).
- **Turns Distribution**: Since the game alternates between Vasya and Petya, and Vasya goes first, Vasya will make \( \frac{n - 11 + 1}{2} \) moves, and Petya will make \( \frac{n - 11 - 1}{2} \) moves.
- **Critical Position**: To ensure Vasya wins, he must ensure that the 11th character of the final string is '8'. This means that the first '8' in the initial string must survive until the end.

### Strategy Analysis:
- **Count of '8'**: We need to count the number of '8's in the part of the string that will be left after both players make their moves. Specifically, we need to consider the first \( n - 11 \) characters because these are the characters that will be removed.
- **Moves Calculation**: The number of moves each player can make is calculated as \( \text{moves} = \frac{n - 11}{2} \).

### Program Logic:
- **Count '8' in Relevant Part**: The program counts the number of '8's in the first \( n - 11 \) characters.
- **Winning Condition**: If the number of '8's in this part is greater than the number of moves Petya can make, Vasya can ensure that at least one '8' remains in the final string, guaranteeing his win.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the number of moves and the number of '8's in the relevant part of the string.
- The logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy is sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
