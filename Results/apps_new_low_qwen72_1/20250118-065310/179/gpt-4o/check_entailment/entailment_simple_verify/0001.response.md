Reasoning:
To determine if Vasya has a winning strategy, we need to carefully analyze the conditions under which Vasya can ensure that the final 11-digit string starts with '8'. The key points are:

1. **Initial String Length**: The initial string length \( n \) is odd and greater than or equal to 13.
2. **Final String Length**: The game ends when the string length is 11.
3. **Winning Condition**: Vasya wins if the final string starts with '8' and is exactly 11 digits long.

### Key Observations:
- **Total Moves**: The total number of moves required to reduce the string from length \( n \) to 11 is \( n - 11 \).
- **Turns Distribution**: Since the game alternates between Vasya and Petya, and Vasya goes first, Vasya will make \( \frac{n - 11 + 1}{2} \) moves, and Petya will make \( \frac{n - 11 - 1}{2} \) moves.
- **Critical Position**: To ensure Vasya wins, he must ensure that the 11th character of the final string is '8'. This means that the first '8' in the initial string must survive until the end.

### Strategy Analysis:
- **Count of '8'**: We need to count the number of '8's in the part of the string that will be left after both players make their moves. Specifically, we need to consider the first \( n - 11 \) characters because these are the characters that will be removed.
- **Moves Calculation**: The number of moves each player can make is calculated as \( \text{moves} = \frac{n - 11}{2} \).

### Program Logic:
- **Count '8' in Relevant Part**: The program counts the number of '8's in the first \( n - 11 \) characters.
- **Winning Condition**: If the number of '8's in this part is greater than the number of moves Petya can make, Vasya can ensure that at least one '8' remains in the final string, guaranteeing his win.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes \( n \) and \( s \) from the input.
- **Moves Calculation**: The calculation of moves \( \text{moves} = (n - 11) // 2 \) is correct.
- **Count '8'**: The program correctly counts the number of '8's in the first \( n - 11 \) characters using `s[:n - 11].count('8')`.
- **Winning Condition**: The condition `if count_8 > moves` is correct. If Vasya has more '8's in the first \( n - 11 \) characters than the number of moves Petya can make, Vasya can always ensure that at least one '8' remains in the final string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
