Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. This aligns with the problem's requirement for the input format.

2. **Move Calculation**: The program calculates the number of moves each player can make as `(n - 11) // 2`. This is correct because the game continues until the string length is reduced to 11, and each player alternates turns, so the total number of moves is indeed `(n - 11) // 2`.

3. **Counting '8's**: The program counts the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. This is the part of the string that will be affected by the players' moves before the string reaches length 11. If Vasya can ensure that there are more '8's in this initial segment than the number of moves, he can always force the final string to start with '8', making it a telephone number.

4. **Winning Condition**: The program checks if `count_8 > moves`. If this condition is true, Vasya can always make a move to ensure the final string starts with '8'. If `count_8 <= moves`, Petya can always prevent the final string from starting with '8' by erasing enough '8's.

5. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' if Vasya has a winning strategy and 'NO' otherwise. This is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy based on the given rules and input constraints.

Correctness: **True**
