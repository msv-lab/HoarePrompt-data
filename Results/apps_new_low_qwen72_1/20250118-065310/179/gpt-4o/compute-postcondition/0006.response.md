The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. 

- `n` is an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits.

Since the output section is empty, it implies that the function's behavior or return value is not specified. However, for the purpose of describing the functionality, we can assume that the function processes these parameters in some way, but without specific output details, we cannot determine what exactly it returns.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters, `n` and `s`, where `n` is an odd integer within the specified range and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only decimal digits. The exact return value or behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n` (an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5) and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits). The exact return value or behavior of the function is not specified.**
