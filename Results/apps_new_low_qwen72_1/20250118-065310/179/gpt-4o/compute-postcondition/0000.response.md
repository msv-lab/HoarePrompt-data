The first line assigns the integer value of the input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, to `n`. The second line assigns the input string, also stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, to `s`. The third line calculates the number of moves as `(n - 11) // 2` and assigns this value to `moves`. The fourth line counts the occurrences of the character '8' in the substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the index `n - 11` and assigns this count to `count_8`.

Given the initial conditions that `n` is an odd integer such that 13 <= n < 10^5 and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits, the final state after executing the code block is:

Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 13 <= n < 10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of decimal digits, moves is (n - 11) // 2, count_8 is the number of '8's in the substring s[:n - 11]**
