Postcondition: ***n is an odd integer such that 13 <= n < 10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of decimal digits, moves is (n - 11) // 2, and count_8 is the number of '8's in the substring s[:n - 11]. If count_8 > moves, the program continues without printing anything. If count_8 <= moves, 'NO' is printed.***
