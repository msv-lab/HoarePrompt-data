The code snippet `print('YES')` outputs the string `'YES'` to the console. This action does not modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 13 <= n < 10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of decimal digits, moves is (n - 11) // 2, count_8 is the number of '8's in the substring s[:n - 11], and count_8 is greater than moves**
