Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. It then calculates the number of moves as `(n - 11) // 2` and counts the occurrences of the digit '8' in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. If the count of '8's is greater than the number of moves, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` remains an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits, `moves` is `(n - 11) // 2`, and `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Input Validation:** The function assumes that the input values meet the specified conditions (i.e., `n` is an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits). If these conditions are not met, the function may behave unpredictably.
- **Edge Case for `n = 13`:** When `n = 13`, `moves` becomes 1, and the substring `s[:n - 11]` is `s[:2]`. This means the function checks for the presence of '8' in the first two characters of `s`.
- **Edge Case for Maximum `n`:** When `n` approaches the upper limit of 10^5, `moves` increases, but the function's logic remains consistent in counting '8's in the appropriate substring and comparing it to `moves`.
- **No Return Value:** The function does not return any value; it only prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition.
