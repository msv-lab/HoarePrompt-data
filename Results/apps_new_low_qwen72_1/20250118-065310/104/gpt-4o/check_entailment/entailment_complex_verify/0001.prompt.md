You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
    print(max_erase)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_erase = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is `max(a[i] - a[i-1] - 1 for i in range(1, n))`, `i` is `n-1`.
    print(max_erase)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user input. It calculates the maximum number of elements that can be erased between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` without changing the order of the remaining elements. The function then prints this maximum number. The final state of the program is that `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, and `max_erase` holds the maximum difference minus one between any two consecutive elements in `a`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` is 1 (in which case `max_erase` will be 0 since there are no pairs of elements to compare).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program aims to find the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from an increasing sequence of integers, while still allowing the original sequence to be reconstructed. The logic used is to iterate through the array and calculate the gap between consecutive elements, which indicates how many elements could have been between them. This is done by computing `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` for each pair of consecutive elements, where `a[i]` is the current element and `a[i - 1]` is the previous element. The result is the maximum value of these gaps, which represents the largest number of elements that can be erased between any two elements in the array.

However, the program does not account for edge cases where the entire array or almost the entire array can be erased, such as when the first few or last few elements are very close to the bounds (1 and 1000). For instance, in the case where the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program correctly outputs `4` because the maximum gap is between the first and last elements. However, for an array like `[998, 999, 1000]`, the program should output `2` (as shown in the examples), but it currently outputs `0` because the maximum gap between any two consecutive elements is `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the special cases at the boundaries of the array. Specifically, it should check the gap between the smallest element and 1, and the largest element and 1000, and include these in the calculation of the maximum number of erasable elements.
