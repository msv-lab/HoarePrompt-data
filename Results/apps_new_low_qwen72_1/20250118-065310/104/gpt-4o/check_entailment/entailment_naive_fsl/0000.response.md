Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the edge case where the entire array except the first or last element can be erased. According to the problem description, the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased should be such that the array can still be uniquely restored. The current implementation calculates the maximum gap between consecutive elements and subtracts 1, which is incorrect for certain edge cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `4`, because all but one of the elements can be erased, and the array can still be uniquely restored. However, the provided code would output `0` because the maximum difference between consecutive elements is 1, and `1 - 1 = 0`.

Another example:
```
3
998 999 1000
```
The expected output is `2`, but the provided code would output `0` for the same reason.

To correctly solve the problem, the solution should check the gaps at the beginning and end of the array as well, and consider the possibility of erasing all but one element from the start or end of the array.
