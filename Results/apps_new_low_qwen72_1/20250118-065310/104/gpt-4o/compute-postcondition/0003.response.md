The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (making it 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be at least 3).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is `max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
