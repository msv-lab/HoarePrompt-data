The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is `max(max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1)`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
