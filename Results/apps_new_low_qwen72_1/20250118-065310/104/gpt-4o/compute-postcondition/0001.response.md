To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`, which means `i` will start from 1 and go up to but not including `n`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` will produce an empty sequence if `n` is 1 or less).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3
- `max_erase` is 0

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (to ensure the range is not empty)
- `i` will be 1 during the first iteration

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 1**
