The code updates the value of `max_erase` by comparing its current value with the difference between the elements `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `n` must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3.
- `max_erase` is initially set to `max(max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1)`.
- `i` is 3.

The code snippet:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
```

Steps:
1. Calculate the new potential value of `max_erase` using `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`.
2. Compare this value with the current `max_erase`.
3. Update `max_erase` to the maximum of these two values.

Given that `i` is 3, the calculation involves `a[3] - a[2] - 1`.

Since the exact values of `a[2]` and `a[3]` are not specified, we can only express the updated `max_erase` in terms of the original and new comparison:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is `max(max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1, a[3] - a[2] - 1)`, `i` is 3**
