The code snippet updates the value of `max_erase` based on the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `max_erase` is initially set to `max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)`, and `i` is 2. The new value of `max_erase` is determined by taking the maximum of its current value and the difference `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`.

Let's break it down:

- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3.
- `max_erase` is initially `max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)`.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

The code snippet:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
```

1. Calculate `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`:
   - Since `i` is 2, this becomes `a[2] - a[1] - 1`.

2. Update `max_erase`:
   - `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[2] - a[1] - 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `max_erase` is:
- `max_erase = max(max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1)`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is `max(max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1), a[2] - a[1] - 1)`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
