The code prints the value of `max_erase`, which is defined as the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` minus one. This operation does not change any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is `max(a[i] - a[i-1] - 1 for i in range(1, n))`, `i` is `n-1`.**
