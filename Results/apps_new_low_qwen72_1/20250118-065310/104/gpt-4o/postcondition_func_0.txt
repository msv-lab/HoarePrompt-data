The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user input. It calculates the maximum number of elements that can be erased between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` without changing the order of the remaining elements. The function then prints this maximum number. The final state of the program is that `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] ≤ 10^3, and `max_erase` holds the maximum difference minus one between any two consecutive elements in `a`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` is 1 (in which case `max_erase` will be 0 since there are no pairs of elements to compare).
