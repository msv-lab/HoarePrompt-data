To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `half_n` is \(\frac{n}{2}\) and must be at least 1.
- `i` is `half_n`.
- `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`.
- `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`.
- If `ticket[i]` is '?', `right_question_marks` is either 1 or 2, and `right_sum` is 0.
- Otherwise, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer value of the character at index `half_n - 1` and the integer value of the character at index `half_n` in `ticket`, and `right_question_marks` is 1 if the character at index `half_n - 1` in `ticket` is '?', otherwise it remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(half_n, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `half_n` to `n`.
- At the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- `n` must remain the same for the loop to continue executing.

### Initial State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` was `half_n` at the end of the previous iteration.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `half_n + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \(\frac{n}{2}\) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n + 1`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` and `right_sum` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
