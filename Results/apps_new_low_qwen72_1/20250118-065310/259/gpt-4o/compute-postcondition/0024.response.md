The code snippet `right_sum += int(ticket[i])` impacts the `right_sum` variable by adding the integer value of the character at index `i` in the string `ticket`. The initial state provides that `i` is `half_n`, which is `n / 2`.

Given that `right_sum` initially includes the integer value of the character at index `half_n - 1` (if it's not a '?'), the addition of `int(ticket[i])` updates `right_sum` by including the integer value of the character at index `i`.

Since `i` is `half_n`, and `half_n` is at least 1, this means that the character being added to `right_sum` is the next character in the sequence from the one already considered (if any).

The other variables (`n`, `half_n`, `i`, `left_sum`, `left_question_marks`, and `right_question_marks`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \), `i` is `half_n`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer value of the character at index `half_n - 1` and the integer value of the character at index `half_n` in `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is 1 if the character at index `half_n - 1` in `ticket` is '?', otherwise it remains 0.**
