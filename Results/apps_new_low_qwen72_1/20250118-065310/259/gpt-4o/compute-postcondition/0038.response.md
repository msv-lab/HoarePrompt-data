Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and `ticket` (a string of length `n` containing digits and an even number of '?' characters). It calculates the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first and second halves of the `ticket` string (`left_sum` and `right_sum`, respectively) and the count of '?' characters in each half (`left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`). The function then determines whether the expression `(left_sum - right_sum + (left_question_marks - right_question_marks) // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` holds true. If it does, the function prints 'Bicarp'; otherwise, it prints 'Monocarp'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `n = 2` and both characters in `ticket` are non-'?', or when `ticket` contains only '?' characters. In these cases, the function still correctly evaluates the condition and prints the appropriate result. **
