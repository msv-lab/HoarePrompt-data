To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the relevant variables are `i` and `half_n`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even.
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1.
- `i` is 0.
- If the character at position `i` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 1, and `left_sum`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0.
- Otherwise, if the character at position `i` in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[i]`), and `left_question_marks`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(half_n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `half_n`.

Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `half_n`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `ticket` remains a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even.
- `half_n` remains \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1.
- `i` is now 1.
- The values of `left_question_marks`, `left_sum`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` depend on the character at position `i` in `ticket` after the increment.

### Final State:
- If the character at position `i` (which is now 1) in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 1, and `left_sum`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0.
- Otherwise, if the character at position `i` (which is now 1) in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[1]`), and `left_question_marks`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is 1. If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 1, and `left_sum`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0. Otherwise, if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[1]`), and `left_question_marks`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0.**
