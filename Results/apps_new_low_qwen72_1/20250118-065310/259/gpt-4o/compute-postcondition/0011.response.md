To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `half_n`.

### Given:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even.
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1.
- `i` is 1.
- The initial conditions based on the character at position `1` in `ticket` are as follows:
  - If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?':
    - `left_question_marks` is 2.
    - `left_sum` is 0.
    - `right_sum` is 0.
    - `right_question_marks` is 0.
  - If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit:
    - `left_sum` is `2 * d` (where `d` is the integer value of `ticket[1]`).
    - `left_question_marks` is 0.
    - `right_sum` is 0.
    - `right_question_marks` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(half_n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `half_n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- To execute the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- `half_n` remains the same, as it is derived from `n` and does not change within the loop.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1 to 2.
- `half_n` remains the same and must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 2, `i` is 2. If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 2, `left_sum` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, and `right_question_marks` is 0. Otherwise, if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `2 * d` (where `d` is the integer value of `ticket[1]`), `left_question_marks` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, and `right_question_marks` is 0.**
