Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`. If `ticket[i]` is '?', `right_question_marks` is either 1 or 2, and `right_sum` is 0. Otherwise, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer value of the character at index `half_n - 1` and the integer value of the character at index `half_n` in `ticket`, and `right_question_marks` is 1 if the character at index `half_n - 1` in `ticket` is '?', otherwise it remains 0.***
