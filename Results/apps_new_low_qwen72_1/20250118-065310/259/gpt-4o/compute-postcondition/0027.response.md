The value of `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \(\frac{n}{2}\) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n + 1`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is `right_question_marks + 1`, `right_sum` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
