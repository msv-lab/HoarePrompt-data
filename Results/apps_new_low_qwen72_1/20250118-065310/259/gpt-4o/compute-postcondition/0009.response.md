The code snippet `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` updates the value of `left_sum` by adding the integer value of the character at index `i` in the string `ticket`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1
- `i` is 1
- If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 1, and `left_sum`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0
- Otherwise, if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[1]`), and `left_question_marks`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0

Let's consider the two cases for the character at position `1` in `ticket`:

### Case 1: `ticket[1]` is '?'
- `left_question_marks` is 1
- `left_sum` is 0
- `right_sum` is 0
- `right_question_marks` is 0

When the code `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` is executed:
- Since `i` is 1, `ticket[i]` is `ticket[1]`
- `ticket[1]` is '?', which cannot be converted to an integer
- This would raise a `ValueError` and the code would not execute successfully

Since the code raises an error, the state remains unchanged.

### Case 2: `ticket[1]` is a digit
- Let `d` be the integer value of `ticket[1]`
- `left_sum` is `d`
- `left_question_marks` is 0
- `right_sum` is 0
- `right_question_marks` is 0

When the code `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` is executed:
- Since `i` is 1, `ticket[i]` is `ticket[1]`
- `ticket[1]` is a digit, so `int(ticket[i])` is `d`
- `left_sum` is updated to `left_sum + d`, which is `d + d` or `2 * d`

Therefore, the output state for this case is:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1
- `i` is 1
- `left_sum` is `2 * d`
- `left_question_marks` is 0
- `right_sum` is 0
- `right_question_marks` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `left_sum` is `2 * d`, `left_question_marks` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0**
