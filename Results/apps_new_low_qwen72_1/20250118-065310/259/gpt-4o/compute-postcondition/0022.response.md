To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the variables in the loop head:

- `i`: The loop variable.
- `n`: The upper bound for the loop.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1.
- `i` is `half_n - 1`.
- `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`.
- `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`.
- If the character at index `i` in `ticket` is '?', then `right_sum` remains 0 and `right_question_marks` is 1. Otherwise, `right_sum` is updated to include the integer value of the character at index `i` in `ticket`, and `right_question_marks` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition `i in range(half_n, n)` must be true. This means:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `i` must be less than `n`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` is incremented from `half_n - 1` to `half_n`.
- `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `right_sum` is 0 if the character at index `half_n - 1` in `ticket` is '?', otherwise it includes the integer value of the character at index `half_n - 1`, and `right_question_marks` is 1 if the character at index `half_n - 1` in `ticket` is '?', otherwise it remains 0.**
