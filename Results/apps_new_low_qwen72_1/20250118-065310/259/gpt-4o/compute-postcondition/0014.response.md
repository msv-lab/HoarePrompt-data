Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0. If `ticket[1]` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 3 and `left_sum` is 0. If `ticket[1]` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `2 * d` (where `d` is the integer value of `ticket[1]`), and `left_question_marks` is 0. If `ticket[2]` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 3 if `ticket[1]` is '?' or 1 if `ticket[1]` is a digit. If `ticket[2]` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `left_sum + int(ticket[2])`, and `left_question_marks` is 2 if `ticket[1]` is '?' or 0 if `ticket[1]` is a digit.***
