The code snippet updates the `right_sum` by adding the integer value of the character at index `i` in the string `ticket`. 

Given:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `half_n` is \(\frac{n}{2}\) and must be at least 1
- `i` is `half_n + 1`
- `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`
- `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`
- `right_question_marks` and `right_sum` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration

The code snippet:
```
right_sum += int(ticket[i])
```

Impact:
- `right_sum` is updated by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `half_n`, `i`, `left_sum`, `left_question_marks`, `right_question_marks`) remain unchanged.

Since `i` is `half_n + 1`, and `half_n` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `i` points to the first character in the second half of the `ticket` string.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \(\frac{n}{2}\) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n + 1`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` remains as it was, `right_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[half_n + 1]`.**
