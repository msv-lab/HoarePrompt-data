The code snippet increments the value of `right_question_marks` by 1. The initial state specifies that `right_question_marks` is 0, so after executing the code, `right_question_marks` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n - 1`, `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 1, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`. The character at position `i` in `ticket` is '?'.**
