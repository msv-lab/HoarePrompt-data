Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n - 1`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`. If the character at index `i` in `ticket` is '?', then `right_sum` remains 0 and `right_question_marks` is 1. Otherwise, `right_sum` is updated to include the integer value of the character at index `i` in `ticket`, and `right_question_marks` remains 0.***
