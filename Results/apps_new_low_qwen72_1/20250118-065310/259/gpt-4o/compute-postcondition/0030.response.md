Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the second half of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of `ticket`. The loop executes if `n > 2`, and does not execute if `n = 2` and both characters in `ticket` are non-'?'.**
