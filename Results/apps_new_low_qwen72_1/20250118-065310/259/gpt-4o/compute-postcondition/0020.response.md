The code snippet adds the integer value of the character at index `i` in `ticket` to `right_sum`. Since `i` is `half_n - 1`, and the character at this index is not '?', `right_sum` will be updated to include this integer value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1
- `i` is `half_n - 1`
- `right_sum` is 0
- `right_question_marks` is 0
- `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`
- `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`
- The character at index `i` in `ticket` is not '?'

After executing the code snippet:
- `right_sum` is updated to include the integer value of the character at index `i` in `ticket`, which is `int(ticket[half_n - 1])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n - 1`, `right_sum` is `int(ticket[half_n - 1])`, `right_question_marks` is 0, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, the character at index `i` in `ticket` is not '?'**.
