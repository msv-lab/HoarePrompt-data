Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is \( n - 1 \), `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of ticket, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of ticket, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the second half of ticket, `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of ticket, `diff` is \( left_sum - right_sum \), `q_diff` is \( left_question_marks - right_question_marks \), and \((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 \neq 0\)**
