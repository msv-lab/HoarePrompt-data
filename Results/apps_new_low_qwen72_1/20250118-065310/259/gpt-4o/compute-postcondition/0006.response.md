Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is 0. If the character at position `i` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 1, and `left_sum`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0. Otherwise, if the character at position `i` in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[i]`), and `left_question_marks`, `right_sum`, and `right_question_marks` are all 0.***
