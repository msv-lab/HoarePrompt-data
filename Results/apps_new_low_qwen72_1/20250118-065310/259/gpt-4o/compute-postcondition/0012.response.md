The code snippet `left_question_marks += 1` increments the value of `left_question_marks` by 1. We need to determine the initial value of `left_question_marks` based on the initial state.

From the initial state:
- If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 2.
- Otherwise, if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_question_marks` is 0.

Let's consider both cases:

1. **If `ticket[1]` is '?':**
   - Initial `left_question_marks` is 2.
   - After executing `left_question_marks += 1`, `left_question_marks` becomes 3.

2. **If `ticket[1]` is a digit:**
   - Initial `left_question_marks` is 0.
   - After executing `left_question_marks += 1`, `left_question_marks` becomes 1.

Since the initial state does not specify which case applies, we need to cover both possibilities in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `left_sum` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0, and `left_question_marks` is either 3 if `ticket[1]` is '?' or 1 if `ticket[1]` is a digit.**
