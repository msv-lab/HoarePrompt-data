Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is 1. If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 2, `left_sum` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, and `right_question_marks` is 0. Otherwise, if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_sum` is `2 * d` (where `d` is the integer value of `ticket[1]`), `left_question_marks` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, and `right_question_marks` is 0.***
