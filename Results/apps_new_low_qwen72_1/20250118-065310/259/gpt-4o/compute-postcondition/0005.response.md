The code snippet `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` updates the value of `left_sum` by adding the integer value of the character at position `i` in the string `ticket`.

- `left_sum` was initially 0. After the execution, `left_sum` is updated to the integer value of `ticket[i]`.
- The value of `ticket[i]` is not a question mark (`?`) as per the initial state, so it must be a digit. Let's denote this digit as `d` (where `0 <= d <= 9`).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[i]`), `right_sum` is 0, `left_question_marks` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0, `i` is 0, and the character at position `i` in `ticket` is not '?'**
