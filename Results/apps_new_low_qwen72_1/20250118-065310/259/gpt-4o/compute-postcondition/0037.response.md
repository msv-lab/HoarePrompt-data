The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, but based on common programming tasks involving strings with '?' characters, we can infer that the function might involve processing or validating the `ticket` string in some way, possibly replacing the '?' characters or checking conditions related to the digits and '?' characters.

However, without specific details about the expected output, the most accurate description of the function's functionality is:

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits and an even number of '?' characters. The exact return value or behavior of the function is not specified.**
