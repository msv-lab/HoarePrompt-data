The code snippet `left_question_marks += 1` increments the value of `left_question_marks` by 1. Given the initial state, we need to consider two cases based on the character at position `1` in the `ticket` string.

### Case 1: The character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?'
- Initial State: `left_question_marks` is 1, `left_sum` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0.
- After executing `left_question_marks += 1`, `left_question_marks` becomes 2.

### Case 2: The character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit
- Initial State: `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[1]`), `left_question_marks` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0.
- After executing `left_question_marks += 1`, `left_question_marks` becomes 1.

Since the initial state specifies that if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 1, and otherwise, if the character is a digit, then `left_question_marks` is 0, we can conclude the following:

### Final Output State:
- If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?':
  - `left_question_marks` is 2.
  - `left_sum` is 0.
  - `right_sum` is 0.
  - `right_question_marks` is 0.
- If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit:
  - `left_question_marks` is 1.
  - `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[1]`).
  - `right_sum` is 0.
  - `right_question_marks` is 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?', then `left_question_marks` is 2, `left_sum` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0; otherwise, if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit, then `left_question_marks` is 1, `left_sum` is `d` (the integer value of `ticket[1]`), `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0.**
