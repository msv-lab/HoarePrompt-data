To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State Before the Loop Starts:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even.
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1.
- `i` is `half_n - 1`.
- `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` are 0.
- `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`.
- `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(half_n, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(half_n, n)` is non-empty. This means `half_n` must be less than `n`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is `half_n - 1`. However, this value is not used in the loop head; the loop will start with `i` equal to `half_n`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- `half_n` must be less than `n`.
- Since `half_n` is defined as \( \frac{n}{2} \), it is always less than `n` for any valid `n` (which is at least 2).

### Final State:
The loop will execute if `half_n` is less than `n`, which is always true given the constraints on `n`.

Therefore, the state that must hold true for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1.
- `i` is `half_n - 1` (but this is not relevant to the loop condition).

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n - 1`, `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` are 0, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, and `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`.**
