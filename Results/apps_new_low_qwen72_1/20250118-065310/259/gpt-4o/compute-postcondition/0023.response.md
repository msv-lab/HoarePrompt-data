The value of `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `right_question_marks` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition of the character at index `half_n - 1`. After the increment, `right_question_marks` will be either 1 or 2, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `right_sum` is 0 if the character at index `half_n - 1` in `ticket` is '?', otherwise it includes the integer value of the character at index `half_n - 1`, and `right_question_marks` is either 1 or 2.**
