The provided code calculates two differences: `diff` and `q_diff`. The first line computes the difference between `left_sum` and `right_sum`, storing the result in `diff`. The second line computes the difference between `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`, storing the result in `q_diff`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`
- `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`
- `right_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the second half of `ticket`
- `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of `ticket`

After executing the provided code:
- `diff` is set to the value of `left_sum - right_sum`
- `q_diff` is set to the value of `left_question_marks - right_question_marks`

No other variables are modified by this code.

Output State: **n is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), half_n is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, i is \( n - 1 \), left_sum is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of ticket, left_question_marks is the count of '?' characters in the first half of ticket, right_sum is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the second half of ticket, right_question_marks is the count of '?' characters in the second half of ticket, diff is \( left_sum - right_sum \), q_diff is \( left_question_marks - right_question_marks \)**
