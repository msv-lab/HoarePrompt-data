Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \(\frac{n}{2}\) and must be at least 1, `i` is `half_n + 1`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of `ticket`, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of `ticket`. If `ticket[i]` is '?', then `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1, and `right_sum` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `right_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[i]`, and `right_question_marks` remains unchanged.***
