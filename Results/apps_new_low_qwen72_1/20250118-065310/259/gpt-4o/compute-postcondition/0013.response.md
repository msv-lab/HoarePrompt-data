The code snippet updates the `left_sum` by adding the integer value of the character at index `i` in the `ticket` string. Given that `i` is 2, the character at index 2 of `ticket` is converted to an integer and added to `left_sum`.

Initial State:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 2
- `i` is 2
- If the character at position `1` in `ticket` is '?', then:
  - `left_question_marks` is 2
  - `left_sum` is 0
  - `right_sum` is 0
  - `right_question_marks` is 0
- Otherwise, if the character at position `1` in `ticket` is a digit, then:
  - `left_sum` is `2 * d` (where `d` is the integer value of `ticket[1]`)
  - `left_question_marks` is 0
  - `right_sum` is 0
  - `right_question_marks` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `left_sum` is updated to its original value plus the integer value of `ticket[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `left_sum` is `left_sum + int(ticket[2])`, `left_question_marks` is 2 if `ticket[1]` is '?', otherwise `left_question_marks` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0**
