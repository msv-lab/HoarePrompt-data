The code snippet increments the value of `left_question_marks` by 1. Since the initial value of `left_question_marks` is 0, after executing this code, `left_question_marks` becomes 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1
- `left_sum` is 0
- `right_sum` is 0
- `left_question_marks` is 1
- `right_question_marks` is 0
- `i` is 0
- The character at position `i` in `ticket` is '?'

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `left_sum` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, `left_question_marks` is 1, `right_question_marks` is 0, `i` is 0, and the character at position `i` in `ticket` is '?'.**
