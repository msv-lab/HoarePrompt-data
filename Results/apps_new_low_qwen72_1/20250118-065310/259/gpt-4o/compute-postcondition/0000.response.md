The provided code initializes several variables based on the initial state. Let's break down the combined effect of all the lines of code:

- `half_n = n // 2`: This line calculates half of `n` and assigns it to `half_n`. Since `n` is an even integer, `half_n` will also be an integer.
- `left_sum = 0`: Initializes `left_sum` to 0.
- `right_sum = 0`: Initializes `right_sum` to 0.
- `left_question_marks = 0`: Initializes `left_question_marks` to 0.
- `right_question_marks = 0`: Initializes `right_question_marks` to 0.

None of the initial state variables (`n` and `ticket`) are modified by the code. The new variables are initialized with specific values as described above.

Output State: **n is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), ticket is a string of length n consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, half_n is \( \frac{n}{2} \), left_sum is 0, right_sum is 0, left_question_marks is 0, right_question_marks is 0**.
