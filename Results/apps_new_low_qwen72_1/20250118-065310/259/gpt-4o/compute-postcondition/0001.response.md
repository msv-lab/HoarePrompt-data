To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even.
- `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \).
- `left_sum` is 0.
- `right_sum` is 0.
- `left_question_marks` is 0.
- `right_question_marks` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(half_n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `i` is within the range from 0 to `half_n - 1`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \), which is a positive integer because `n` is an even integer and \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `half_n` must be at least 1. This means `n` must be at least 2 (since \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)).

### Required States:
- `half_n` must be at least 1.
- `i` must start at 0.

Given the initial conditions, we can summarize the required state as follows:

State: **`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even, `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `left_sum` is 0, `right_sum` is 0, `left_question_marks` is 0, `right_question_marks` is 0, `i` is 0**.
