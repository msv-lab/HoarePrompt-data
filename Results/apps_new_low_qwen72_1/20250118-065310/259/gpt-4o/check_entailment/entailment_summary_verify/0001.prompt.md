You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of $n$ digits ($n$ is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. The number of digits that have been erased is even.

Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first $\frac{n}{2}$ digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last $\frac{n}{2}$ digits.

Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from $0$ to $9$. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.

If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains a string of $n$ digits and "?" characters — the ticket which Monocarp and Bicarp have found. If the $i$-th character is "?", then the $i$-th digit is erased. Note that there may be leading zeroes. The number of "?" characters is even.


-----Output-----

If Monocarp wins, print "Monocarp" (without quotes). Otherwise print "Bicarp" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0523

Output
Bicarp

Input
2
??

Output
Bicarp

Input
8
?054??0?

Output
Bicarp

Input
6
???00?

Output
Monocarp



-----Note-----

Since there is no question mark in the ticket in the first example, the winner is determined before the game even starts, and it is Bicarp.

In the second example, Bicarp also wins. After Monocarp chooses an erased digit and replaces it with a new one, Bicap can choose another position with an erased digit and replace it with the same digit, so the ticket is happy.

- Program:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
func_1(n, ticket)

def func_1(n, ticket):
    half_n = n // 2
    left_sum = 0
    right_sum = 0
    left_question_marks = 0
    right_question_marks = 0
    for i in range(half_n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            left_question_marks += 1
        else:
            left_sum += int(ticket[i])
    for i in range(half_n, n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            right_question_marks += 1
        else:
            right_sum += int(ticket[i])
    diff = left_sum - right_sum
    q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
    if (diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0:
        print('Bicarp')
    else:
        print('Monocarp')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and `ticket` (a string of length `n` containing digits and an even number of '?' characters). It calculates the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first and second halves of the `ticket` string (`left_sum` and `right_sum`, respectively) and the count of '?' characters in each half (`left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`). The function then determines whether the expression `(left_sum - right_sum + (left_question_marks - right_question_marks) // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` holds true. If it does, the function prints 'Bicarp'; otherwise, it prints 'Monocarp'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `n = 2` and both characters in `ticket` are non-'?', or when `ticket` contains only '?' characters. In these cases, the function still correctly evaluates the condition and prints the appropriate result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided solution aims to determine the winner between Monocarp and Bicarp in a game involving a partially erased bus ticket. The key logic revolves around calculating the sums of the digits in the first half and the second half of the ticket, as well as counting the number of erased digits (denoted by '?') in each half. The goal is to see if Bicarp can make the ticket "happy" (i.e., the sums of the two halves are equal) by playing optimally.

### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `half_n` is calculated as `n // 2`, which correctly splits the ticket into two halves.
   - `left_sum` and `right_sum` are initialized to zero to store the sum of the digits in the first and second halves, respectively.
   - `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks` are initialized to zero to count the number of '?' in each half.

2. **Sum Calculation and Question Mark Counting**:
   - The first loop iterates over the first half of the ticket, adding the value of each digit to `left_sum` and incrementing `left_question_marks` for each '?'.
   - The second loop iterates over the second half of the ticket, adding the value of each digit to `right_sum` and incrementing `right_question_marks` for each '?'.

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - `diff` is calculated as `left_sum - right_sum`, representing the difference in the sums of the two halves.
   - `q_diff` is calculated as `left_question_marks - right_question_marks`, representing the difference in the number of '?' in the two halves.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The condition `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` is used to determine if Bicarp can make the ticket happy.
     - `q_diff // 2 * 9` represents the maximum possible adjustment Bicarp can make by replacing '?' with digits to balance the sums.
     - If the adjusted difference is divisible by 9, Bicarp can always make the ticket happy by playing optimally.
   - If the condition is met, Bicarp wins; otherwise, Monocarp wins.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly accounts for the number of '?' in each half and their potential impact on the sums.
- The condition `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` ensures that Bicarp can always balance the sums if the difference can be adjusted to a multiple of 9.
- The solution handles all edge cases, including when there are no '?' in the ticket.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given problem description.
