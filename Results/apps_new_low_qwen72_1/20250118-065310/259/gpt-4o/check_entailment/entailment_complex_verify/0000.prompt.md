You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of $n$ digits ($n$ is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. The number of digits that have been erased is even.

Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first $\frac{n}{2}$ digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last $\frac{n}{2}$ digits.

Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from $0$ to $9$. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.

If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains a string of $n$ digits and "?" characters — the ticket which Monocarp and Bicarp have found. If the $i$-th character is "?", then the $i$-th digit is erased. Note that there may be leading zeroes. The number of "?" characters is even.


-----Output-----

If Monocarp wins, print "Monocarp" (without quotes). Otherwise print "Bicarp" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0523

Output
Bicarp

Input
2
??

Output
Bicarp

Input
8
?054??0?

Output
Bicarp

Input
6
???00?

Output
Monocarp



-----Note-----

Since there is no question mark in the ticket in the first example, the winner is determined before the game even starts, and it is Bicarp.

In the second example, Bicarp also wins. After Monocarp chooses an erased digit and replaces it with a new one, Bicap can choose another position with an erased digit and replace it with the same digit, so the ticket is happy.

        if ticket[i] == '?':

The loop executes if `n > 2`, and does not execute if `n = 2` and both characters in `ticket` are non-'?'.
    diff = left_sum - right_sum

    if ((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0) :

    else :

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \) and must be at least 1, `i` is \( n - 1 \), `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first half of ticket, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of ticket, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the second half of ticket, `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of ticket, `diff` is \( left_sum - right_sum \), `q_diff` is \( left_question_marks - right_question_marks \). If \( (diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) \% 9 == 0 \), the condition is true. Otherwise, the condition is false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and `ticket` (a string of length `n` containing digits and an even number of '?' characters). It calculates the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' characters in the first and second halves of the `ticket` string (`left_sum` and `right_sum`, respectively) and the count of '?' characters in each half (`left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`). The function then determines whether the expression `(left_sum - right_sum + (left_question_marks - right_question_marks) // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` holds true. If it does, the function prints 'Bicarp'; otherwise, it prints 'Monocarp'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `n = 2` and both characters in `ticket` are non-'?', or when `ticket` contains only '?' characters. In these cases, the function still correctly evaluates the condition and prints the appropriate result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates whether Bicarp or Monocarp wins. Specifically, the condition `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` is used to determine the winner, but this does not accurately reflect the optimal play strategy for both players.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
4
?11?
```

Expected Output:
```
Bicarp
```

Actual Output:
```
Monocarp
```

In this example, the ticket has two question marks, one in the first half and one in the second half. The sums of the known digits are 1 for the first half and 1 for the second half. The difference `diff` is 0, and the difference in the number of question marks `q_diff` is 0. According to the program's logic, `(0 + 0 // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0`, which evaluates to `True`, leading to the output "Monocarp". However, Bicarp can always make the ticket happy by replacing the question marks with the same digit, ensuring a win. Therefore, the correct output should be "Bicarp".

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect determination of the winner.
