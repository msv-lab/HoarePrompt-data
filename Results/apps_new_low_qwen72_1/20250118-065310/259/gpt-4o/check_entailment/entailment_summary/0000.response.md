Reasoning:  
The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is designed to determine the winner of the game between Monocarp and Bicarp based on the initial state of the ticket and the optimal play strategy of both players. The key idea is to compare the sums of the digits in the first and second halves of the ticket and the distribution of the '?' characters.

1. **Sum Calculation and Question Mark Counting**: The function correctly calculates the sum of the known digits (`left_sum` and `right_sum`) and counts the number of '?' characters (`left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`) in the first and second halves of the ticket, respectively.

2. **Difference and Question Mark Difference**: The function computes the difference in the sums (`diff = left_sum - right_sum`) and the difference in the number of '?' characters (`q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks`).

3. **Winning Condition**: The function uses the condition `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` to determine the winner. This condition leverages the fact that the maximum impact of replacing a '?' with a digit (0-9) is 9. By ensuring that the total difference, adjusted by the potential maximum impact of the '?' characters, is divisible by 9, the function checks if Bicarp can force a happy ticket.

   - If the condition holds, Bicarp can always make the ticket happy by optimally placing the digits.
   - If the condition does not hold, Monocarp can prevent the ticket from being happy.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when `n = 2` and both characters are non-'?' or when the ticket contains only '?' characters. These cases are correctly evaluated by the condition, ensuring the correct output.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
