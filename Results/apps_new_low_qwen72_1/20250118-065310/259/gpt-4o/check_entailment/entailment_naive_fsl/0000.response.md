Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates whether Bicarp or Monocarp wins. Specifically, the condition `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` is used to determine the winner, but this does not accurately reflect the optimal play strategy for both players.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
4
?11?
```

Expected Output:
```
Bicarp
```

Actual Output:
```
Monocarp
```

In this example, the ticket has two question marks, one in the first half and one in the second half. The sums of the known digits are 1 for the first half and 1 for the second half. The difference `diff` is 0, and the difference in the number of question marks `q_diff` is 0. According to the program's logic, `(0 + 0 // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0`, which evaluates to `True`, leading to the output "Monocarp". However, Bicarp can always make the ticket happy by replacing the question marks with the same digit, ensuring a win. Therefore, the correct output should be "Bicarp".

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect determination of the winner.
