Reasoning:  
The program provided aims to solve the problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The solution involves three functions:

1. `func_1(x, y)`: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(x, y)`: Computes the LCM of \( x \) and \( y \) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. `func_3(a, b)`: Finds the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).

### Analysis of `func_3(a, b)`:
- If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, the smallest \( k \) is 0 because \( \text{LCM}(a, a) = a \).
- The difference between \( a \) and \( b \) is calculated as \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
- The program iterates over possible values of \( k \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) and checks if \( \text{diff} \) is divisible by \( k \). For each divisor \( k \), it considers both \( k \) and \( \text{diff} // k \) as candidates.
- For each candidate \( k \), it calculates \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) adjusted to be multiples of \( k \) (i.e., \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \)).
- It then computes the LCM of \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \) and updates the minimum LCM and corresponding \( k \) if the new LCM is smaller or equal but with a smaller \( k \).

### Edge Cases:
- When \( a = b \), the function correctly returns 0.
- The loop over \( k \) up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) ensures that all divisors of \( \text{diff} \) are considered, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Example Verification:
- For \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \):
  - \( \text{diff} = 4 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 2, 4
  - \( k = 2 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 8 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 12 \), and \( \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \), which is the smallest LCM.
- For \( a = 21 \) and \( b = 31 \):
  - \( \text{diff} = 10 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 2, 5, 10
  - \( k = 9 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 30 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 40 \), and \( \text{LCM}(30, 40) = 120 \), which is the smallest LCM.
- For \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 10 \):
  - \( \text{diff} = 5 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 5
  - \( k = 0 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 5 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 10 \), and \( \text{LCM}(5, 10) = 10 \), which is the smallest LCM.

Given the analysis and verification, the program appears to be correct.
