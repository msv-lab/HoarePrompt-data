### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a well-known and correct implementation.
   - The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is returned even if one of the inputs is zero.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
   - It correctly uses the GCD calculated by `func_1` to compute the LCM.
   - The function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if `func_1(x, y)` returns 0, but this is not a concern because `func_1` will always return a positive integer for positive inputs.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function aims to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized.
   - If `a` and `b` are equal, it correctly returns 0 immediately.
   - It calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`.
   - It iterates over all factors of `diff` up to the square root of `diff` to find the smallest `k` that minimizes the LCM.
   - For each factor `k`, it calculates the smallest multiples of `a` and `b` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It updates `min_lcm` and `min_k` if a smaller LCM is found or if the same LCM is found with a smaller `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized. Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the overall logic of `func_3` is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
