Reasoning:

1. **GCD Calculation (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD. This is a well-established and efficient method, and the annotations confirm that it works as intended.

2. **LCM Calculation (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the LCM using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \). The annotations indicate that this function works as expected, and it handles the case where the GCD is zero by raising a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is appropriate since the GCD of two positive integers is always positive.

3. **Finding the Optimal \( k \) (func_3)**:
   - The function `func_3` is designed to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.
   - The function first checks if \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, in which case the smallest \( k \) is 0. This is a correct optimization.
   - The function then iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \). This is an efficient approach because the divisors of \( d = |a - b| \) come in pairs, and checking up to the square root is sufficient to find all divisors.
   - For each candidate \( k \), it computes the new values \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) and their LCM. It updates the minimum LCM and the corresponding \( k \) if the current LCM is smaller or if it is equal but the current \( k \) is smaller. This ensures that the smallest \( k \) is chosen in case of ties.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( a \) and \( b \) are equal by returning 0 immediately, which is correct.
   - It also handles large values of \( a \) and \( b \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) efficiently by limiting the range of \( k \) to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

Given the detailed analysis and the confirmation from the annotations, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and efficiently. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
