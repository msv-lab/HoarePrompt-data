### Reasoning:

#### Function Breakdown:
1. **`func_1(x, y)`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
   - The loop continues until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD.
   - The function is correct and handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is zero.

2. **`func_2(x, y)`**:
   - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `x` and `y` using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
   - It uses `func_1(x, y)` to get the GCD and then performs the integer division.
   - The function is correct and handles the given constraints.

3. **`func_3(a, b)`**:
   - The function first checks if `a` and `b` are equal. If so, it returns 0 because the LCM of two equal numbers is the number itself.
   - It calculates the difference `diff` between `a` and `b`.
   - The function iterates over possible values of `k` from 1 to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) and checks if `diff` is divisible by `k`.
   - For each valid `k`, it considers both `k` and `diff // k` as candidates.
   - It calculates `new_a` and `new_b` as the smallest multiples of `k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It computes the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` and updates the minimum LCM and corresponding `k` if the new LCM is smaller or equal but with a smaller `k`.

#### Verification:
- **Example 1: \( a = 6 \), \( b = 10 \)**
  - \( \text{diff} = 4 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 2, 4
  - \( k = 2 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 8 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 12 \), and \( \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \), which is the smallest LCM.
- **Example 2: \( a = 21 \), \( b = 31 \)**
  - \( \text{diff} = 10 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 2, 5, 10
  - \( k = 9 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 30 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 40 \), and \( \text{LCM}(30, 40) = 120 \), which is the smallest LCM.
- **Example 3: \( a = 5 \), \( b = 10 \)**
  - \( \text{diff} = 5 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 5
  - \( k = 0 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 5 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 10 \), and \( \text{LCM}(5, 10) = 10 \), which is the smallest LCM.

#### Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal.
- The loop over \( k \) up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) ensures that all divisors of `diff` are considered, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It efficiently finds the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The examples provided and the edge cases are correctly handled.
