### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If multiple \( k \) values give the same LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be chosen.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is essential for calculating the LCM.
   - **func_2**: Computes the LCM of two numbers using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \). This function relies on `func_1`.
   - **func_3**: This is the main function that solves the problem. It checks if \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, returning 0 if they are. Otherwise, it iterates over the factors of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \) to find the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).

3. **Detailed Function 3 Analysis**:
   - **Initial Check**: If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, the LCM is already minimized (since \( \text{LCM}(a, a) = a \)), so \( k = 0 \) is returned.
   - **Difference Calculation**: The absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \) is calculated.
   - **Initialization**: `min_lcm` is initialized to infinity, and `min_k` is initialized to 0.
   - **Factor Iteration**: The function iterates over the factors of \( \text{diff} \) up to the square root of \( \text{diff} \). For each factor \( k \) and its corresponding pair \( \text{diff} // k \), it calculates the new values of \( a \) and \( b \) that are multiples of \( k \) and greater than or equal to \( a \) and \( b \), respectively.
   - **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of these new values is calculated using `func_2`.
   - **Minimization Check**: If the current LCM is smaller than the previously recorded minimum LCM, or if it is equal but the current \( k \) is smaller, the minimum LCM and \( k \) are updated.
   - **Return**: The function returns the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). The functions `func_1` and `func_2` provide the necessary tools for computing the GCD and LCM, and `func_3` effectively uses these tools to solve the problem as described.
