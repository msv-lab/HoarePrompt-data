 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers where at least one of them is not zero. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is returned even if one of the inputs is zero.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns the integer division of the product of `x` and `y` by the result of `func_1(x, y)`. If `func_1(x, y)` returns 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be raised.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` takes two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) and returns the smallest factor `min_k` that, when used to find the smallest multiples of `a` and `b` (denoted as `new_a` and `new_b`), results in the minimum least common multiple (LCM) of these multiples. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns 0 immediately. If no valid factors are found, the function also returns 0. The function ensures that `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `min_k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. The function considers all factors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` up to the square root of this difference.
