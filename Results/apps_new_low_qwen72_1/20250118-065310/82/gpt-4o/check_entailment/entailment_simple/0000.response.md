Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) that give the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be chosen.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **GCD and LCM Calculation:**
   - `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).

2. **Main Function (`func_3`):**
   - If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, the function immediately returns 0 because the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) is \( a \) itself, and adding 0 to both does not change the LCM.
   - The difference between \( a \) and \( b \) is calculated as `diff`.
   - The program initializes `min_lcm` to infinity and `min_k` to 0.
   - It iterates over all factors \( k \) of `diff` up to the square root of `diff`.
   - For each factor \( k \), it calculates the smallest multiples of \( k \) that are greater than or equal to \( a \) and \( b \) (denoted as `new_a` and `new_b`).
   - It computes the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` and updates `min_lcm` and `min_k` if a smaller LCM is found or if the LCM is the same but \( k \) is smaller.
   - Finally, it returns the smallest \( k \) that results in the minimum LCM.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When \( a = b \), the function correctly returns 0.
  - When \( a \) and \( b \) are different, the program correctly iterates over all factors of the difference and finds the optimal \( k \).

- **Algorithmic Correctness:**
  - The approach of iterating over factors of the difference and checking the LCM is efficient and correct.
  - The use of the GCD and LCM functions ensures that the calculations are accurate.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The constraints \( 1 \le a, b \le 10^9 \) are handled appropriately, and the program does not exceed these bounds.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
