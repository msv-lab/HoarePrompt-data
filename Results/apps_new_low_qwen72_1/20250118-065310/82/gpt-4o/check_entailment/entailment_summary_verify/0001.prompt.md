You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) and returns the smallest factor `min_k` that, when used to find the smallest multiples of `a` and `b` (denoted as `new_a` and `new_b`), results in the minimum least common multiple (LCM) of these multiples. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns 0 immediately. If no valid factors are found, the function also returns 0. The function ensures that `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `min_k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. The function considers all factors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` up to the square root of this difference.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The program provided aims to solve the problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The solution involves three functions:

1. `func_1(x, y)`: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(x, y)`: Computes the LCM of \( x \) and \( y \) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. `func_3(a, b)`: Finds the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).

### Analysis of `func_3(a, b)`:
- If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, the smallest \( k \) is 0 because \( \text{LCM}(a, a) = a \).
- The difference between \( a \) and \( b \) is calculated as \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
- The program iterates over possible values of \( k \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) and checks if \( \text{diff} \) is divisible by \( k \). For each divisor \( k \), it considers both \( k \) and \( \text{diff} // k \) as candidates.
- For each candidate \( k \), it calculates \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) adjusted to be multiples of \( k \) (i.e., \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \)).
- It then computes the LCM of \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \) and updates the minimum LCM and corresponding \( k \) if the new LCM is smaller or equal but with a smaller \( k \).

### Edge Cases:
- When \( a = b \), the function correctly returns 0.
- The loop over \( k \) up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) ensures that all divisors of \( \text{diff} \) are considered, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Example Verification:
- For \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \):
  - \( \text{diff} = 4 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 2, 4
  - \( k = 2 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 8 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 12 \), and \( \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \), which is the smallest LCM.
- For \( a = 21 \) and \( b = 31 \):
  - \( \text{diff} = 10 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 2, 5, 10
  - \( k = 9 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 30 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 40 \), and \( \text{LCM}(30, 40) = 120 \), which is the smallest LCM.
- For \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 10 \):
  - \( \text{diff} = 5 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 5
  - \( k = 0 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 5 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 10 \), and \( \text{LCM}(5, 10) = 10 \), which is the smallest LCM.
