You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:

    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

#Function 3:

    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) and returns the smallest factor `min_k` that, when used to find the smallest multiples of `a` and `b` (denoted as `new_a` and `new_b`), results in the minimum least common multiple (LCM) of these multiples. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns 0 immediately. If no valid factors are found, the function also returns 0. The function ensures that `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `min_k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. The function considers all factors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` up to the square root of this difference.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program appears to be correct:

1. **GCD Calculation (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a well-known and efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers.

2. **LCM Calculation (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \). This is a standard and correct way to compute the LCM.

3. **Finding the Optimal \( k \) (func_3)**:
   - The function `func_3` aims to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.
   - It first checks if \( a \) and \( b \) are already equal, in which case the smallest \( k \) is 0.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \). This is an efficient approach because the divisors of a number \( d \) (where \( d = |a - b| \)) come in pairs, and checking up to the square root is sufficient.
   - For each candidate \( k \), it computes the new values \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) and their LCM. It updates the minimum LCM and the corresponding \( k \) if the current LCM is smaller or if it is equal but the current \( k \) is smaller.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( a \) and \( b \) are equal by returning 0 immediately.
   - It also handles large values of \( a \) and \( b \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) efficiently by limiting the range of \( k \) to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and efficiently. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
