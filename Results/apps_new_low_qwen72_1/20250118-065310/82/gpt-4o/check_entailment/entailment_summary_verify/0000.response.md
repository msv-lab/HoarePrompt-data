### Reasoning:

1. **GCD Calculation (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This is a well-established and efficient method.

2. **LCM Calculation (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \). This is a standard and correct way to compute the LCM.

3. **Finding the Optimal \( k \) (func_3)**:
   - The function `func_3` aims to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.
   - It first checks if \( a \) and \( b \) are already equal, in which case the smallest \( k \) is 0. This is correct.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \). This is an efficient approach because the divisors of a number \( d \) (where \( d = |a - b| \)) come in pairs, and checking up to the square root is sufficient.
   - For each candidate \( k \), it computes the new values \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) and their LCM. It updates the minimum LCM and the corresponding \( k \) if the current LCM is smaller or if it is equal but the current \( k \) is smaller.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( a \) and \( b \) are equal by returning 0 immediately. This is correct.
   - It also handles large values of \( a \) and \( b \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) efficiently by limiting the range of \( k \) to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: \( a = 6 \), \( b = 10 \)
   - Expected Output: \( k = 2 \)
   - Calculation: \( \text{LCM}(6+2, 10+2) = \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \)
   - The program correctly finds \( k = 2 \).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: \( a = 21 \), \( b = 31 \)
   - Expected Output: \( k = 9 \)
   - Calculation: \( \text{LCM}(21+9, 31+9) = \text{LCM}(30, 40) = 120 \)
   - The program correctly finds \( k = 9 \).

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: \( a = 5 \), \( b = 10 \)
   - Expected Output: \( k = 0 \)
   - Calculation: \( \text{LCM}(5+0, 10+0) = \text{LCM}(5, 10) = 10 \)
   - The program correctly finds \( k = 0 \).

### Conclusion:

The program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and efficiently. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
