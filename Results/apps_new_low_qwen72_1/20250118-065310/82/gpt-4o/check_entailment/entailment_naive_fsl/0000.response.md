Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program appears to be correct:

1. **GCD Calculation (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a well-known and efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers.

2. **LCM Calculation (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \). This is a standard and correct way to compute the LCM.

3. **Finding the Optimal \( k \) (func_3)**:
   - The function `func_3` aims to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.
   - It first checks if \( a \) and \( b \) are already equal, in which case the smallest \( k \) is 0.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \). This is an efficient approach because the divisors of a number \( d \) (where \( d = |a - b| \)) come in pairs, and checking up to the square root is sufficient.
   - For each candidate \( k \), it computes the new values \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) and their LCM. It updates the minimum LCM and the corresponding \( k \) if the current LCM is smaller or if it is equal but the current \( k \) is smaller.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( a \) and \( b \) are equal by returning 0 immediately.
   - It also handles large values of \( a \) and \( b \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) efficiently by limiting the range of \( k \) to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and efficiently. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
