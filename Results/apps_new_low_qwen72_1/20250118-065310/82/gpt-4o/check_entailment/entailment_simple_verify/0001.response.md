### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(x, y)`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - The loop continues until \( y \) becomes 0, at which point \( x \) holds the GCD.
   - The state annotations confirm that the function returns the GCD of the original \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Function `func_2(x, y)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the least common multiple (LCM) of \( x \) and \( y \) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
   - The state annotations confirm that the function returns the integer division of the product of \( x \) and \( y \) by the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \).

3. **Function `func_3(a, b)`**:
   - **Initial Check**: If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, the function correctly returns 0 because the LCM of \( a \) and \( a \) is \( a \).
   - **Difference Calculation**: The difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \) is calculated.
   - **Loop Over Divisors**: The loop iterates over possible values of \( k \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \). For each \( k \), it checks if \( \text{diff} \) is divisible by \( k \). If so, it considers both \( k \) and \( \text{diff} // k \) as candidates.
   - **Adjusting \( a \) and \( b \)**: For each candidate \( k \), it calculates \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \) as the smallest multiples of \( k \) that are greater than or equal to \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - **LCM Calculation**: It computes the LCM of \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \) and updates the minimum LCM and corresponding \( k \) if the new LCM is smaller or equal but with a smaller \( k \).

### Edge Cases and Examples:
- **Example 1**: \( a = 6 \), \( b = 10 \)
  - \( \text{diff} = 4 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 2, 4
  - \( k = 2 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 8 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 12 \), and \( \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \), which is the smallest LCM.
- **Example 2**: \( a = 21 \), \( b = 31 \)
  - \( \text{diff} = 10 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 2, 5, 10
  - \( k = 9 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 30 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 40 \), and \( \text{LCM}(30, 40) = 120 \), which is the smallest LCM.
- **Example 3**: \( a = 5 \), \( b = 10 \)
  - \( \text{diff} = 5 \)
  - Possible \( k \) values: 1, 5
  - \( k = 0 \) gives \( \text{new\_a} = 5 \) and \( \text{new\_b} = 10 \), and \( \text{LCM}(5, 10) = 10 \), which is the smallest LCM.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases and examples provided.
- The logic and implementation are sound, ensuring that the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is found.
