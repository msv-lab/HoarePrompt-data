Reasoning: 

1. **GCD Calculation (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers. This is a well-established and reliable method.

2. **LCM Calculation (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the LCM using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \). This is mathematically sound and efficient.

3. **Finding the Optimal \( k \) (func_3)**:
   - The function `func_3` aims to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.
   - It correctly handles the case where \( a \) and \( b \) are already equal by returning 0 immediately.
   - The approach of iterating over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \) is efficient. This is because the divisors of a number \( d \) (where \( d = |a - b| \)) come in pairs, and checking up to the square root is sufficient to cover all divisors.
   - For each candidate \( k \), it computes the new values \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) and their LCM. It updates the minimum LCM and the corresponding \( k \) if the current LCM is smaller or if it is equal but the current \( k \) is smaller.
   - The logic ensures that the smallest \( k \) is chosen when multiple \( k \) values give the same minimum LCM.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( a \) and \( b \) are equal by returning 0.
   - It efficiently handles large values of \( a \) and \( b \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) by limiting the range of \( k \) to the square root of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and efficiently. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
