The provided code snippet updates the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` based on the current values of `current_lcm` and `candidate`. Given the initial state, the first line assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`, and the second line assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`.

Output State: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer, k is 2, new_a is the smallest even number greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest even number greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, min_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, min_k is candidate**
