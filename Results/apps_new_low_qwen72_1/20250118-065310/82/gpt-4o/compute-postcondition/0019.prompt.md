Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, and the current value of `diff % k` is 0
Code of the loop:
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
    new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
    current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
    if current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k:
        min_lcm = current_lcm
        min_k = candidate


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *a, b, and diff are positive integers. min_lcm is initially infinity, and min_k is 0. After the if-else block executes, if the current_lcm is less than min_lcm or if current_lcm equals min_lcm and candidate is less than min_k, then min_lcm is updated to the LCM of new_a and new_b, and min_k is updated to candidate. new_a remains the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to a, and new_b remains the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to b. current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b. If none of these conditions are met, the values of min_lcm, min_k, new_a, new_b, and current_lcm remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *a and b are positive integers, diff is a positive integer, new_a is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, candidate is diff // k. If current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k), then min_lcm is updated to the LCM of new_a and new_b, and min_k is updated to diff // k. Otherwise, min_lcm and min_k remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *a, b, and diff are positive integers. `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `(diff // k)` greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `(diff // k)` greater than or equal to `b`. `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `candidate` is `diff // k`. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
