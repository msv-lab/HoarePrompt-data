To address this task, let's analyze the provided code snippet and its effects on the initial state. The code updates the values of `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm`, and potentially updates `min_lcm` and `min_k` based on certain conditions.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `diff` is a positive integer.
- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `(diff // k)` greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `(diff // k)` greater than or equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.
- If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then:
  - `min_lcm` is updated to the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
  - `min_k` is updated to `diff // k`.
- Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Update `new_a`:**
   - The expression `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` ensures that `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - This is equivalent to rounding `a` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

2. **Update `new_b`:**
   - Similarly, `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` ensures that `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - This is equivalent to rounding `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

3. **Update `current_lcm`:**
   - `current_lcm` is updated to the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` using the function `func_2`.

### Final State:
- `new_a` is now the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is now the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of the new values of `new_a` and `new_b`.

The values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` are not explicitly updated in this code snippet. They will only be updated if the condition in the initial state is met, which is not part of the given code snippet.

### Output State:
**a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer, new_a is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, candidate is diff // k, min_lcm and min_k remain unchanged unless the condition in the initial state is met.**
