Output State: **After the loop finishes, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\). `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0. `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple (LCM) of any pair of numbers `new_a` and `new_b`, where `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of a factor `k` (or `diff // k`) that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. `min_k` is the factor `k` (or `diff // k`) that resulted in this minimum LCM. `new_a` and `new_b` are the last computed smallest multiples of their respective candidates greater than or equal to `a` and `b`. `current_lcm` is the last computed LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The loop iterates over all factors `k` of `diff` up to the square root of `diff`. If no valid factors are found, `min_lcm` remains infinity and `min_k` remains 0.**
