The only objects in the loop head are the variable `candidate` and the list `[k, diff // k]`. Therefore, we can only adjust `candidate`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `candidate` was the first element in the list `[k, diff // k]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `candidate` needs to be set to the next element in the list.

If the list has exactly two elements (as implied by the loop head), then `candidate` will be set to the second element, which is `diff // k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **a, b, and diff are positive integers. min_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b if the conditions were met, otherwise it remains as initially infinity. min_k is the candidate if the conditions were met, otherwise it remains 0. new_a remains the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to a, and new_b remains the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to b. current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b if the conditions were met, otherwise it remains unchanged. candidate is `diff // k`.**
