The provided code snippet updates the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` based on the current state of `current_lcm` and `candidate`. Here's the analysis:

- The first line assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`.
- The second line assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`.

Since `current_lcm` and `candidate` are already defined in the initial state, the final state will reflect these assignments directly.

Output State: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer, new_a is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, candidate is diff // k, min_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, min_k is diff // k**
