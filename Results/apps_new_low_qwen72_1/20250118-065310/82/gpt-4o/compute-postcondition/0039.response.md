To address the task, let's consider the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state. The code snippet modifies the values of `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` based on the value of `candidate`. The initial state provides some context about the variables, but the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `diff` are not specified beyond their ranges and constraints.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` is 3.
- `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of either 2 or `diff // 2` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of the last computed `new_a` and `new_b`.
- `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the pairs (`new_a`, `new_b`) calculated for candidates 2 and `diff // 2`.
- `min_k` is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM.
- `diff` must be at least 3 to ensure the loop can execute.

### Code Snippet:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Line 1: `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**
   - This line computes the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - For example, if `a` is 7 and `candidate` is 3, then `new_a` would be 9 because \( (7 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 9 \).

2. **Line 2: `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**
   - This line computes the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - For example, if `b` is 10 and `candidate` is 3, then `new_b` would be 12 because \( (10 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 12 \).

3. **Line 3: `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
   - This line computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b` using the function `func_2`.

### Final State:
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `new_a` and `new_b` are updated to the smallest multiples of `candidate` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.
- `current_lcm` is updated to the LCM of the new values of `new_a` and `new_b`.
- `k` remains 3.
- `diff` remains unchanged.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but they may be updated in subsequent logic that is not provided here.

### Output State:
**a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, k is 3, new_a is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, min_lcm is the minimum LCM of the pairs (new_a, new_b) calculated for candidates 2 and diff // 2, min_k is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM**
