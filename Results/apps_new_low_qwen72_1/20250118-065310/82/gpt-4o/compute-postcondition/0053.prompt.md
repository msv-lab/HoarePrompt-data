Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and a is not equal to b, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, min_lcm is infinity, min_k is 0
Code of the loop:
for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
    if diff % k == 0:
        for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
            new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
            new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
            current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
            if (current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and 
                candidate < min_k):
                min_lcm = current_lcm
                min_k = candidate


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 1. If `diff % k == 0`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of any pair of multiples of `k` and `diff // k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate (either `k` or `diff // k`) that resulted in this minimum LCM. `new_a` and `new_b` are the last computed smallest multiples of their respective candidates greater than or equal to `a` and `b`. `current_lcm` is the last computed LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The loop iterates exactly twice, once for `k` and once for `diff // k`. If `diff % k != 0`, then the values of `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `k` is 2. If `diff % k == 0`, `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of either 2 or `diff // 2` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. `current_lcm` is the LCM of the last computed `new_a` and `new_b`. `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the pairs (`new_a`, `new_b`) calculated for candidates 2 and `diff // 2`, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM. If `diff % k != 0`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their initial values.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of either 2 or `diff // 2` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively, `current_lcm` is the LCM of the last computed `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the pairs (`new_a`, `new_b`) calculated for candidates 2 and `diff // 2`, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM. If `diff % k == 0`, then `a` is 7, `b` is 11, `diff` is 15, `k` is 3, `new_a` is 10, `new_b` is 15, `current_lcm` is 30, `min_lcm` is 30, and `min_k` is 5.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
