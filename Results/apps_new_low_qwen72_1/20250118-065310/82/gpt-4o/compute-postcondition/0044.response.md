To solve this task, let's break down the provided code snippet and its effects on the variables, considering the initial state and the logic of the code.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a positive integer.
- `b` is a positive integer.
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` is 3.
- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
- If `current_lcm` < `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` == `min_lcm` and `candidate` < `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Calculate `new_a`**:
   - The expression `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` ensures that `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - This is equivalent to rounding `a` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

2. **Calculate `new_b`**:
   - Similarly, the expression `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` ensures that `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - This is equivalent to rounding `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

3. **Calculate `current_lcm`**:
   - `current_lcm` is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`, calculated using the function `func_2`.

### Final State:
- `a` remains a positive integer.
- `b` remains a positive integer.
- `diff` remains a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` remains 3.
- `new_a` is now the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is now the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.

### Example Calculation:
Assume `a = 7`, `b = 11`, `diff = 15`, `min_lcm = 100`, `min_k = 5`.

1. **Calculate `candidate`**:
   - `candidate = diff // k = 15 // 3 = 5`.

2. **Calculate `new_a`**:
   - `new_a = (7 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 11 // 5 * 5 = 10`.

3. **Calculate `new_b`**:
   - `new_b = (11 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 15 // 5 * 5 = 15`.

4. **Calculate `current_lcm`**:
   - `current_lcm = func_2(10, 15)`. Assuming `func_2` returns the LCM, `current_lcm = 30`.

5. **Update `min_lcm` and `min_k`**:
   - Since `current_lcm (30) < min_lcm (100)`, `min_lcm` is updated to 30 and `min_k` is updated to 5.

### Output State:
Output State: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, k is 3, new_a is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, candidate is diff // k, min_lcm is the updated minimum LCM if applicable, min_k is the updated minimum k if applicable**.

In the example provided:
Output State: **a is 7, b is 11, diff is 15, k is 3, new_a is 10, new_b is 15, current_lcm is 30, candidate is 5, min_lcm is 30, min_k is 5**.
