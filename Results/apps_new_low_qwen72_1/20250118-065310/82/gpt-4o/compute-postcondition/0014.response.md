Postcondition: ***a and b are positive integers, diff is a positive integer, new_a is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, candidate is diff // k. If current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k), then min_lcm is updated to the LCM of new_a and new_b, and min_k is updated to diff // k. Otherwise, min_lcm and min_k remain unchanged.***
