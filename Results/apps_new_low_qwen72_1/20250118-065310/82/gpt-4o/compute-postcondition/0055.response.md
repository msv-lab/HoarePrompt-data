The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the following:

- Case_1: If no valid factors are found, the function returns 0.
- Case_2: Otherwise, the function returns the factor `min_k` (or `diff // k`) that resulted in the minimum least common multiple (`min_lcm`) of any pair of numbers `new_a` and `new_b`, where `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `k` (or `diff // k`) that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns 0 if no valid factors are found. Otherwise, it returns the factor `min_k` that results in the minimum least common multiple of any pair of numbers `new_a` and `new_b`, which are the smallest multiples of `k` greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.**
