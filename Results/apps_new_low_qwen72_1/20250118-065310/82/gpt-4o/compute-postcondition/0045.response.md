The provided code snippet updates the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` based on the current values of `current_lcm` and `candidate`. Initially, `min_lcm` is set to the value of `current_lcm`, which is 30, and `min_k` is set to the value of `candidate`, which is 5. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **a is 7, b is 11, diff is 15, k is 3, new_a is 10, new_b is 15, current_lcm is 30, candidate is 5, min_lcm is 30, min_k is 5**
