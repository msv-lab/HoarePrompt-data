Postcondition: ***a and b are positive integers, diff is a positive integer, k is 2, new_a is the smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, min_lcm is unchanged, min_k is unchanged, candidate is 2. If current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k), then min_lcm is updated to the LCM of new_a and new_b, and min_k is updated to 2.***
