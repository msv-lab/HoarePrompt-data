Postcondition: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, k is 3, new_a is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, min_lcm is the minimum LCM of the pairs (new_a, new_b) calculated for candidates 2 and diff // 2, min_k is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`).**
