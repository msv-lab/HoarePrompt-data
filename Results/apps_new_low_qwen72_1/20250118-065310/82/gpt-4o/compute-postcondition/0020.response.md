Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 1. If `diff % k == 0`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of any pair of multiples of `k` and `diff // k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate (either `k` or `diff // k`) that resulted in this minimum LCM. `new_a` and `new_b` are the last computed smallest multiples of their respective candidates greater than or equal to `a` and `b`. `current_lcm` is the last computed LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The loop iterates exactly twice, once for `k` and once for `diff // k`. If `diff % k != 0`, then the values of `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged.***
