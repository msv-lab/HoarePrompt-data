Output State: **a and b are positive integers, diff is a positive integer, k is 2, new_a and new_b are the smallest multiples of either 2 or diff // 2 that are greater than or equal to a and b respectively, current_lcm is the LCM of the last computed new_a and new_b. min_lcm is the minimum LCM of the pairs (new_a, new_b) calculated for candidates 2 and diff // 2, and min_k is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM. If no updates occurred, min_lcm and min_k retain their initial values.**
