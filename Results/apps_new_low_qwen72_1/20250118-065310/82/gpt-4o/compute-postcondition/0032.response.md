To solve this task, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and determine the final state of the variables after executing the code. Let's break down the code and its effects:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers.
   - `diff` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // 2` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // 2` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` are unchanged.
   - `candidate` is `k`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
   new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
   current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
   ```

   - The first line calculates `new_a` as the smallest multiple of `candidate` (which is 2) that is greater than or equal to `a`. This is done using the formula `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
   - The second line calculates `new_b` similarly as the smallest multiple of `candidate` (which is 2) that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - The third line updates `current_lcm` to the LCM of the new values of `new_a` and `new_b` using a function `func_2`.

3. **Final State:**
   - `a` and `b` remain positive integers.
   - `diff` remains a positive integer.
   - `k` remains 2.
   - `new_a` is now the smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b` is now the smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - `current_lcm` is updated to the LCM of the new values of `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.
   - `candidate` remains 2.

Given the initial state and the transformations applied by the code, the final state can be described as follows:

Output State: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer, k is 2, new_a is the smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, min_lcm is unchanged, min_k is unchanged, candidate is 2**
