To analyze the given code block and provide the final output state, let's break down the effects of each line while considering the initial conditions:

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\)
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `min_lcm` is infinity
- `min_k` is 0
- `k` is 1
- `diff % k` is 0 (which means `diff` is divisible by `k`)

Code Block:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

### Analysis:

1. **First Line:**
   ```python
   new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
   ```
   This line rounds `a` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`. Let's denote `candidate` as `c` for simplicity. The expression `(a + c - 1) // c * c` effectively calculates the smallest multiple of `c` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

2. **Second Line:**
   ```python
   new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
   ```
   Similarly, this line rounds `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

3. **Third Line:**
   ```python
   current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
   ```
   This line calls a function `func_2` which is assumed to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`.

### Final Output State:

After executing the code block, the following variables are updated:
- `new_a` is set to the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is set to the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is set to the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

The initial state variables `diff`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, min_lcm is infinity, min_k is 0, k is 1, new_a is the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b**
