Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `k` is 2. If `diff % k == 0`, `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of either 2 or `diff // 2` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. `current_lcm` is the LCM of the last computed `new_a` and `new_b`. `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the pairs (`new_a`, `new_b`) calculated for candidates 2 and `diff // 2`, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM. If `diff % k != 0`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their initial values.***
