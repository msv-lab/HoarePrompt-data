Postcondition: ***a, b, and diff are positive integers. min_lcm is initially infinity, and min_k is 0. After the if-else block executes, if the current_lcm is less than min_lcm or if current_lcm equals min_lcm and candidate is less than min_k, then min_lcm is updated to the LCM of new_a and new_b, and min_k is updated to candidate. new_a remains the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to a, and new_b remains the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to b. current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b. If none of these conditions are met, the values of min_lcm, min_k, new_a, new_b, and current_lcm remain unchanged.***
