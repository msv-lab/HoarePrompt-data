Postcondition: ***a, b, and diff are positive integers. `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `(diff // k)` greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `(diff // k)` greater than or equal to `b`. `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `candidate` is `diff // k`. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
