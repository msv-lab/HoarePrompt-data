To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over a list `[k, diff // k]`.
   - The variables involved in this list are `k` and `diff`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the list `[k, diff // k]` is non-empty.
   - Since the list contains two elements (`k` and `diff // k`), the loop will always execute at least once.

3. **Check the Initial State:**
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged unless `diff % k == 0`.

4. **Ensure the List Elements are Valid:**
   - `k` is 2, which is a valid integer.
   - `diff // k` must be a valid integer, which means `diff` must be an integer and `k` must be a divisor of `diff`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the loop will execute if the list `[k, diff // k]` is non-empty. Since `k` is 2 and `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `diff // k` will always be a valid integer (even if it is 0, the list will still contain `k`).

Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once because the list `[k, diff // k]` is guaranteed to have at least one element, which is `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged unless `diff % k == 0`, the list `[k, diff // k]` contains at least one element, which is `k`.**
