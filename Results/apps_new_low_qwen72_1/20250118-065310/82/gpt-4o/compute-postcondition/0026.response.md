Postcondition: ***a, b, diff are positive integers, k is 2, new_a is the smallest even number greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest even number greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b. If current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k), then min_lcm is updated to the LCM of new_a and new_b, and min_k is updated to candidate. Otherwise, min_lcm and min_k remain unchanged.***
