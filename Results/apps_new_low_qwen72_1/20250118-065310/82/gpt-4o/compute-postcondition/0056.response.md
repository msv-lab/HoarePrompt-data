Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) and returns the smallest factor `min_k` that, when used to find the smallest multiples of `a` and `b` (denoted as `new_a` and `new_b`), results in the minimum least common multiple (LCM) of these multiples. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns 0 immediately. If no valid factors are found, the function also returns 0. The function ensures that `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `min_k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. The function considers all factors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` up to the square root of this difference. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Edge Case 1:** If `a` and `b` are equal, the function correctly returns 0.
- **Edge Case 2:** If `a` and `b` are very close (e.g., `a = 1` and `b = 2`), the function will still find the smallest factor and compute the LCM correctly.
- **Missing Logic:** The function does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are such that the absolute difference `diff` is 1. In this case, the only factor is 1, and the function should return 1 if it is the smallest valid factor. However, the function does not explicitly handle this scenario, but it will still work correctly because the loop will iterate over `k = 1`.
- **Edge Case 3:** If `a` and `b` are large numbers (close to \(10^9\)), the function will still compute the LCM and the smallest factor efficiently due to the use of the square root optimization in the loop.
- **Edge Case 4:** If `a` and `b` are prime numbers and their difference is a large prime number, the function will correctly identify the smallest factor and compute the LCM.

### Final State of the Program:
- **Parameters:** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within the range \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- **Return Value:** The function returns an integer `min_k` which is either 0 (if `a` equals `b` or no valid factors are found) or the smallest factor that results in the minimum LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

In summary, the function `func_3` is designed to find the smallest factor that minimizes the LCM of the smallest multiples of `a` and `b`, handling edge cases where `a` and `b` are equal or very close, and ensuring efficient computation even for large inputs.
