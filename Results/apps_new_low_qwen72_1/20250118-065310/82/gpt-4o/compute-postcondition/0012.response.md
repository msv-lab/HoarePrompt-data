To solve this task, we need to analyze the given code block and determine the final state based on the initial conditions and the operations performed. Let's break down the code and its effects:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a`, `b`, and `diff` are positive integers.
   - `min_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` if the conditions were met; otherwise, it remains as initially infinity.
   - `min_k` is the candidate if the conditions were met; otherwise, it remains 0.
   - `new_a` remains the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b` remains the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`.
   - `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` if the conditions were met; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - `candidate` is `diff // k`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
   new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
   current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first line calculates `new_a` as the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
     - Formula: `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
   - The second line calculates `new_b` as the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
     - Formula: `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
   - The third line calculates `current_lcm` as the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` using the function `func_2`.

4. **Final State:**
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are positive integers.
   - `diff` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer.
   - `min_lcm` remains as initially infinity unless updated elsewhere in the code.
   - `min_k` remains 0 unless updated elsewhere in the code.
   - `new_a` is now the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b` is now the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`.
   - `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `candidate` is `diff // k`.

Combining these changes into a single coherent final state:

Output State: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer, min_lcm is infinity, min_k is 0, new_a is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of (diff // k) greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, candidate is diff // k**
