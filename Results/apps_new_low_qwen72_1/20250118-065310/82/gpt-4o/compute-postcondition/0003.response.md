The first line calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and assigns it to `diff`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9 and are not equal, `diff` will be a positive integer greater than 0. The second line initializes `min_lcm` to infinity, which is a special floating-point value representing an infinitely large number. The third line initializes `min_k` to 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and a is not equal to b, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, min_lcm is infinity, min_k is 0**
