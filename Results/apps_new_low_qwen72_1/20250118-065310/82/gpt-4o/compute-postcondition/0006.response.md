To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given state and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\)
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `min_lcm` is infinity
- `min_k` is 0
- `k` is 1
- The current value of `diff % k` is 0

### Loop Head:
```python
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `candidate`, which is initialized from the list `[k, diff // k]`.
2. **Conditions for Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if the list `[k, diff // k]` contains at least one element.
   - Since `k` is 1 and `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `diff // k` (which is `diff // 1`) will also be a positive integer.
   - Therefore, the list `[k, diff // k]` will always contain at least two elements: 1 and `diff`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `k` is 1
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0
- The list `[k, diff // k]` contains at least one element, which it does since `k` is 1 and `diff` is positive.

Thus, the state can be described as:
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, and the current value of `diff % k` is 0**
