Postcondition: ***a is 7, b is 11, diff is 15, k is 3, new_a is 10, new_b is 15, current_lcm is 30, candidate is 5, min_lcm is 30, min_k is 5. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then the values of the variables remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.***
