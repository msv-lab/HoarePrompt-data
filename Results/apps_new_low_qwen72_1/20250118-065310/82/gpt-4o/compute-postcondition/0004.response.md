To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will start its first iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `k` and the expression `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range generated by `range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1)` contains at least one element. This means that the upper bound of the range, `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, must be greater than the lower bound, which is 1.

### Conditions:
- `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1 > 1`
- Simplifying this, we get: `int(math.sqrt(diff)) >= 1`
- This implies that `math.sqrt(diff) >= 1`
- Squaring both sides, we get: `diff >= 1`

Given that `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, this condition is already satisfied.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `min_lcm` is infinity.
- `min_k` is 0.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `diff` must be at least 1, which is already given. The initial value of `k` will be 1.

### Final State:
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1**
