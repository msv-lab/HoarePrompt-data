Output State: **The program returns the factor `min_k` (or `diff // k`) that resulted in the minimum least common multiple (`min_lcm`) of any pair of numbers `new_a` and `new_b`, where `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `k` (or `diff // k`) that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. If no valid factors are found, `min_k` remains 0.**
