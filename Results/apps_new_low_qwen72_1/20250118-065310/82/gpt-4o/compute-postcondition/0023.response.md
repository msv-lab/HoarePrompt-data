To solve this problem, let's break down the code and understand its overall effect on the variables given in the initial state.

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\)
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `k` is 2
- `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged unless `diff % k == 0`
- The list `[k, diff // k]` contains at least one element, which is `k`.

Code Snippet:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding `candidate`**:
   - The variable `candidate` is not explicitly defined in the provided code. However, based on the context, it seems that `candidate` should be `k` (which is 2). This assumption is supported by the condition that the list `[k, diff // k]` contains at least one element, which is `k`.

2. **Calculating `new_a` and `new_b`**:
   - `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
     - This formula rounds `a` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`. Since `candidate` is 2, `new_a` will be the smallest even number greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
     - Similarly, `new_b` will be the smallest even number greater than or equal to `b`.

3. **Calculating `current_lcm`**:
   - `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`
     - The function `func_2` is assumed to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`.

### Final State:

- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `diff` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains 2.
- `new_a` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can express the final state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer, k is 2, new_a is the smallest even number greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest even number greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b**.
