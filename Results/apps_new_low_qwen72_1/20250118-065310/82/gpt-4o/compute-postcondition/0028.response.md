The provided code snippet updates the values of `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` based on the given initial state and the logic within the code. Let's break down the final state after executing the entire block of code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a`, `b`, `diff` are positive integers.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `new_a` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `b`.
   - `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on certain conditions.
   - `candidate` is `diff // k`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
     - This line calculates the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
     - Since `candidate` is `diff // k`, and `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // 2`.
     - Therefore, `new_a` becomes the smallest multiple of `diff // 2` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

   - `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
     - This line calculates the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
     - Similarly, `new_b` becomes the smallest multiple of `diff // 2` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

   - `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`
     - This line calculates the LCM of the new values of `new_a` and `new_b` using the function `func_2`.

3. **Final State:**
   - `a` remains a positive integer.
   - `b` remains a positive integer.
   - `diff` remains a positive integer.
   - `k` remains 2.
   - `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // 2` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // 2` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - `current_lcm` is the LCM of the new values of `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged unless updated by other parts of the program not shown here.
   - `candidate` is `diff // 2`.

Output State: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer, k is 2, new_a is the smallest multiple of diff // 2 that is greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of diff // 2 that is greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, min_lcm and min_k are unchanged, candidate is diff // 2**
