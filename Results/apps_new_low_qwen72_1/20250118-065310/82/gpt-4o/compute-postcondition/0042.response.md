Postcondition: ***a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, k is 3, new_a is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b. If current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k), then min_lcm is updated to current_lcm and min_k is updated to candidate. Otherwise, min_lcm and min_k remain unchanged.***
