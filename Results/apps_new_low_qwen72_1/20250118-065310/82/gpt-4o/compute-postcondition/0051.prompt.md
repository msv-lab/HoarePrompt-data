Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of either 2 or `diff // 2` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively, `current_lcm` is the LCM of the last computed `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the pairs (`new_a`, `new_b`) calculated for candidates 2 and `diff // 2`, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM.
Code of the loop:
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
    new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
    current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
    if current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k:
        min_lcm = current_lcm
        min_k = candidate


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, k is 3, new_a is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of candidate that is greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b. If current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k), then min_lcm is updated to current_lcm and min_k is updated to candidate. Otherwise, min_lcm and min_k remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *a is 7, b is 11, diff is 15, k is 3, new_a is 10, new_b is 15, current_lcm is 30, candidate is 5, min_lcm is 30, min_k is 5. If `current_lcm` < `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` == `min_lcm` and `candidate` < `min_k`), the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and `candidate` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *a is 7, b is 11, diff is 15, k is 3, new_a is 10, new_b is 15, current_lcm is 30, candidate is 5, min_lcm is 30, min_k is 5. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then the values of the variables remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
