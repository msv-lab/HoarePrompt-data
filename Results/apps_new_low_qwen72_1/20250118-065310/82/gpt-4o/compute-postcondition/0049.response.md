The provided code snippet assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm` and the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. Given the initial state, `current_lcm` is 30 and `candidate` is 5, these values are directly used for the assignments. No other variables are modified by the code.

Output State: **a is 7, b is 11, diff is 15, k is 3, new_a is 10, new_b is 15, current_lcm is 30, candidate is 5, min_lcm is 30, min_k is 5**
