To solve this task, we need to evaluate the expressions for `new_a` and `new_b` using the given initial state, and then compute the `current_lcm` using a hypothetical function `func_2`. Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is 7
   - `b` is 11
   - `diff` is 15
   - `k` is 3
   - `new_a` is 10
   - `new_b` is 15
   - `current_lcm` is 30
   - `candidate` is 5
   - `min_lcm` is 30
   - `min_k` is 5

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
     - `a` is 7, `candidate` is 5
     - Calculation: `(7 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 11 // 5 * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10`
     - New value of `new_a` is 10

   - `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
     - `b` is 11, `candidate` is 5
     - Calculation: `(11 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 15 // 5 * 5 = 3 * 5 = 15`
     - New value of `new_b` is 15

   - `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`
     - Assuming `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, and given `new_a` is 10 and `new_b` is 15, the LCM of 10 and 15 is 30.
     - New value of `current_lcm` is 30

3. **Final State:**
   - `a` is 7
   - `b` is 11
   - `diff` is 15
   - `k` is 3
   - `new_a` is 10
   - `new_b` is 15
   - `current_lcm` is 30
   - `candidate` is 5
   - `min_lcm` is 30
   - `min_k` is 5

Output State: **a is 7, b is 11, diff is 15, k is 3, new_a is 10, new_b is 15, current_lcm is 30, candidate is 5, min_lcm is 30, min_k is 5**
