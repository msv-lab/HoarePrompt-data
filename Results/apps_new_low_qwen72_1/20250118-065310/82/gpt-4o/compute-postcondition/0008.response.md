Postcondition: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer greater than 0, min_lcm is infinity, min_k is 0, k is 1, new_a is the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest multiple of candidate greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b, and either (current_lcm is less than min_lcm) or (current_lcm is equal to min_lcm and candidate is less than min_k)**
