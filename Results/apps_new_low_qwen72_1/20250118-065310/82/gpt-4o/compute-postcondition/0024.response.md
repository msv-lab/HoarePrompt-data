Postcondition: **a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, diff is a positive integer, k is 2, new_a is the smallest even number greater than or equal to a, new_b is the smallest even number greater than or equal to b, current_lcm is the LCM of new_a and new_b. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`).**
