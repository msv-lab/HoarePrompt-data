Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of either 2 or `diff // 2` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively, `current_lcm` is the LCM of the last computed `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the pairs (`new_a`, `new_b`) calculated for candidates 2 and `diff // 2`, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate value that resulted in this minimum LCM. If `diff % k == 0`, then `a` is 7, `b` is 11, `diff` is 15, `k` is 3, `new_a` is 10, `new_b` is 15, `current_lcm` is 30, `min_lcm` is 30, and `min_k` is 5.***
