    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original `x` and `y`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers where at least one of them is not zero. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is returned even if one of the inputs is zero.

def func_2(x, y):

    #The program returns the integer division of the product of x and y by the result of func_1(x, y), where x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns the integer division of the product of `x` and `y` by the result of `func_1(x, y)`. If `func_1(x, y)` returns 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be raised.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\). `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0. `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple (LCM) of any pair of numbers `new_a` and `new_b`, where `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of a factor `k` (or `diff // k`) that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. `min_k` is the factor `k` (or `diff // k`) that resulted in this minimum LCM. `new_a` and `new_b` are the last computed smallest multiples of their respective candidates greater than or equal to `a` and `b`. `current_lcm` is the last computed LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The loop iterates over all factors `k` of `diff` up to the square root of `diff`. If no valid factors are found, `min_lcm` remains infinity and `min_k` remains 0.
    return min_k
    #The program returns the factor `min_k` (or `diff // k`) that resulted in the minimum least common multiple (`min_lcm`) of any pair of numbers `new_a` and `new_b`, where `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `k` (or `diff // k`) that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. If no valid factors are found, `min_k` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) and returns the smallest factor `min_k` that, when used to find the smallest multiples of `a` and `b` (denoted as `new_a` and `new_b`), results in the minimum least common multiple (LCM) of these multiples. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns 0 immediately. If no valid factors are found, the function also returns 0. The function ensures that `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `min_k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. The function considers all factors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` up to the square root of this difference.
