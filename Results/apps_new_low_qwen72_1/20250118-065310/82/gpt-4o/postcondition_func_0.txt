The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers where at least one of them is not zero. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is returned even if one of the inputs is zero.
