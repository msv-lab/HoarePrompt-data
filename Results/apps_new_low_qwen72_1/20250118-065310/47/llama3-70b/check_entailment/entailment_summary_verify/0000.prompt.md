You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
After finishing eating her bun, Alyona came up with two integers n and m. She decided to write down two columns of integers — the first column containing integers from 1 to n and the second containing integers from 1 to m. Now the girl wants to count how many pairs of integers she can choose, one from the first column and the other from the second column, such that their sum is divisible by 5.

Formally, Alyona wants to count the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and $(x + y) \operatorname{mod} 5$ equals 0.

As usual, Alyona has some troubles and asks you to help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and (x + y) is divisible by 5.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 12

Output
14

Input
11 14

Output
31

Input
1 5

Output
1

Input
3 8

Output
5

Input
5 7

Output
7

Input
21 21

Output
88



-----Note-----

Following pairs are suitable in the first sample case:   for x = 1 fits y equal to 4 or 9;  for x = 2 fits y equal to 3 or 8;  for x = 3 fits y equal to 2, 7 or 12;  for x = 4 fits y equal to 1, 6 or 11;  for x = 5 fits y equal to 5 or 10;  for x = 6 fits y equal to 4 or 9. 

Only the pair (1, 4) is suitable in the third sample case.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where both `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 1,000,000. It then counts the number of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` is in the range [1, n] and `y` is in the range [1, m], such that the sum `(x + y)` is divisible by 5. Finally, the function prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem by iterating through all possible pairs `(x, y)` and checking if their sum is divisible by 5. This approach is inefficient and will not perform well for large values of `n` and `m` (up to 1,000,000). The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times m)\), which is impractical for the given constraints.

A more efficient approach would involve calculating the number of valid pairs directly using mathematical properties. For each `x` in the range `[1, n]`, we need to find the corresponding `y` values in the range `[1, m]` such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`. This can be done by precomputing the counts of numbers in each residue class modulo 5 for both `n` and `m`.

Here is a more efficient solution:
```python
def count_pairs(n, m):
    # Calculate the number of elements in each residue class modulo 5
    n_residues = [0] * 5
    m_residues = [0] * 5

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        n_residues[i % 5] += 1

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        m_residues[i % 5] += 1

    # Count the pairs (x, y) such that (x + y) % 5 == 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(5):
        count += n_residues[i] * m_residues[(5 - i) % 5]

    return count

# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
print(count_pairs(n, m))
```

This solution has a time complexity of \(O(n + m)\), which is much more efficient for the given constraints. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to its inefficiency and potential to fail for large inputs.
