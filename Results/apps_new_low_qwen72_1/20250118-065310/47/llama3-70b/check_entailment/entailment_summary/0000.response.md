Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, iterates over all possible pairs `(x, y)` where `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ y ≤ m`, and counts the pairs where `(x + y) % 5 == 0`. The final count is then printed. This approach ensures that all pairs are considered, and the condition for divisibility by 5 is checked accurately.

However, the program uses a brute-force approach with nested loops, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \times m)\). Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000), this approach could be inefficient and may not run within a reasonable time for large values of `n` and `m`.

Despite the inefficiency, the program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem. The inefficiency is a performance issue rather than a correctness issue.

Correctness: **True**
