Reasoning:

1. The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which are within the specified range (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000).
2. It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
3. It iterates over all possible pairs `(x, y)` where `x` ranges from 1 to `n` and `y` ranges from 1 to `m`.
4. For each pair, it checks if `(x + y) % 5 == 0`. If this condition is true, it increments the `count`.
5. After the loops complete, it prints the value of `count`, which represents the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`.

The logic of the program is correct and follows the problem statement accurately. The nested loops ensure that all pairs are considered, and the condition `(x + y) % 5 == 0` correctly identifies the pairs that meet the criteria.

Correctness: **True**
