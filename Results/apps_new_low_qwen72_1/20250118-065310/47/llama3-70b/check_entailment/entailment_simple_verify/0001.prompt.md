You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
After finishing eating her bun, Alyona came up with two integers n and m. She decided to write down two columns of integers — the first column containing integers from 1 to n and the second containing integers from 1 to m. Now the girl wants to count how many pairs of integers she can choose, one from the first column and the other from the second column, such that their sum is divisible by 5.

Formally, Alyona wants to count the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and $(x + y) \operatorname{mod} 5$ equals 0.

As usual, Alyona has some troubles and asks you to help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and (x + y) is divisible by 5.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 12

Output
14

Input
11 14

5

Input
5 7

Output
7

Input
21 21

Output
88



-----Note-----

Following pairs are suitable in the first sample case:   for x = 1 fits y equal to 4 or 9;  for x = 2 fits y equal to 3 or 8;  for x = 3 fits y equal to 2, 7 or 12;  for x = 4 fits y equal to 1, 6 or 11;  for x = 5 fits y equal to 5 or 10;  for x = 6 fits y equal to 4 or 9. 

Only the pair (1, 4) is suitable in the third sample case.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer read from input, `m` is the second integer read from input, `count` is the total number of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` is in the range [1, n] and `y` is in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`.
    print(count)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through all possible pairs (x, y) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\), and counts the pairs where the sum of x and y is divisible by 5. While the logic is conceptually correct, the implementation is inefficient due to its time complexity of \(O(n \times m)\). Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000), this approach will likely time out for large inputs.

A more efficient solution would involve mathematical insights to reduce the number of operations. For example, for each \(x\), we can directly calculate the number of valid \(y\) values without iterating through all possible \(y\) values. This can be done by considering the remainders when \(x\) and \(y\) are divided by 5.

However, the question specifically asks for correctness based on the provided problem description and valid inputs. The program does produce the correct output for the given examples, but it is not optimal.

Correctness: **True** (but inefficient for large inputs)
