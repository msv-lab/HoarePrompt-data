Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `y` is `k + 1`. If `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, then `count` is 1 if it was initially 0, or 2 if it was initially 1, and the sum of `x` and `(k + 1)` is divisible by 5. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and the sum of `x` and `(k + 1)` is not divisible by 5.***
