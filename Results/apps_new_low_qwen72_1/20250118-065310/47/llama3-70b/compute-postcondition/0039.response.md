It seems there's a missing part in your request where the actual parameters and the output logic of the `func()` should be described. However, based on the provided constraints, I will assume the function takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 1,000,000.

Given the constraints and without additional specific output logic provided, I'll make a reasonable assumption about the output based on common operations with such parameters (for example, a mathematical operation like calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) or the least common multiple (LCM), though these are just assumptions).

### Example Assumption:
Output: The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m`.

### Functionality Description:
The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 1,000,000. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both positive integers within the range 1 to 1,000,000, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m`.**

If you have a specific output logic in mind, please provide it, and I can adjust the description accordingly.
