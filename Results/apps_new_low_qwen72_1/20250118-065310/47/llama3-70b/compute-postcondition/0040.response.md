Functionality: ** The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where both `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 1,000,000. It then counts the number of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` is in the range [1, n] and `y` is in the range [1, m], such that the sum `(x + y)` is divisible by 5. Finally, the function prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, values outside the specified range).
- The function does not return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m` as mentioned in the overall postcondition; instead, it prints the count of valid pairs.
- If `n` or `m` is 0 or negative, the function will not behave as expected because the ranges will be invalid.
- The function assumes that the input is always provided in the correct format (two integers separated by a space). If the input format is incorrect, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
