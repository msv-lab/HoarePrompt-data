The only variables in the loop head are `y` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` being less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must increment by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be at least 2 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` must be at least 2, `x` is 2, `y` is 2. If `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, then `count` is the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0` plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`.**
