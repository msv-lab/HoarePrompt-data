Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 1. If `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, then `count` is the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0` plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`.***
