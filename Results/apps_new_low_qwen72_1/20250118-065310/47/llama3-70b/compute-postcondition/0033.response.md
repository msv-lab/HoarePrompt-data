The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` being less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 2 and `m` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `m` must still be at least 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is 2, `y` is 3. If `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`.**
