To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is the first integer read from input.
- `m` is the second integer read from input.
- `count` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop uses the `range(1, n + 1)` function, which generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n + 1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one element.
3. The range `range(1, n + 1)` will contain at least one element if `n + 1` is greater than 1. This simplifies to `n > 0`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`m` and `count`) do not affect the loop's execution directly.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from input, `count` is 0**
