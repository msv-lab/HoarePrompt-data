To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given state and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer read from input
- `count` is the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`
- `x` is the next integer in the range [1, n] (i.e., `x` is incremented by 1)

### Loop Statement:
```python
for y in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `y` and the value of `m`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, m + 1)` is non-empty. This means that `m` must be at least 1.
3. **Initial Values**:
   - `y` will start at 1.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The other variables (`n`, `count`, `x`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they are part of the overall state.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `y` will start at 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `count` is the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, `x` is the next integer in the range [1, n], `y` is 1**
