To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is the second integer read from input.
- `x` is 2.
- `count` is the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for y in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `y` and the upper limit `m + 1`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if there is at least one value for `y` in the range `1` to `m` (inclusive).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. This is because `range(1, m + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `m` inclusive.
- The initial state of `y` when the loop starts is 1.
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `count` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they are part of the initial state.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `m` must be at least 1, and `y` will be 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `x` is 2, `count` is the number of integers `y` in the range [1, m] such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, `y` is 1**
