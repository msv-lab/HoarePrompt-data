Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`, and `y` is `k + 2`. If `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, then the sum of `x` and `(k + 2)` is divisible by 5, and `count` is updated to 1 if it was initially 0, or to 2 if it was initially 1. Otherwise, the sum of `x` and `(k + 2)` is not divisible by 5, and `count` remains 0.***
