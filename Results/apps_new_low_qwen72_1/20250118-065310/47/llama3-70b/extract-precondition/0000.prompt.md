You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: After finishing eating her bun, Alyona came up with two integers n and m. She decided to write down two columns of integers — the first column containing integers from 1 to n and the second containing integers from 1 to m. Now the girl wants to count how many pairs of integers she can choose, one from the first column and the other from the second column, such that their sum is divisible by 5.

Formally, Alyona wants to count the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and $(x + y) \operatorname{mod} 5$ equals 0.

As usual, Alyona has some troubles and asks you to help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and (x + y) is divisible by 5.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 12

Output
14

Input
11 14

5

Input
5 7

Output
7

Input
21 21

Output
88



-----Note-----

Following pairs are suitable in the first sample case:   for x = 1 fits y equal to 4 or 9;  for x = 2 fits y equal to 3 or 8;  for x = 3 fits y equal to 2, 7 or 12;  for x = 4 fits y equal to 1, 6 or 11;  for x = 5 fits y equal to 5 or 10;  for x = 6 fits y equal to 4 or 9. 

Only the pair (1, 4) is suitable in the third sample case.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
