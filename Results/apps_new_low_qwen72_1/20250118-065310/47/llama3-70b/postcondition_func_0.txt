The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where both `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 1,000,000. It then counts the number of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` is in the range [1, n] and `y` is in the range [1, m], such that the sum `(x + y)` is divisible by 5. Finally, the function prints the count of such pairs. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
