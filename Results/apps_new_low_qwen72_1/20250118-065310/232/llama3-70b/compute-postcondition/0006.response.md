The function `func` is described without any explicit parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is clear that the function should logically accept two parameters, `n` and `a`. 

- `n` is an even integer with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `a` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ a ≤ n.

Since the output section is empty, we cannot determine the exact return value from the information provided. However, we can infer that the function is designed to operate with these parameters and likely returns some value or performs some operation based on them.

To summarize, the function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`, and the expected return value is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`, where `n` is an even integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ n). The return value is not specified.**
