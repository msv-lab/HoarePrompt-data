The code snippet `print(a // 2 + a % 2)` calculates the integer division of `a` by 2 (`a // 2`) and adds the remainder of `a` divided by 2 (`a % 2`). This effectively rounds up `a / 2` to the nearest whole number. Since `a` is an integer and the current value of `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, the result of this operation will be printed, but the variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer input by the user where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and the current value of `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. The value `a // 2 + a % 2` is printed.**
