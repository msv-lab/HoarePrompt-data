Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `n` and `a`, from user input, where `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100,000] and `a` is an integer in the range [1, n]. It then prints a calculated value based on the following conditions: if `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, it prints `a // 2 + a % 2`; otherwise, it prints `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed value, which is a positive integer representing the result of the specified calculation. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes valid input (i.e., `n` is an even integer within the specified range, and `a` is within the range [1, n]). If the input is invalid, the function's behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where the input values are outside the specified ranges or where the input format is incorrect (e.g., non-integer values or fewer/more than two values).
- The function does not return a value, so any further processing would need to rely on the printed output.
