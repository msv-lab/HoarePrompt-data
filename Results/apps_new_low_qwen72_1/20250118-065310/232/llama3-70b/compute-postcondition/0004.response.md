The code calculates and prints the result of the expression \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2\). Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - \( n - a + 1 \) is computed first.
   - This result is then divided by 2 using integer division (`//`), which gives the quotient.
   - The remainder of this division is obtained using the modulus operator (`%`).
   - The sum of the quotient and the remainder is then printed.

2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
   - No new variables are introduced.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Given that `a` is greater than `n // 2`, \( n - a + 1 \) will be a positive integer.
   - For any positive integer \( k \), \( k // 2 + k % 2 \) will always be equal to \( k \) if \( k \) is odd, and \( k // 2 \) if \( k \) is even.

4. **Specific Values**:
   - Since \( n - a + 1 \) is a positive integer, let's denote it as \( k \).
   - \( k = n - a + 1 \).
   - The expression simplifies to \( k // 2 + k % 2 \).

5. **Result**:
   - If \( k \) is odd, \( k // 2 + k % 2 = k \).
   - If \( k \) is even, \( k // 2 + k % 2 = k // 2 \).

Given the constraints:
- \( n \) is an even integer.
- \( a \) is greater than \( n // 2 \).

Let's consider the possible values:
- If \( a \) is just slightly greater than \( n // 2 \), \( n - a + 1 \) will be a small positive integer.
- For example, if \( a = n // 2 + 1 \), then \( n - a + 1 = n - (n // 2 + 1) + 1 = n - n // 2 \).

Since \( n \) is even, \( n // 2 \) is also an integer, and \( n - n // 2 \) will be \( n // 2 \), which is an integer.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
- \( k = n - a + 1 \).
- The result of the expression \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2 \) will be \( n - a + 1 \) if \( n - a + 1 \) is odd, or \( (n - a + 1) // 2 \) if \( n - a + 1 \) is even.

Since \( n - a + 1 \) is a positive integer, the result will always be a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer input by the user where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and `a` is greater than `n // 2`, the result of the expression is printed as a positive integer.**
