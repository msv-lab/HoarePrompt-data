The values of `n` and `a` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `a` respectively. The new values of `n` and `a` are determined by the user's input, but they must still satisfy the conditions that `n` is an even integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ a ≤ n.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer input by the user where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ a ≤ n**
