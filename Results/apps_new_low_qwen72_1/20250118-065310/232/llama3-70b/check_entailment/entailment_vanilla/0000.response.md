Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it accurately calculates the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house `a` based on the problem description. Let's break down the logic:

1. **House Numbering and Opposite Houses:**
   - Odd-numbered houses are on one side of the street, starting from 1 up to \( n-1 \).
   - Even-numbered houses are on the other side of the street, starting from \( n \) down to 2.
   - House \( 1 \) is opposite house \( n \), house \( 3 \) is opposite house \( n-2 \), and so on.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To reach house \( a \), Vasya can either drive to the house directly or to its opposite house, whichever is closer.
   - For odd-numbered houses \( a \leq n/2 \), the time to reach house \( a \) is \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \).
   - For even-numbered houses \( a > n/2 \), the time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) is \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \).

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
```

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The program correctly parses the input values \( n \) and \( a \).

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if a <= n // 2:` checks if the house number \( a \) is less than or equal to half of the total number of houses.
  - If true, it calculates the time to reach house \( a \) using `a // 2 + a % 2`.
  - If false, it calculates the time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) using `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the calculated time.

The logic in the program matches the problem description and handles both cases (odd and even house numbers) correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
