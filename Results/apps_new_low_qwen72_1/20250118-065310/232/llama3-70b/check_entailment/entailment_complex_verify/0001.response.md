Reasoning: 

To verify the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic step by step and compare it with the problem description:

1. **House Numbering and Opposite Houses:**
   - Odd-numbered houses are on one side of the street, starting from 1 up to \( n-1 \).
   - Even-numbered houses are on the other side of the street, starting from \( n \) down to 2.
   - House 1 is opposite house \( n \), house 3 is opposite house \( n-2 \), and so on.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To reach house \( a \), Vasya can either drive to the house directly or to its opposite house, whichever is closer.
   - For odd-numbered houses \( a \leq n/2 \), the time to reach house \( a \) is \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \).
   - For even-numbered houses \( a > n/2 \), the time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) is \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \).

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
```

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The program correctly parses the input values \( n \) and \( a \).

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if a <= n // 2:` checks if the house number \( a \) is less than or equal to half of the total number of houses.
  - If true, it calculates the time to reach house \( a \) using `a // 2 + a % 2`.
  - If false, it calculates the time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) using `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the calculated time.

Let's verify the correctness with some examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 2`
  - \( n = 4 \), \( a = 2 \)
  - Since \( 2 \leq 4 // 2 \), the program calculates \( 2 // 2 + 2 \% 2 = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (which is incorrect, should be 2).
  - Correct output: `2`

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `8 5`
  - \( n = 8 \), \( a = 5 \)
  - Since \( 5 > 8 // 2 \), the program calculates \( (8 - 5 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 5 + 1) \% 2 = 4 // 2 + 4 \% 2 = 2 + 0 = 2 \) (which is incorrect, should be 3).
  - Correct output: `3`

Upon re-evaluation, it appears that the original assessment is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the time calculation for both cases. Specifically, the time calculation for even-numbered houses and the opposite house is off by 1 in some cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
