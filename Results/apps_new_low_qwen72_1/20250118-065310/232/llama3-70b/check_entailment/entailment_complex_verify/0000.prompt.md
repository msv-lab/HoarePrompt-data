You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The main street of Berland is a straight line with n houses built along it (n is an even number). The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2, house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on.

Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a. To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n, he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.

Your task is: find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house a.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers, n and a (1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of houses on the street and the number of the house that Vasya needs to reach, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that number n is even.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum time Vasya needs to get from the beginning of the street to house a.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
8 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample there are only four houses on the street, two houses at each side. House 2 will be the last at Vasya's right.

The second sample corresponds to picture with n = 8. House 5 is the one before last at Vasya's left.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and a is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n.
def func():
    n, a = map(int, input().split())
    if (a <= n // 2) :
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else :
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer input by the user where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ a ≤ n. If `a` ≤ `n // 2`, the value `a // 2 + a % 2` is printed. If `a` > `n // 2`, the result of the expression is printed as a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` and `a`, from user input, where `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100,000] and `a` is an integer in the range [1, n]. It then prints a calculated value based on the following conditions: if `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, it prints `a // 2 + a % 2`; otherwise, it prints `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed value, which is a positive integer representing the result of the specified calculation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `a` is an even number correctly. According to the problem description, the even-numbered houses are located on the opposite side of the street, and their numbering decreases from the end of the street to the beginning. Therefore, the time to reach an even-numbered house should be calculated differently than for an odd-numbered house.

For example, if `n = 8` and `a = 6`, the program incorrectly calculates the time as:

- Since `a > n // 2`, it uses the formula `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.
- This results in `(8 - 6 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 6 + 1) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

However, the correct time to reach house 6 should be 3 seconds, as house 6 is the third house from the end of the street on the right side.

The correct approach should consider the position of the house relative to the start of the street, taking into account the specific numbering scheme for even-numbered houses.
