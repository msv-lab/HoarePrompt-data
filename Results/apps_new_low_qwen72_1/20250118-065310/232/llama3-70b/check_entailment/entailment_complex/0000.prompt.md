Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The main street of Berland is a straight line with n houses built along it (n is an even number). The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2, house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on.

Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a. To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n, he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.

Your task is: find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house a.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers, n and a (1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of houses on the street and the number of the house that Vasya needs to reach, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that number n is even.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum time Vasya needs to get from the beginning of the street to house a.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
8 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample there are only four houses on the street, two houses at each side. House 2 will be the last at Vasya's right.

The second sample corresponds to picture with n = 8. House 5 is the one before last at Vasya's left.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and a is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n.
def func():
    n, a = map(int, input().split())
    if (a <= n // 2) :
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else :
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer input by the user where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ a ≤ n. If `a` ≤ `n // 2`, the value `a // 2 + a % 2` is printed. If `a` > `n // 2`, the result of the expression is printed as a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` and `a`, from user input, where `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100,000] and `a` is an integer in the range [1, n]. It then prints a calculated value based on the following conditions: if `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, it prints `a // 2 + a % 2`; otherwise, it prints `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed value, which is a positive integer representing the result of the specified calculation.
