Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify that it correctly computes the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house `a` based on the given problem description and constraints.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **House Layout**:
   - Houses with odd numbers are on one side of the street, numbered from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - Houses with even numbers are on the other side, numbered from \( n \) to 2.
   - Each house has a corresponding house directly opposite it.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - To reach house `a`, Vasya can drive to the nearest house on either side of the street.
   - The time to reach a house is determined by the position of the house relative to the start of the street.

### Program Analysis:
- **Input**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `a`.
- **Condition Check**:
  - If `a` is less than or equal to \( n // 2 \), the program calculates the time using `a // 2 + a % 2`.
  - If `a` is greater than \( n // 2 \), the program calculates the time using \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2\).

### Verification:
1. **For \( a \leq n // 2 \)**:
   - The time to reach house `a` is calculated as `a // 2 + a % 2`.
   - This formula works because:
     - `a // 2` gives the number of full steps needed to reach the house.
     - `a % 2` adds an extra second if `a` is odd (since it takes an additional second to reach an odd-numbered house).

2. **For \( a > n // 2 \)**:
   - The time to reach house `a` is calculated as \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.
   - This formula works because:
     - `n - a + 1` gives the position of the house on the opposite side of the street.
     - \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2\) calculates the time to reach this house in a similar manner as the first case.

### Examples:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `4 2`
  - Since `a = 2` and `2 <= 4 // 2`, the program calculates `2 // 2 + 2 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.
  - However, the expected output is `2`, which suggests a mistake in the reasoning for this case. The correct calculation should be `2 // 2 + 2 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1` but considering the layout, it should be `2`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `8 5`
  - Since `a = 5` and `5 > 8 // 2`, the program calculates \((8 - 5 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 5 + 1) % 2 = 4 // 2 + 4 % 2 = 2 + 0 = 2`.
  - The expected output is `3`, which suggests a mistake in the reasoning for this case. The correct calculation should be \((8 - 5 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 5 + 1) % 2 = 4 // 2 + 4 % 2 = 2 + 0 = 2` but considering the layout, it should be `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the edge cases and the logic for calculating the time to reach the house is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
