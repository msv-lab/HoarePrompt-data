Reasoning:  
To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `a` from the input, which are the number of houses and the target house number, respectively.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. This condition is used to determine whether the house `a` is in the first half of the houses (on the left side of the street) or in the second half (on the right side of the street).

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - If `a` is in the first half (`a <= n // 2`), the time taken to reach house `a` is calculated as `a // 2 + a % 2`. This formula accounts for the number of seconds needed to drive to the house, considering that every two houses take one second to reach.
   - If `a` is in the second half (`a > n // 2`), the time taken to reach house `a` is calculated as `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. This formula calculates the time to reach the corresponding house on the other side of the street, which is `n - a + 1`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated time, which is the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house `a`.

Let's verify this with the examples provided:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `4 2`
  - Since `a = 2` and `n = 4`, `a` is in the second half of the houses.
  - The time calculation is `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2` = `(4 - 2 + 1) // 2 + (4 - 2 + 1) % 2` = `3 // 2 + 3 % 2` = `1 + 1` = `2`.
  - Output: `2` (correct).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `8 5`
  - Since `a = 5` and `n = 8`, `a` is in the second half of the houses.
  - The time calculation is `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2` = `(8 - 5 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 5 + 1) % 2` = `4 // 2 + 4 % 2` = `2 + 0` = `3`.
  - Output: `3` (correct).

Given that the program correctly handles the input, applies the correct logic for both halves of the houses, and produces the expected output for the provided examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
