Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `a` is an even number correctly. According to the problem description, the even-numbered houses are located on the opposite side of the street, and their numbering decreases from the end of the street to the beginning. Therefore, the time to reach an even-numbered house should be calculated differently than for an odd-numbered house.

For example, if `n = 8` and `a = 6`, the program incorrectly calculates the time as:

- Since `a > n // 2`, it uses the formula `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.
- This results in `(8 - 6 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 6 + 1) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

However, the correct time to reach house 6 should be 3 seconds, as house 6 is the third house from the end of the street on the right side.

The correct approach should consider the position of the house relative to the start of the street, taking into account the specific numbering scheme for even-numbered houses.
