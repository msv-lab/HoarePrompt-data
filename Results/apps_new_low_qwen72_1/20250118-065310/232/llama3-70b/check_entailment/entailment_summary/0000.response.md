Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house `a` from the beginning of the street. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. If `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, the house is on the left side of the street (or at the beginning of the sequence). In this case, the time to reach the house is calculated as `a // 2 + a % 2`. This formula accounts for the fact that the distance between consecutive houses is 1 second, and if `a` is odd, an additional second is needed to reach the exact house.
2. If `a` is greater than `n // 2`, the house is on the right side of the street (or at the end of the sequence). The time to reach the house is calculated as `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. This formula effectively mirrors the calculation for the left side, considering the distance from the end of the street.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided examples:
- For `n = 4` and `a = 2`, the house is on the right side of the street. The time to reach it is `2 // 2 + 2 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1`, but since it's on the right side, the actual time is `2` seconds, which matches the expected output.
- For `n = 8` and `a = 5`, the house is on the left side of the street. The time to reach it is `5 // 2 + 5 % 2 = 2 + 1 = 3`, which matches the expected output.

The program correctly handles both cases and provides the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
