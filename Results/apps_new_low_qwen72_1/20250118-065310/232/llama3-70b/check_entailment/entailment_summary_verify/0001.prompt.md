You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The main street of Berland is a straight line with n houses built along it (n is an even number). The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2, house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on. [Image] 

Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a. To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n, he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.

Your task is: find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house a.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers, n and a (1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of houses on the street and the number of the house that Vasya needs to reach, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that number n is even.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum time Vasya needs to get from the beginning of the street to house a.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
8 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample there are only four houses on the street, two houses at each side. House 2 will be the last at Vasya's right.

The second sample corresponds to picture with n = 8. House 5 is the one before last at Vasya's left.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers, `n` and `a`, from user input, where `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100,000] and `a` is an integer in the range [1, n]. It then prints a calculated value based on the following conditions: if `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, it prints `a // 2 + a % 2`; otherwise, it prints `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed value, which is a positive integer representing the result of the specified calculation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it accurately calculates the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house `a` based on the problem description. Let's break down the logic:

1. **House Numbering and Opposite Houses:**
   - Odd-numbered houses are on one side of the street, starting from 1 up to \( n-1 \).
   - Even-numbered houses are on the other side of the street, starting from \( n \) down to 2.
   - House \( 1 \) is opposite house \( n \), house \( 3 \) is opposite house \( n-2 \), and so on.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To reach house \( a \), Vasya can either drive to the house directly or to its opposite house, whichever is closer.
   - For odd-numbered houses \( a \leq n/2 \), the time to reach house \( a \) is \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \).
   - For even-numbered houses \( a > n/2 \), the time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) is \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \).

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
```

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The program correctly parses the input values \( n \) and \( a \).

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if a <= n // 2:` checks if the house number \( a \) is less than or equal to half of the total number of houses.
  - If true, it calculates the time to reach house \( a \) using `a // 2 + a % 2`.
  - If false, it calculates the time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) using `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the calculated time.

The logic in the program matches the problem description and handles both cases (odd and even house numbers) correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.
