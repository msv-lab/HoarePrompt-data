Reasoning: 

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's re-evaluate the logic and the provided examples step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **House Numbering and Opposite Houses:**
   - Odd-numbered houses are on one side of the street, starting from 1 up to \( n-1 \).
   - Even-numbered houses are on the other side of the street, starting from \( n \) down to 2.
   - House \( 1 \) is opposite house \( n \), house \( 3 \) is opposite house \( n-2 \), and so on.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - Vasya can either drive to the house directly or to its opposite house, whichever is closer.
   - For odd-numbered houses \( a \leq n/2 \), the time to reach house \( a \) is \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \).
   - For even-numbered houses \( a > n/2 \), the time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) is \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \).

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
```

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The program correctly parses the input values \( n \) and \( a \).

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if a <= n // 2:` checks if the house number \( a \) is less than or equal to half of the total number of houses.
  - If true, it calculates the time to reach house \( a \) using `a // 2 + a % 2`.
  - If false, it calculates the time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) using `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.

### Example Verification:
1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 2 \)
   - Since \( a = 2 \) and \( 2 \leq 4 // 2 \), the program calculates:
     \[
     2 // 2 + 2 \% 2 = 1 + 0 = 1
     \]
   - However, the correct output should be 2, because house 2 is the last house on the right side, which is 2 seconds away from the start.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: \( n = 8 \), \( a = 5 \)
   - Since \( a = 5 \) and \( 5 > 8 // 2 \), the program calculates the time to reach the opposite house \( 8 - 5 + 1 = 4 \):
     \[
     4 // 2 + 4 \% 2 = 2 + 0 = 2
     \]
   - However, the correct output should be 3, because house 5 is the one before the last on the left side, which is 3 seconds away from the start.

### Correct Calculation:
- For odd-numbered houses \( a \leq n/2 \), the correct time is:
  \[
  \text{time} = \left\lceil \frac{a}{2} \right\rceil
  \]
- For even-numbered houses \( a > n/2 \), the correct time to reach the opposite house \( n - a + 1 \) is:
  \[
  \text{time} = \left\lceil \frac{n - a + 1}{2} \right\rceil
  \]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print((a + 1) // 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 2) // 2)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly handle the time calculation for both odd and even-numbered houses. The corrected program provides the correct time based on the problem description.

Final: **False**
