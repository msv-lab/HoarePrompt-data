The function reads two integers, `n` and `a`, from user input, where `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100,000] and `a` is an integer in the range [1, n]. It then prints a calculated value based on the following conditions: if `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, it prints `a // 2 + a % 2`; otherwise, it prints `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed value, which is a positive integer representing the result of the specified calculation.
