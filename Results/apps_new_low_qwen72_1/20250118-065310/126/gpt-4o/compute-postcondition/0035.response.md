Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of the second sublist, `s` is the second element of the second sublist, `r` is the third element of the second sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the second sublist, `j` is 0, and `accident_possible` is True if `l` is 1 or `s` is 1 or `r` is 1; otherwise, `accident_possible` is False. Additionally, the element at `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is 1, which means the element at `traffic_lights[1][0]` is 1.***
