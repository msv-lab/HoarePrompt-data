The code snippet appends a new sublist to `traffic_lights`, which is obtained by converting the input (four space-separated integers) into a list of integers.

Given the initial state:
- Each of the four input lines contains four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights for each road part, where l, s, r, and p can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light).
- `traffic_lights` is a list containing two sublists, each with four elements.
- The first sublist remains unchanged.
- The second sublist is the result of the input.
- `_` is 2.

After executing the code:
- A new sublist, converted from the input, is appended to `traffic_lights`.
- The first sublist in `traffic_lights` remains unchanged.
- The second sublist in `traffic_lights` is still the result of the previous input.
- The new third sublist in `traffic_lights` is the result of the current input.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing three sublists, each with four elements: the first sublist remains unchanged, the second sublist is the result of the previous input, and the third sublist is the result of the current input, `_` is 2.**
