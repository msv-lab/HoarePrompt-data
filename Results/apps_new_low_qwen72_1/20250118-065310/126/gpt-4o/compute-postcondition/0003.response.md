For the given task, the only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the iteration variable used in the `range(4)` loop. The state of the `traffic_lights` list and the individual elements (l, s, r, p) are not directly modified by the loop head itself.

Since the loop is iterating over a fixed range of 4, the loop will execute 4 times regardless of the state of the `traffic_lights` list. The variable `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration until it reaches 4, at which point the loop will terminate.

Given that the loop has already executed once, the variable `_` would have been 0 during the first iteration. For the next iteration, `_` will be incremented to 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **Each of the four input lines contains four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights for each road part, where l, s, r, and p can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light), `traffic_lights` is a list containing one sublist with four elements, each being 0 or 1, `_` is 1**
