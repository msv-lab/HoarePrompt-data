Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of the second sublist, `s` is the second element of the second sublist, `r` is the third element of the second sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the second sublist, `j` is 0. If `traffic_lights[1][0]` is 1, then `accident_possible` is True. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains as it was determined by the values of `l`, `s`, and `r` (True if `l` is 1 or `s` is 1 or `r` is 1; otherwise, `accident_possible` is False).***
