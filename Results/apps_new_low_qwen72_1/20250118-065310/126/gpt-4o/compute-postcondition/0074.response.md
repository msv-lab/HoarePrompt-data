The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the problem statement, it implicitly accepts four integers per line, totaling four lines. Each set of four integers represents the state of traffic lights for each road part, where each integer can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light).

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the function processes the states of the traffic lights and likely returns some form of result based on the combination of these states.

Since the exact output is not provided, I'll describe the most plausible scenario:

**Functionality: The function processes the states of traffic lights represented by four sets of four integers each (l, s, r, p), where each integer can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light). The function returns a result based on the combination of these states, though the specific nature of the result is not defined.**
