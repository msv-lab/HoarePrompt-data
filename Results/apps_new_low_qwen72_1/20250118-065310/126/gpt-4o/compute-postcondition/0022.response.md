The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range defined by `range(3)`. Therefore, we can only adjust `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than 3.

State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements (unchanged), `_` is 3, `i` is 0, `l` is the first element of the first sublist, `s` is the second element of the first sublist, `r` is the third element of the first sublist, `p` is 1, `j` is 2. If the element at index `((i + j) % 4, j)` in `traffic_lights` is 1, then `accident_possible` is True. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False.**
