The provided Python code initializes an empty list named `traffic_lights`. This action does not affect any of the initial conditions regarding the four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights, which remain unchanged. The only change is the creation of the empty list `traffic_lights`.

Output State: **Each of the four input lines contains four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights for each road part, where l, s, r, and p can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light), `traffic_lights` is an empty list.**
