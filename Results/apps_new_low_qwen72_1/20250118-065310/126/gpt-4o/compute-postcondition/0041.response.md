The only variables in the loop head are `j`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Since `j` is still less than 3, the loop will execute again.

State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of the second sublist, `s` is the second element of the second sublist, `r` is the third element of the second sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the second sublist, `j` is 2. If `traffic_lights[1][0]` is 1, then `accident_possible` is True. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains as it was determined by the values of `l`, `s`, and `r` (True if `l` is 1 or `s` is 1 or `r` is 1; otherwise, `accident_possible` is False).**
