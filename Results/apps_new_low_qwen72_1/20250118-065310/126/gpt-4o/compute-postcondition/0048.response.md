Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of the second sublist, `s` is the second element of the second sublist, `r` is the third element of the second sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the second sublist. If `p` is 1, `j` is 2, and if any of the elements at indices `(0, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, or `(2, 2)` in `traffic_lights` is 1, or if `l` is 1, `s` is 1, or `r` is 1, then `accident_possible` is True. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False. If `p` is not 1, `accident_possible` remains False.***
