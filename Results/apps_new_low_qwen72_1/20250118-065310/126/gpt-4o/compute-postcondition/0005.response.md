The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and it serves as the loop counter implicitly managed by the `range(4)` function. Since `_` is not directly modified by the user but incremented by the loop mechanism, the only thing we need to consider is the condition for the loop to continue executing.

Given that the loop iterates 4 times (`range(4)`), the loop will execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than 4. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, so for the next iteration:

- `_` will be incremented to 2.
- The loop will continue to execute because 2 is still less than 4.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the increment of `_`.

State: **Each of the four input lines contains four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights for each road part, where l, s, r, and p can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light), `traffic_lights` is a list containing two sublists, each with four elements, the first sublist remains unchanged, and the second sublist is the result of the input, `_` is 2**
