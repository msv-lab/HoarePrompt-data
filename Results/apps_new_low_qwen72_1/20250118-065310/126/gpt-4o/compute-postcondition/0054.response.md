Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 2, `l` is the first element of the third sublist, `s` is the second element of the third sublist, `r` is the third element of the third sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the third sublist, `j` is 2 if `p` is 1, and if `l` is 1, `s` is 1, or `r` is 1, then `accident_possible` is True. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False. The current value of `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is 1.***
