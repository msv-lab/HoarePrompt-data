Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of the second sublist, `s` is the second element of the second sublist, `r` is the third element of the second sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the second sublist, `j` is 2. If any of `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` for `j` in [0, 1, 2] is 1, or if `l` is 1, `s` is 1, or `r` is 1, then `accident_possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains as it was determined by the values of `l`, `s`, and `r` (True if `l` is 1 or `s` is 1 or `r` is 1; otherwise, `accident_possible` is False).***
