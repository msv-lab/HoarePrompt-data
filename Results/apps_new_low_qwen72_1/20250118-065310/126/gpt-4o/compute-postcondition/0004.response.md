The code appends a new sublist to the `traffic_lights` list, which is created by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The initial state specifies that `traffic_lights` already contains one sublist with four elements, each being 0 or 1. After executing the code, `traffic_lights` will contain two sublists, the first one remains unchanged, and the second one is the result of the input.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in the existing sublist, we will keep that part of the state as is. The new sublist will be the result of the input, which is split and converted to integers.

Output State: **Each of the four input lines contains four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights for each road part, where l, s, r, and p can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light), `traffic_lights` is a list containing two sublists, each with four elements, the first sublist remains unchanged, and the second sublist is the result of the input, `_` is 1**.
