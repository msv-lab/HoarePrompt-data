Functionality: ** The function `func` reads four lines of input, each containing four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of traffic lights for each road part, where each integer can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light). The function checks for the possibility of an accident based on the following conditions:
- If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), and any of the other lights (l, s, r) in the same road part are green (1), an accident is possible.
- If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), and any of the corresponding lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts are green (1), an accident is possible.

If an accident is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function executes, the state of the program includes:
- `traffic_lights` is a list of four sublists, each containing four integers.
- `accident_possible` is a boolean indicating whether an accident is possible.
- The input values are consumed and no longer available for further processing. **

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Input Validation:** The function does not validate the input to ensure that exactly four lines of input are provided, each containing exactly four integers (0 or 1). If the input is invalid, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results.
- **Multiple Pedestrian Lights:** The function assumes that only one pedestrian light can be green at a time. If multiple pedestrian lights are green simultaneously, the function will still correctly identify if an accident is possible, but this scenario should be considered.
- **No Return Value:** The function does not return any value; it only prints 'YES' or 'NO'. If the caller needs to use the result programmatically, they would need to capture the printed output or modify the function to return the result.
