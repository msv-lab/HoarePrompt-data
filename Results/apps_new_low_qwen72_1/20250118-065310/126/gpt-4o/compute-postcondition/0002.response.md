The code appends a list of four integers (representing the state of the traffic lights) to the `traffic_lights` list. This operation is performed once, and the `traffic_lights` list now contains one sublist with four elements, each being 0 or 1.

Output State: **Each of the four input lines contains four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights for each road part, where l, s, r, and p can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light), `traffic_lights` is a list containing one sublist with four elements, each being 0 or 1, and the loop will execute because the range is 4.**
