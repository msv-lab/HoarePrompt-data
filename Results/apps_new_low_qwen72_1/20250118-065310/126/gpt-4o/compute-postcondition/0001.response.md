The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range value, which is 4. The loop's execution is solely dependent on this range value. For the loop to execute the first time, the range must be at least 1. Since the range is specified as 4, the loop will definitely execute.

The state of the traffic lights and the `traffic_lights` list do not affect the loop's execution directly, as they are not part of the loop head condition. However, for the loop to be meaningful in the context of the problem, we should assume that the `traffic_lights` list will be modified within the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
State: **Each of the four input lines contains four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights for each road part, where l, s, r, and p can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light), `traffic_lights` is an empty list, and the loop will execute because the range is 4.**
