Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements (unchanged), `_` is 3, `i` is 0, `l` is the first element of the first sublist, `s` is the second element of the first sublist, `r` is the third element of the first sublist. If `p` is 1, `j` is 2, and if any of the elements at indices `(0, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, or `(2, 2)` in `traffic_lights` is 1, then `accident_possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False. If `p` is not 1, `accident_possible` remains False.***
