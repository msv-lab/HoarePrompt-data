Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 2, `l` is the first element of the third sublist, `s` is the second element of the third sublist, `r` is the third element of the third sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the third sublist, `j` is 3. If any of `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` for `j` in range(3) is 1, `accident_possible` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False.***
