The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the nearest enclosing loop (for, while) or conditional block (if). Since there's no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned in the context, we assume this `break` is part of such a structure that is not shown in the snippet. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the control flow is altered to exit the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of the second sublist, `s` is the second element of the second sublist, `r` is the third element of the second sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the second sublist, `j` is 2. `accident_possible` is True, indicating that either `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, or at least one of `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` for `j` in [0, 1, 2] is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
