Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

# Program:
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
    if accident_possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads four lines of input, each containing four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of traffic lights for each road part, where each integer can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light). The function checks for the possibility of an accident based on the following conditions:
- If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), and any of the other lights (l, s, r) in the same road part are green (1), an accident is possible.
- If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), and any of the corresponding lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts are green (1), an accident is possible.

If an accident is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function executes, the state of the program includes:
- `traffic_lights` is a list of four sublists, each containing four integers.
- `accident_possible` is a boolean indicating whether an accident is possible.
- The input values are consumed and no longer available for further processing.
