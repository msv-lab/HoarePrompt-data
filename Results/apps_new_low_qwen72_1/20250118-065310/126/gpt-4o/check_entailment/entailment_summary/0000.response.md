Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to check if an accident is possible based on the traffic light configurations provided. Here's a detailed analysis of the logic and implementation:

1. **Input Reading**: The function correctly reads the input and stores it in a list of lists called `traffic_lights`. Each sublist contains four integers representing the states of the left (l), straight (s), right (r), and pedestrian (p) lights for each road part.

2. **Initial Check**: For each road part, the function checks if the pedestrian light (p) is green (1). If it is, it then checks if any of the other lights (l, s, r) in the same road part are green. If any of these lights are green, an accident is possible, and the function sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Cross-Part Check**: If the pedestrian light (p) is green but none of the other lights (l, s, r) in the same road part are green, the function then checks the corresponding lights in the next three road parts. Specifically, it checks if any of the lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts are green. If any of these lights are green, an accident is possible, and the function sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**: Finally, the function prints 'YES' if an accident is possible (`accident_possible` is `True`), and 'NO' otherwise.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Cross-Part Check Logic**: The current implementation of the cross-part check is incorrect. The loop `for j in range(3)` should iterate over the indices of the lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts. However, the condition `if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1` is not correct. It should check the corresponding lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts, not the same index.

Here is the corrected version of the cross-part check:

```python
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(1, 4):
                next_part_index = (i + j) % 4
                if traffic_lights[next_part_index][0] == 1 or traffic_lights[next_part_index][1] == 1 or traffic_lights[next_part_index][2] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
    if accident_possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- **Corrected Cross-Part Check**: The loop `for j in range(1, 4)` iterates over the next three road parts. For each of these parts, it checks if any of the lights (l, s, r) are green. If any of these lights are green, it sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The original program had a logical error in the cross-part check. With the corrected implementation, the program correctly identifies whether an accident is possible based on the given traffic light configurations.

Correctness: **False** (due to the initial logical error in the cross-part check)  
Correctness: **True** (after the correction)
