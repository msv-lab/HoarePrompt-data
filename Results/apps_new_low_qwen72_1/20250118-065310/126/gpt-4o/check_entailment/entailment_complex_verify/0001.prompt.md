You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

def func():
    traffic_lights = []

        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each of the four input lines contains four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of the traffic lights for each road part, where l, s, r, and p can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements: the first sublist remains unchanged, the second sublist is the result of the second input, the third sublist is the result of the third input, and the fourth sublist is the result of the fourth input, `_` is 3. The loop executes 4 times as specified by the range(4).

If any of the conditions in the loop were met, `accident_possible` is True; otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False.

        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`traffic_lights` is a list containing four sublists, each with four elements, `_` is 3, `i` is 3, `l` is the first element of the fourth sublist, `s` is the second element of the fourth sublist, `r` is the third element of the fourth sublist, `p` is the fourth element of the fourth sublist. If `accident_possible` is True, it remains True; otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads four lines of input, each containing four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of traffic lights for each road part, where each integer can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light). The function checks for the possibility of an accident based on the following conditions:
- If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), and any of the other lights (l, s, r) in the same road part are green (1), an accident is possible.
- If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), and any of the corresponding lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts are green (1), an accident is possible.

If an accident is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function executes, the state of the program includes:
- `traffic_lights` is a list of four sublists, each containing four integers.
- `accident_possible` is a boolean indicating whether an accident is possible.
- The input values are consumed and no longer available for further processing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The function `func` reads the traffic light configurations for each of the four parts of the intersection. It checks if an accident is possible by evaluating the conditions under which a pedestrian crossing light (p) and any of the vehicle lights (l, s, r) in the same part or any part that could interact with the pedestrian crossing are both green. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the traffic light status for each of the four parts and stores them in a list `traffic_lights`.

2. **Checking for Accidents**:
   - For each part `i`, it checks if the pedestrian light `p` is green (`p == 1`).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, it then checks if any of the vehicle lights (left, straight, right) in the same part are also green (`l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1`). If so, an accident is possible.
   - Additionally, it checks if any of the vehicle lights in the other parts (0, 1, 2) that can reach the pedestrian crossing are green. This is done using a loop that iterates over the three other parts and checks their corresponding vehicle lights.

3. **Breaking Early**: If an accident is found to be possible, the function sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary further checks.

4. **Output**: Finally, the function prints "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.

The logic correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. It ensures that an accident is possible if a pedestrian light is green and any vehicle light in the same or interacting parts is also green.
