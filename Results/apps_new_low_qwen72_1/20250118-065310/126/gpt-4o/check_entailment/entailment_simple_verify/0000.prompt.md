You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]
        if p == 1:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in its implementation that could lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Specifically, the inner loop that checks other parts' lights is not correctly structured to ensure that it only checks the relevant lanes that could potentially cause an accident with the pedestrian crossing.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```
According to the problem description, an accident is possible if a pedestrian crossing light is green and any of the lanes that can reach or leave that part have a green light. In this case, the pedestrian crossing light for part 1 is green (`p = 1`), and the left turn lane (`l = 1`) is also green. However, the program will incorrectly check the lanes of other parts (parts 2, 3, and 4) in a way that does not align with the problem's definition of potential accidents.

The program should only check the lanes of the current part and the lanes of the adjacent parts that can directly interact with the pedestrian crossing. The current implementation does not correctly handle this logic, leading to potential false negatives.

To fix this, the program should be modified to only check the lanes of the current part and the adjacent parts that can directly interact with the pedestrian crossing.
