### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function correctly reads the traffic light configurations for each of the four parts and stores them in a list `traffic_lights`.

2. **Checking for Accidents**:
   - For each part `i`, it checks if the pedestrian light `p` is green (`p == 1`).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, it then checks if any of the vehicle lights (left, straight, right) in the same part are also green (`l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1`). If so, an accident is possible.
   - Additionally, it checks if any of the vehicle lights in the other parts (0, 1, 2) that can reach the pedestrian crossing are green. This is done using a loop that iterates over the three other parts and checks their corresponding vehicle lights.

3. **Breaking Early**:
   - If an accident is found to be possible, the function sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary further checks.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the function prints "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Conditions**:
  - The condition `if p == 1:` correctly identifies when the pedestrian light is green.
  - The condition `if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:` correctly identifies if any vehicle light in the same part is green.
  - The nested loop `for j in range(3):` and the condition `if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:` correctly checks if any vehicle light in the next three parts is green.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description. It correctly identifies scenarios where an accident is possible and where it is not.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function efficiently breaks out of the loop once an accident is detected, avoiding unnecessary checks.

### Conclusion:

The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine if an accident is possible based on the given traffic light configurations. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
