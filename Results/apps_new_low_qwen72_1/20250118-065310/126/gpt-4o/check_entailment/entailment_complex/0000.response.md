Reasoning:

The function `func` reads four lines of input, each containing four integers representing the state of traffic lights for each road part. It checks for the possibility of an accident based on the following conditions:

1. If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1) and any of the other lights (l, s, r) in the same road part are green (1), an accident is possible.
2. If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1) and any of the corresponding lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts are green (1), an accident is possible.

The logic in the function correctly implements these conditions:

- For each road part, it checks if the pedestrian light (p) is green.
- If the pedestrian light is green, it checks if any of the car lights (l, s, r) in the same part are green.
- Additionally, it checks if any of the corresponding car lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts are green.

The function correctly identifies the scenarios where an accident is possible and prints 'YES' if such a scenario is found, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the function appears to handle all cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
