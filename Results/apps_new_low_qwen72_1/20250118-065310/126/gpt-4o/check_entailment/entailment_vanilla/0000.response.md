Reasoning:  
The function `func` reads the traffic light configurations for each of the four parts of the intersection. It checks if an accident is possible by evaluating the conditions under which a pedestrian crossing light (p) and any of the vehicle lights (l, s, r) in the same part or any part that could interact with the pedestrian crossing are both green. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the traffic light status for each of the four parts and stores them in a list `traffic_lights`.

2. **Checking for Accidents**:
   - For each part `i`, it checks if the pedestrian light `p` is green (`p == 1`).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, it then checks if any of the vehicle lights (left, straight, right) in the same part are also green (`l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1`). If so, an accident is possible.
   - Additionally, it checks if any of the vehicle lights in the other parts (0, 1, 2) that can reach the pedestrian crossing are green. This is done using a loop that iterates over the three other parts and checks their corresponding vehicle lights.

3. **Breaking Early**: If an accident is found to be possible, the function sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary further checks.

4. **Output**: Finally, the function prints "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.

The logic correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. It ensures that an accident is possible if a pedestrian light is green and any vehicle light in the same or interacting parts is also green.

Correctness: **True**
