Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in its implementation that could lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Specifically, the inner loop that checks other parts' lights is not correctly structured to ensure that it only checks the relevant lanes that could potentially cause an accident with the pedestrian crossing.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```
According to the problem description, an accident is possible if a pedestrian crossing light is green and any of the lanes that can reach or leave that part have a green light. In this case, the pedestrian crossing light for part 1 is green (`p = 1`), and the left turn lane (`l = 1`) is also green. However, the program will incorrectly check the lanes of other parts (parts 2, 3, and 4) in a way that does not align with the problem's definition of potential accidents.

The program should only check the lanes of the current part and the lanes of the adjacent parts that can directly interact with the pedestrian crossing. The current implementation does not correctly handle this logic, leading to potential false negatives.

To fix this, the program should be modified to only check the lanes of the current part and the adjacent parts that can directly interact with the pedestrian crossing.
