The function `func` reads four lines of input, each containing four integers (l, s, r, p) representing the state of traffic lights for each road part, where each integer can be 0 (red light) or 1 (green light). The function checks for the possibility of an accident based on the following conditions:
- If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), and any of the other lights (l, s, r) in the same road part are green (1), an accident is possible.
- If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), and any of the corresponding lights (l, s, r) in the next three road parts are green (1), an accident is possible.

If an accident is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function executes, the state of the program includes:
- `traffic_lights` is a list of four sublists, each containing four integers.
- `accident_possible` is a boolean indicating whether an accident is possible.
- The input values are consumed and no longer available for further processing.
