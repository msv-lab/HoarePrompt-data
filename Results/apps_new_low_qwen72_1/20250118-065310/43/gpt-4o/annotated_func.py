The variable `count` is the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`.

    #The program returns the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`. Here, `all_binary_strings` is a list of all binary strings of length `n`, and `s` is a binary string of length between 1 and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and `s` (a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n). It generates all possible binary strings of length `n` and counts how many of these strings are cyclic substrings of `s`. The function returns the total count of such binary strings. If `s` is an empty string or `n` is 0, the function will return 0. If `n` is greater than 40 or less than 1, the behavior is undefined and may result in errors or incorrect results.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a binary string of length n, s is a binary string of length between 1 and n inclusive, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40.
def is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
    t_extended = t + t
    return s in t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns True if the binary string `s` is a substring of the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of `t_extended`, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `is_cyclic_substring` takes two parameters: `t`, a binary string of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40), and `s`, a binary string of length between 1 and `n` inclusive. It returns `True` if `s` is a cyclic substring of `t`, meaning `s` can be found within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of the concatenated string `t + t`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles cases where `s` is a substring of `t` or a cyclic permutation of `t`. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases where `t` or `s` might be empty strings, although the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 40 and the length of `s` being between 1 and `n`) imply that these edge cases should not occur.
