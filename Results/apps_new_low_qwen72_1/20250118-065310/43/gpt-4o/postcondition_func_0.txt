The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and `s` (a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n). It generates all possible binary strings of length `n` and counts how many of these strings are cyclic substrings of `s`. The function returns the total count of such binary strings. If `s` is an empty string or `n` is 0, the function will return 0. If `n` is greater than 40 or less than 1, the behavior is undefined and may result in errors or incorrect results.
