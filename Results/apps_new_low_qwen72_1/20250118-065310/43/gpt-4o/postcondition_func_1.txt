The function `is_cyclic_substring` takes two parameters: `t`, a binary string of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40), and `s`, a binary string of length between 1 and `n` inclusive. It returns `True` if `s` is a cyclic substring of `t`, meaning `s` can be found within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of the concatenated string `t + t`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles cases where `s` is a substring of `t` or a cyclic permutation of `t`. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases where `t` or `s` might be empty strings, although the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 40 and the length of `s` being between 1 and `n`) imply that these edge cases should not occur.
