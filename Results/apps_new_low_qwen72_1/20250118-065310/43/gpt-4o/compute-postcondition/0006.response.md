The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` is 1 if `t` is a cyclic substring of `s`, otherwise it is 0. After the increment, `count` will be 2 if `t` is a cyclic substring of `s`, otherwise it will be 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \), `s` is a binary string of length \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \), `all_binary_strings` is a list of binary strings of length \( n \) with at least one more element, `t` is the second binary string in `all_binary_strings`. If `t` is a cyclic substring of `s`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.
