Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \), `s` is a binary string of length \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \), `all_binary_strings` is a non-empty list of binary strings of length \( n \), `t` is the first binary string in `all_binary_strings`. If `t` is a cyclic substring of `s`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
