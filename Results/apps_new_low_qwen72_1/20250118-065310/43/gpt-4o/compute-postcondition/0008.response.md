The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and `all_binary_strings`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `all_binary_strings`. If `all_binary_strings` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was the second binary string in `all_binary_strings`, and `all_binary_strings` had at least one more element. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must now be the third binary string in `all_binary_strings`, and `all_binary_strings` must still have at least one more element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \), `s` is a binary string of length \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \), `all_binary_strings` is a list of binary strings of length \( n \) with at least two more elements, `t` is the third binary string in `all_binary_strings`. If `t` is a cyclic substring of `s`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.**
