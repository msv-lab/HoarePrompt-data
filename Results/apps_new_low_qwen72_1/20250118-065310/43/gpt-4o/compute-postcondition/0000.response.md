`t_extended` is assigned the value of `t + t`, which means `t_extended` is now a binary string that consists of `t` concatenated with itself. The length of `t_extended` is therefore `2 * n`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a binary string of length `n`, `s` is a binary string of length between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 40, `t_extended` is a binary string of length `2 * n` and equals `t + t`.**
