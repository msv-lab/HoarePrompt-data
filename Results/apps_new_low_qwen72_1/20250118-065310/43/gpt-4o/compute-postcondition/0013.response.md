The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, and `s` is a binary string with the length constraint 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n. The function returns the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`. Here, `all_binary_strings` is a list of all binary strings of length `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `s`. It returns the total number of binary strings of length `n` that are cyclic substrings of `s`.**
