The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `count` could be either 1 or 2 depending on whether `t` is a cyclic substring of `s`, the new value of `count` will be 2 or 3 respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \), `s` is a binary string of length \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \), `all_binary_strings` is a list of binary strings of length \( n \) with at least two more elements, `t` is the third binary string in `all_binary_strings`, if `t` is a cyclic substring of `s`, then `count` is 3, otherwise `count` is 2.**
