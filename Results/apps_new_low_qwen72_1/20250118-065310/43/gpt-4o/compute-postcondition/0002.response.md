The function `is_cyclic_substring` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is a binary string of length `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 40`, and `s` is a binary string of length between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function returns `True` if the binary string `s` is a substring of the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of an extended version of `t` (denoted as `t_extended`). Otherwise, it returns `False`.
