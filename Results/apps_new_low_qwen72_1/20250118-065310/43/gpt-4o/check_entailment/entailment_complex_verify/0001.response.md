Reasoning:

The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `is_cyclic_substring`. Let's analyze each part and the overall logic to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Function `func_1`

1. **Generating All Binary Strings:**
   ```python
   all_binary_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('01', repeat=n)]
   ```
   This line generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using the `itertools.product` function. This is correct and efficient for the given constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 40\).

2. **Counting Cyclic Substrings:**
   ```python
   count = 0
   for t in all_binary_strings:
       if is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
           count += 1
   return count
   ```
   This loop iterates over each generated binary string `t` and uses the `is_cyclic_substring` function to check if `s` is a cyclic substring of `t`. If it is, the count is incremented. This part is logically sound.

### Function `is_cyclic_substring`

1. **Concatenating the String:**
   ```python
   t_extended = t + t
   ```
   This concatenation creates a string that represents all possible cyclic shifts of `t`. This is a correct approach to handle the cyclic nature of the problem.

2. **Checking for Substring:**
   ```python
   return s in t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]
   ```
   The original assessment mentions a potential issue with the slicing `t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]`. However, this slicing is actually correct for the given problem. The reason is that the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of `t_extended` are sufficient to cover all possible cyclic shifts of `t` where `s` could be a substring.

   To understand why, consider the following:
   - The length of `t_extended` is `2n`.
   - The maximum length of `s` is `n`.
   - To check if `s` is a cyclic substring of `t`, we need to consider all possible positions where `s` could start in the cyclic shifts of `t`.
   - The slicing `t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]` ensures that we cover all possible starting positions of `s` within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of `t_extended`.

   Therefore, the slicing is correct and does not miss any valid cyclic substrings.

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly identified a potential issue with the slicing in the `is_cyclic_substring` function. The slicing `t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]` is indeed correct and ensures that all possible cyclic shifts are considered. Thus, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
