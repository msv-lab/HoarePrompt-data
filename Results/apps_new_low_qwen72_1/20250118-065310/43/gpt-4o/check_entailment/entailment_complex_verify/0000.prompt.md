You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.

-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, s):

    from itertools import product
    all_binary_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('01', repeat=n)]
    count = 0
    for t in all_binary_strings:
        if is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
    t_extended = t + t
    return s in t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
s = input()
print(func_1(n, s))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, s is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n.
def func_1(n, s):
    all_binary_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('01', repeat=n)]

count = 0
    for t in all_binary_strings:
        if is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \), `s` is a binary string of length \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \), `all_binary_strings` is a list of all binary strings of length \( n \). The variable `count` is the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`. Here, `all_binary_strings` is a list of all binary strings of length `n`, and `s` is a binary string of length between 1 and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and `s` (a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n). It generates all possible binary strings of length `n` and counts how many of these strings are cyclic substrings of `s`. The function returns the total count of such binary strings. If `s` is an empty string or `n` is 0, the function will return 0. If `n` is greater than 40 or less than 1, the behavior is undefined and may result in errors or incorrect results.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a binary string of length n, s is a binary string of length between 1 and n inclusive, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40.
def is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
    t_extended = t + t
    return s in t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns True if the binary string `s` is a substring of the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of `t_extended`, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `is_cyclic_substring` takes two parameters: `t`, a binary string of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40), and `s`, a binary string of length between 1 and `n` inclusive. It returns `True` if `s` is a cyclic substring of `t`, meaning `s` can be found within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of the concatenated string `t + t`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles cases where `s` is a substring of `t` or a cyclic permutation of `t`. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases where `t` or `s` might be empty strings, although the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 40 and the length of `s` being between 1 and `n`) imply that these edge cases should not occur.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using `itertools.product`.
   - Iterates through each generated binary string and checks if it contains `s` as a cyclic substring using the helper function `is_cyclic_substring`.
   - Counts and returns the number of such binary strings.

2. **Function `is_cyclic_substring`**:
   - Extends the binary string `t` by concatenating it with itself (`t + t`).
   - Checks if `s` is a substring of the extended string within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters to account for all possible cyclic shifts.

The approach ensures that all possible cyclic shifts are considered, and the program correctly counts the number of distinct cyclical binary strings that contain `s` as a substring. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would make the program incorrect. Therefore, the program is correct.
