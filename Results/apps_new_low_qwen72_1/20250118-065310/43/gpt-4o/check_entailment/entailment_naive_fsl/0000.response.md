Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using `itertools.product`.
   - Iterates through each generated binary string and checks if it contains `s` as a cyclic substring using the helper function `is_cyclic_substring`.
   - Counts and returns the number of such binary strings.

2. **Function `is_cyclic_substring`**:
   - Extends the binary string `t` by concatenating it with itself (`t + t`).
   - Checks if `s` is a substring of the extended string within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters to account for all possible cyclic shifts.

The approach ensures that all possible cyclic shifts are considered, and the program correctly counts the number of distinct cyclical binary strings that contain `s` as a substring. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would make the program incorrect. Therefore, the program is correct.
