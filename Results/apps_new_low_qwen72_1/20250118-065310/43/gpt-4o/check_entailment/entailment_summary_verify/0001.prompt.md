You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.

-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, s):

    from itertools import product
    all_binary_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('01', repeat=n)]
    count = 0
    for t in all_binary_strings:
        if is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
    t_extended = t + t
    return s in t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `is_cyclic_substring` takes two parameters: `t`, a binary string of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40), and `s`, a binary string of length between 1 and `n` inclusive. It returns `True` if `s` is a cyclic substring of `t`, meaning `s` can be found within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of the concatenated string `t + t`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles cases where `s` is a substring of `t` or a cyclic permutation of `t`. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases where `t` or `s` might be empty strings, although the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 40 and the length of `s` being between 1 and `n`) imply that these edge cases should not occur.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  

The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `is_cyclic_substring`. The function `func_1` generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using the `itertools.product` function, and then checks each generated string to see if it contains the string `s` as a cyclic substring using the `is_cyclic_substring` function.

The `is_cyclic_substring` function works by concatenating the string `t` with itself (`t + t`) to handle the cyclic nature of the problem. It then checks if `s` is a substring of the concatenated string within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters, which is sufficient to cover all possible cyclic shifts of `t`.

However, there is a potential issue with the `is_cyclic_substring` function. The slicing `t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]` might not always correctly capture all possible cyclic shifts of `t` when checking for the presence of `s`. Specifically, if `s` is a substring that spans the boundary of the concatenated string, the slicing might cut off part of the necessary characters.

To fix this, we should instead check if `s` is a substring of the entire concatenated string `t + t` without any slicing. This ensures that all possible cyclic shifts are considered.

Given this, the current implementation is not fully correct because it may miss some valid cyclic substrings due to the slicing issue.

Correctness: **False**
