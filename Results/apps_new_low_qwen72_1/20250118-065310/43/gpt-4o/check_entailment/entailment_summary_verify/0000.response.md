Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Generating All Binary Strings**: The function uses `itertools.product` to generate all possible binary strings of length `n`. This is a correct and efficient way to generate all combinations of binary strings of a given length.
   - **Iterating and Checking Cyclic Substrings**: For each generated binary string, it calls `is_cyclic_substring` to check if `s` is a cyclic substring. If it is, it increments the count. This part is also implemented correctly.
   - **Returning the Count**: Finally, it returns the count of binary strings that contain `s` as a cyclic substring. This is the desired output as per the problem statement.

2. **Function `is_cyclic_substring`**:
   - **Extending the String**: The function extends the binary string `t` by concatenating it with itself (`t + t`). This is a common technique to handle cyclic shifts without explicitly generating all possible shifts.
   - **Substring Check**: It then checks if `s` is a substring of the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of the extended string. This range is chosen because it covers all possible positions where `s` could appear in any cyclic shift of `t`. The function correctly handles the cyclic nature of the problem.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function summary mentions that it does not explicitly handle empty strings, but the problem constraints ensure that both `t` and `s` will always have valid lengths (1 ≤ n ≤ 40 and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n).

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints.
   - The logic and implementation are sound and cover all necessary cases.
   - The use of `itertools.product` and the cyclic substring check are appropriate and efficient for the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
