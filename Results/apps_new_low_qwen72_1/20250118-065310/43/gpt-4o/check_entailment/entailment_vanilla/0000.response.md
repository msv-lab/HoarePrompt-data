Reasoning:  

The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `is_cyclic_substring`. The function `func_1` generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using the `itertools.product` function, and then checks each generated string to see if it contains the string `s` as a cyclic substring using the `is_cyclic_substring` function.

The `is_cyclic_substring` function works by concatenating the string `t` with itself (`t + t`) to handle the cyclic nature of the problem. It then checks if `s` is a substring of the concatenated string within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters, which is sufficient to cover all possible cyclic shifts of `t`.

However, there is a potential issue with the `is_cyclic_substring` function. The slicing `t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]` might not always correctly capture all possible cyclic shifts of `t` when checking for the presence of `s`. Specifically, if `s` is a substring that spans the boundary of the concatenated string, the slicing might cut off part of the necessary characters.

To fix this, we should instead check if `s` is a substring of the entire concatenated string `t + t` without any slicing. This ensures that all possible cyclic shifts are considered.

Given this, the current implementation is not fully correct because it may miss some valid cyclic substrings due to the slicing issue.

Correctness: **False**
