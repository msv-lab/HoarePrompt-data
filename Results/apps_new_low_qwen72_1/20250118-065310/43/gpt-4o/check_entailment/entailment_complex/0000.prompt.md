Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.

-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

# Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
s = input()
print(func_1(n, s))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, s is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n.
def func_1(n, s):
    all_binary_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('01', repeat=n)]

count = 0
    for t in all_binary_strings:
        if is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \), `s` is a binary string of length \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \), `all_binary_strings` is a list of all binary strings of length \( n \). The variable `count` is the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`. Here, `all_binary_strings` is a list of all binary strings of length `n`, and `s` is a binary string of length between 1 and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and `s` (a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n). It generates all possible binary strings of length `n` and counts how many of these strings are cyclic substrings of `s`. The function returns the total count of such binary strings. If `s` is an empty string or `n` is 0, the function will return 0. If `n` is greater than 40 or less than 1, the behavior is undefined and may result in errors or incorrect results.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a binary string of length n, s is a binary string of length between 1 and n inclusive, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40.
def is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
    t_extended = t + t
    return s in t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns True if the binary string `s` is a substring of the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of `t_extended`, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `is_cyclic_substring` takes two parameters: `t`, a binary string of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40), and `s`, a binary string of length between 1 and `n` inclusive. It returns `True` if `s` is a cyclic substring of `t`, meaning `s` can be found within the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of the concatenated string `t + t`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles cases where `s` is a substring of `t` or a cyclic permutation of `t`. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases where `t` or `s` might be empty strings, although the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 40 and the length of `s` being between 1 and `n`) imply that these edge cases should not occur.
