Reasoning:

The program aims to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length \( n \) that contain the binary string \( s \) as a substring. The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `is_cyclic_substring`.

1. **`func_1(n, s)`**:
   - Generates all possible binary strings of length \( n \).
   - Counts how many of these strings contain \( s \) as a cyclic substring using the helper function `is_cyclic_substring`.
   - Returns the count.

2. **`is_cyclic_substring(t, s)`**:
   - Concatenates the string \( t \) with itself to form \( t + t \).
   - Checks if \( s \) is a substring of the first \( n + \text{len}(s) - 1 \) characters of \( t + t \).
   - Returns `True` if \( s \) is found, otherwise `False`.

### Analysis:

- **Generating All Binary Strings**:
  - The function `func_1` uses `itertools.product` to generate all binary strings of length \( n \). This is correct and efficient for the given constraint \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \).

- **Cyclic Substring Check**:
  - The function `is_cyclic_substring` correctly checks if \( s \) is a cyclic substring of \( t \) by concatenating \( t \) with itself and checking the first \( n + \text{len}(s) - 1 \) characters. This approach ensures that all possible cyclic shifts of \( t \) are considered.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The problem constraints ensure that \( n \) is within the valid range and \( s \) is a non-empty string of length between 1 and \( n \). Therefore, the program does not need to handle edge cases like empty strings or invalid \( n \).

- **Correctness of Output**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length \( n \) that contain \( s \) as a substring. The examples provided in the problem statement are consistent with the expected output of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem description and handles all valid inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
