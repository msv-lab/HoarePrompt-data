Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using `itertools.product`.
   - It then iterates over these strings and checks if each one contains `s` as a cyclic substring using the `is_cyclic_substring` function.
   - The count of such strings is returned.

2. **Function `is_cyclic_substring`**:
   - This function checks if `s` is a cyclic substring of `t` by concatenating `t` with itself (`t + t`) and checking if `s` is a substring of the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of this concatenated string.
   - This approach correctly handles cyclic permutations because any cyclic permutation of `t` will appear as a substring in `t + t`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 40 and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n) ensure that `t` and `s` are non-empty, so the functions do not need to handle empty strings explicitly.
   - The constraints also ensure that `n` is within a valid range, so the behavior is well-defined.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads `n` and `s` from the input, calls `func_1` with these values, and prints the result.
   - The logic in both functions is consistent with the problem description and the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
