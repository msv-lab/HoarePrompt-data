Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.


-----Examples-----

10101010101010

Output
962


-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input())
s = input()
print(func_1(n, s))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, s is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n.
def func_1(n, s):
    all_binary_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('01', repeat=n)]

count = 0
    for t in all_binary_strings:
        if is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \), `s` is a binary string of length \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \), `all_binary_strings` is a list of all binary strings of length \( n \). The variable `count` is the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of binary strings in `all_binary_strings` that are cyclic substrings of `s`. Here, `all_binary_strings` is a list of all binary strings of length `n`, and `s` is a binary string of length between 1 and `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a binary string of length n, s is a binary string of length between 1 and n inclusive, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40.
def is_cyclic_substring(t, s):
    t_extended = t + t
    return s in t_extended[:n + len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns True if the binary string `s` is a substring of the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of `t_extended`, otherwise it returns False.
