Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, with `n` being an integer within the specified range and `s` being a binary string of appropriate length.

2. **Generating All Binary Strings**: The program generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using the `product` function from the `itertools` module. This is done correctly, ensuring that all possible combinations of '0' and '1' of length `n` are considered.

3. **Cyclic Substring Check**: The function `is_cyclic_substring` checks if `s` is a substring of any cyclic shift of `t`. It does this by extending `t` to `t + t` and checking if `s` is a substring of the first `n + len(s) - 1` characters of the extended string. This approach is correct because it covers all possible cyclic shifts of `t` that could contain `s` as a substring.

4. **Counting Valid Strings**: The program correctly counts the number of binary strings `t` that contain `s` as a cyclic substring by iterating over all generated binary strings and using the `is_cyclic_substring` function.

5. **Output**: The final count is returned and printed, which should be the correct number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length `n` that contain `s` as a substring.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
