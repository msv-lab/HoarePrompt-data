Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `r` are integers where `r` is the remainder of `n` divided by `m`. If `r` is 0, the program does nothing. If `r` is not 0, and `m - r` is less than or equal to `n`, the minimum value between `(m - r) * a` and `r * b` is printed. If `m - r` is greater than `n`, the value of `(m - r) * a` is printed.***
