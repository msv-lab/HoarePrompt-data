The code snippet `print(min((m - r) * a, r * b))` calculates the minimum value between `(m - r) * a` and `r * b` and prints it. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `m` is the second integer from input.
- `a` is the third integer from input.
- `b` is the fourth integer from input.
- `r` is the remainder of `n` divided by `m`.
- `r` is not equal to 0.
- The current value of `m - r` is less than or equal to `n`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `r` remain unchanged by the print statement. The only effect of the code is to print the minimum value between `(m - r) * a` and `r * b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `a` is the third integer from input, `b` is the fourth integer from input, `r` is the remainder of `n` divided by `m`, `r` is not equal to 0, the current value of `m - r` is less than or equal to `n`, and the minimum value between `(m - r) * a` and `r * b` is printed.**
