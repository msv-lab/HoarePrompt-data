Functionality: ** The function reads four integers `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`. It calculates the remainder `r` of `n` divided by `m`. If `r` is 0, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it checks if `m - r` is less than or equal to `n`. If true, it prints the minimum value between `(m - r) * a` and `r * b`. If `m - r` is greater than `n`, it prints `(m - r) * a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly divisible by `m` (i.e., `r = 0`), and when `m - r` is greater than `n`, which could occur if `n` is very small compared to `m`. The function does not handle invalid input or non-integer inputs, which could lead to runtime errors. **
