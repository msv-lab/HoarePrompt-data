The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function expects four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are integers. The constraints for these parameters are as follows: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. The description of the output is missing, but typically, the function would process these parameters in some way and return a result based on their values.

Since the specific output is not provided, I cannot accurately describe the return value. However, if we assume that the function processes these parameters and returns a result (commonly another integer or a boolean), the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are integers within specified ranges (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). It processes these parameters and returns a result based on their values.** 

If you provide the specific output behavior, I can refine this description further.
