#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, and each integer in lst is such that 1 ≤ lst[i] ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, where each integer satisfies \(1 \leq \text{lst}[i] \leq 10^6\). `gcd_result` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `lst`. If `lst` has only one element, `gcd_result` remains the first element of `lst`. The variable `num` is not defined outside the loop.
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns `gcd_result`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `lst`. If `lst` has only one element, `gcd_result` is that single element. Each element in `lst` satisfies \(1 \leq \text{lst}[i] \leq 10^6\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^6\). It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `lst`. If `lst` contains only one element, it returns that single element. The function does not modify the input list `lst`. If the input list is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access `lst[0]` without checking if the list is empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer.
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x`, and the loop condition `i < int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` no longer holds true, meaning `i` has exceeded `int(math.sqrt(x))`. The variable `i` is not explicitly stored after the loop, but it would have iterated through all values from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))` inclusive. The set `divisors` contains pairs `(i, x // i)` for each `i` where `x % i == 0`.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of all divisors of `x`, including both `i` and `x // i` for each `i` where `x % i == 0`, in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `x` in descending order. It correctly identifies all divisors by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` and adding both the divisor and its corresponding quotient to a set. The function ensures that the returned list is sorted in descending order. Edge cases such as when `x` is 1 (where the only divisor is 1) or when `x` is a prime number (where the only divisors are 1 and `x` itself) are handled correctly.
