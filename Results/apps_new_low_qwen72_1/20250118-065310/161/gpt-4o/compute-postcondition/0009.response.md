The provided code adds the current value of `i` and the result of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. Given that `i` is 3, both `i` and `x // i` are added to `divisors`.

Since the initial state specifies that `divisors` can be either `{1, x}` or `{1, x, 2, x // 2}`, and `i` is 3, the new elements added to `divisors` will be 3 and `x // 3`.

- If `divisors` was initially `{1, x}`, it becomes `{1, x, 3, x // 3}`.
- If `divisors` was initially `{1, x, 2, x // 2}`, it becomes `{1, x, 2, x // 2, 3, x // 3}`.

The value of `i` remains 3, and `x` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, with the condition that `3 < int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` still holding true.

Output State: **x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, divisors is {1, x, 3, x // 3} if initially {1, x}, or divisors is {1, x, 2, x // 2, 3, x // 3} if initially {1, x, 2, x // 2}, i is 3, and 3 < int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
