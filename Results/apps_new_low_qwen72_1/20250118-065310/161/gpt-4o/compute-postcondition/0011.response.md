Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x`, and the loop condition `i < int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` no longer holds true, meaning `i` has exceeded `int(math.sqrt(x))`. The variable `i` is not explicitly stored after the loop, but it would have iterated through all values from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))` inclusive. The set `divisors` contains pairs `(i, x // i)` for each `i` where `x % i == 0`.**
