The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. The loop condition is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` becomes 2 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, `i` is now 2, and `x` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `divisors` is {1, x}, and `i` is 2. `x` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is greater than or equal to 2.**
