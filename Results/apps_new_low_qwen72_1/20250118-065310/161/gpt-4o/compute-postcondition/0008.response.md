The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust these. The loop condition is `i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1)`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `divisors` is either {1, x} or {1, x, 2, x // 2} depending on whether `x % i == 0` was true, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `x` must still satisfy the condition that `3 < int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `divisors` is either {1, x} or {1, x, 2, x // 2}, and `i` is 3. `x` must be such that `3 < int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.**
