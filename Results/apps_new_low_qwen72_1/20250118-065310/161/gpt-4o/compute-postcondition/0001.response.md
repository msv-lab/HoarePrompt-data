To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop will start its first iteration.

### Given:
- `x` is a positive integer.
- `divisors` is an empty set.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `x`.
2. **Range Condition**: The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` (exclusive).
3. **First Iteration**: For the loop to execute its first iteration, the range must contain at least one value. This means that the upper bound of the range, `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, must be greater than the lower bound, which is 1.

### Conditions for the First Iteration:
- The upper bound of the range, `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, must be greater than 1.
- This translates to `int(math.sqrt(x)) >= 1`.

### Simplifying the Condition:
- `int(math.sqrt(x)) >= 1` implies that `math.sqrt(x) >= 1`.
- Since `math.sqrt(x)` is the square root of `x`, this further simplifies to `x >= 1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be at least 1. Additionally, `i` will be 1 during the first iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `divisors` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
