The provided code adds two elements to the set `divisors`: the value of `i` and the result of `x // i`. Given that `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` starts at 2, we can determine the following:

- Initially, `divisors` contains {1, x}.
- The first line adds `i` (which is 2) to `divisors`.
- The second line adds the integer division result of `x` divided by `i` (which is `x // 2`) to `divisors`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the set `divisors` will contain at least the elements 1, x, 2, and `x // 2`.

Output State: **x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, divisors is {1, x, 2, x // 2}, i is 2**
