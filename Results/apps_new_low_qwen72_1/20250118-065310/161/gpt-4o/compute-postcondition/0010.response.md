Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 3. If `x % i == 0`, then `divisors` is updated to {1, x, 3, x // 3} if initially {1, x}, or `divisors` is updated to {1, x, 2, x // 2, 3, x // 3} if initially {1, x, 2, x // 2}. Additionally, 3 < int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1 remains true. If `x % i != 0`, `divisors` and other variables remain unchanged.***
