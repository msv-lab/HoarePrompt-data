The provided code adds two elements to the set `divisors`: the current value of `i` and the result of `x // i`. Given the initial state, where `i` is 1 and `x % i` is 0 (meaning `i` is a divisor of `x`), the following occurs:

- The first line adds `i` (which is 1) to the `divisors` set.
- The second line adds `x // i` (which is `x` since `i` is 1) to the `divisors` set.

Therefore, the `divisors` set now contains the numbers 1 and `x`.

Output State: **x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, divisors is {1, x}, i is 1**
