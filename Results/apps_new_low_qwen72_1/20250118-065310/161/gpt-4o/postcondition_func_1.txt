The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `x` in descending order. It correctly identifies all divisors by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` and adding both the divisor and its corresponding quotient to a set. The function ensures that the returned list is sorted in descending order. Edge cases such as when `x` is 1 (where the only divisor is 1) or when `x` is a prime number (where the only divisors are 1 and `x` itself) are handled correctly.
