Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `N`, `K`, and the list `A` from standard input.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the list `A` (`sum_A`). This is necessary because any operation performed on the list does not change the total sum. The sum is invariant under the operation of adding 1 to one element and subtracting 1 from another.

3. **Initial GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` computes the GCD of the initial list `A`. This is done using the `math.gcd` function iteratively over the list. This is correct and ensures that the GCD of the initial list is calculated.

4. **Divisors Calculation**: The function `func_2` generates all divisors of `sum_A` and returns them in descending order. This is done by iterating up to the square root of `sum_A` and checking for divisibility. The divisors are added to a set to ensure uniqueness and then returned as a sorted list in descending order. This is correct and ensures that all possible divisors are considered.

5. **Main Logic**: The main part of the program iterates over the divisors of `sum_A` in descending order. For each divisor `d`, it checks if it is possible to make all elements of `A` divisible by `d` within the allowed number of operations `K`. The check is done using the condition `all((a % d == 0 or (sum_A - a) % d <= K for a in A))`. This condition ensures that either the element is already divisible by `d` or the difference needed to make it divisible is within the allowed operations.

6. **Output**: If a valid divisor is found, it is printed and the program exits. If no valid divisor is found, the program implicitly ends without printing anything (though this case should not occur given the constraints and the nature of the problem).

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and follows the problem requirements correctly.

Correctness: **True**
