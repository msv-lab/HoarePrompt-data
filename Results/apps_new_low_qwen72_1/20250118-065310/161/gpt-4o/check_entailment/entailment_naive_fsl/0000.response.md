Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The problem requires performing operations to maximize the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array elements after a certain number of allowed operations. However, the program only defines helper functions:

1. `func_1` calculates the GCD of all elements in the list, which is a step in the right direction but does not account for the operations allowed.
2. `func_2` finds all divisors of a given number, which is also useful but not directly related to the main task of maximizing the GCD after operations.

The program is missing the core logic to handle the operations and determine the maximum possible GCD after performing up to K operations. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

A correct solution would need to consider how to use the allowed operations to balance the array elements and maximize the GCD. This typically involves redistributing values in the array to make them as equal as possible, given the constraints.
