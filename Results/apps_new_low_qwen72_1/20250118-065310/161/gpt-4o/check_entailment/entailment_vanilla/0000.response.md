Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible positive integer that can divide every element of the array \( A \) after performing up to \( K \) operations. The key insight here is that the operations do not change the sum of the elements in the array. Therefore, the GCD of the elements after the operations must also be a divisor of the sum of the elements before the operations.

### Steps to Verify the Program:

1. **Calculate the GCD of the Initial Array:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the GCD of the initial array using the `math.gcd` function. This is correct because the GCD of the array will be the largest number that can divide all elements of the array.

2. **Find All Divisors of the GCD:**
   - The function `func_2` finds all divisors of the GCD and returns them in descending order. This is correct because the maximum possible divisor that can divide all elements after the operations must be one of the divisors of the initial GCD.

3. **Check Feasibility of Each Divisor:**
   - The main logic should check each divisor from the largest to the smallest to see if it is possible to make all elements of the array divisible by this divisor after at most \( K \) operations. This step is not explicitly shown in the provided code, but it is necessary to ensure correctness.

### Missing Step:
The provided code does not include the logic to check the feasibility of each divisor. This is crucial because not all divisors of the GCD can necessarily be achieved within the given constraints of \( K \) operations.

### Corrected Approach:
1. Calculate the GCD of the initial array.
2. Find all divisors of the GCD.
3. For each divisor, starting from the largest:
   - Check if it is possible to make all elements of the array divisible by this divisor using at most \( K \) operations.
   - If possible, return this divisor.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete because it lacks the logic to check the feasibility of each divisor. Therefore, the program as given is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
