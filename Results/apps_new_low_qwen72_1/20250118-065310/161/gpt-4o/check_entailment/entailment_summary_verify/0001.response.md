Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code is incomplete and lacks the crucial step of checking the feasibility of each divisor. However, let's break down the reasoning more thoroughly to ensure we understand why the code is indeed incorrect.

### Key Points:

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of the initial array using the `math.gcd` function. This is essential because the GCD of the array elements will be the largest number that can potentially divide all elements of the array after the operations.

2. **Finding Divisors:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly finds all divisors of the GCD and returns them in descending order. This is important because the maximum possible divisor that can divide all elements after the operations must be one of these divisors.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The main logic to check the feasibility of each divisor is missing. This step is crucial because not all divisors of the GCD can be achieved within the given constraints of \( K \) operations. For each divisor, we need to check if it is possible to make all elements of the array divisible by this divisor using at most \( K \) operations.

### Missing Logic:

The missing logic involves the following steps:
1. For each divisor, starting from the largest:
   - Calculate the total number of operations required to make all elements of the array divisible by this divisor.
   - If the total number of operations required is less than or equal to \( K \), return this divisor as the answer.
   - If no such divisor is found, continue to the next smaller divisor.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the sample input:
```
2 3
8 20
```
1. **Initial GCD Calculation:**
   - GCD of [8, 20] is 4.
2. **Divisors of GCD:**
   - Divisors of 4 are [4, 2, 1].
3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - For divisor 4:
     - Operations required to make 8 and 20 divisible by 4:
       - 8 is already divisible by 4.
       - 20 is already divisible by 4.
     - Total operations required: 0 (which is <= 3).
     - Return 4 as the answer.

However, the provided code does not include the feasibility check, which means it cannot determine the correct answer for the given input.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the missing logic. The provided code is incomplete and lacks the crucial step of checking the feasibility of each divisor. Therefore, the program as given is not correct.

Final: **False**
