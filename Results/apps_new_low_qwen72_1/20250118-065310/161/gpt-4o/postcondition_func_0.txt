The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^6\). It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `lst`. If `lst` contains only one element, it returns that single element. The function does not modify the input list `lst`. If the input list is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access `lst[0]` without checking if the list is empty.
