The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the absolute difference between the frequencies of the integer `1` in lists `a` and `b`. Specifically, `count_a[i]` and `count_b[i]` represent the frequencies of the integer `1` in `a` and `b`, respectively, since `i` is initially set to `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\)
- `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\)
- `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`
- `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1])`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1])`, `i` is 1**.
