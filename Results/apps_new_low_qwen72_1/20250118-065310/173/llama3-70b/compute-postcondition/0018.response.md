The only variables in the loop head are `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to 6 (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1])`, `i` is 2**.
