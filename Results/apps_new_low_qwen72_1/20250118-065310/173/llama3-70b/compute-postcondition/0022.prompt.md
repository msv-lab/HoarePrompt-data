Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This initialization does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `count_a`, or `count_b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is 0.**
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, 6):
    ans += abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i])


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the absolute difference between the frequencies of the integer `1` in lists `a` and `b`. Specifically, `count_a[i]` and `count_b[i]` represent the frequencies of the integer `1` in `a` and `b`, respectively, since `i` is initially set to `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\)
- `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\)
- `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`
- `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1])`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1])`, `i` is 1**.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the absolute difference between the frequencies of the integer `i` (which is 2) in lists `a` and `b`. The value of `ans` was initially set to `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1])`. After executing the given code, `ans` is updated to `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1]) + abs(count_a[2] - count_b[2])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1]) + abs(count_a[2] - count_b[2])`, `i` is 2**.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1]) + abs(count_a[2] - count_b[2]) + abs(count_a[3] - count_b[3])`, `i` is 3


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
