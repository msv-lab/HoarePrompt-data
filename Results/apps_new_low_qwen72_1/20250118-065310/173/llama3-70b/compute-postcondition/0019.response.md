The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the absolute difference between the frequencies of the integer `i` (which is 2) in lists `a` and `b`. The value of `ans` was initially set to `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1])`. After executing the given code, `ans` is updated to `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1]) + abs(count_a[2] - count_b[2])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1]) + abs(count_a[2] - count_b[2])`, `i` is 2**.
