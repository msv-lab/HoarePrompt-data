Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5, b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 5, count_a is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], count_b is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    count_a[i] += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated with `count_a[i]` being incremented by 1, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` is the first element of `a`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The code `count_a[i] += 1` increments the value of `count_a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is the second element of `a`, and `count_a[i]` is being incremented, the value of `i` is `a[1]`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `i` is the second element of `a`, which means `i = a[1]`.
- `count_a[i]` is incremented by 1.
- Since `i` is an index in `count_a`, and `i` is one of the elements in `a`, the value of `count_a[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `count_b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated with `count_a[a[1]]` being incremented by 1, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` is the second element of `a`**.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated with `count_a[a[1]]` being incremented by 1 and `count_a[a[2]]` being incremented by 1, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` is the third element of `a`


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
