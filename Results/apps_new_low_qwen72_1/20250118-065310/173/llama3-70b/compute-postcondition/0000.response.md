The provided code initializes two lists, `count_a` and `count_b`, each with 6 elements set to 0. These lists are intended to count occurrences of integers from 1 to 5 in the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. However, the code snippet does not actually populate these count lists based on the contents of `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 5

After executing the provided code snippet, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new variables `count_a` and `count_b` are initialized as lists of 6 zeros each.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5, b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 5, count_a is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], count_b is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**
