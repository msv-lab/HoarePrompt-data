Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1]) + abs(count_a[2] - count_b[2]) + abs(count_a[3] - count_b[3]) + abs(count_a[4] - count_b[4]) + abs(count_a[5] - count_b[5])`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to 5 (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, the loop updates the variable `ans` by adding the absolute difference between the counts of the current integer `i` in `a` and `b`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `ans` is updated in each iteration.
   - `count_a` and `count_b` are invariant within the loop; they do not change once initialized.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are also invariant; they remain unchanged throughout the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates 5 times, once for each integer from 1 to 5.
   - In each iteration, the absolute difference between the frequency of the current integer in `a` and `b` is added to `ans`.
   - The final value of `ans` is the sum of these absolute differences for all integers from 1 to 5.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.
   - The loop will always execute 5 times, regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, because the range is fixed from 1 to 5.

Thus, after the loop completes, the final value of `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the frequencies of integers 1 through 5 in the lists `a` and `b`.
