Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`. The loop will execute exactly `n` times if `b` contains `n` elements, updating `count_b` accordingly. If `b` is empty, the loop will not execute and `count_b` will remain `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.**
