Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, where each integer is between 1 and 5. It then calculates the total number of changes required to make the frequency of each integer in `a` match the frequency of the same integer in `b`. This is done by computing the sum of the absolute differences between the frequencies of each integer in `a` and `b`, and then dividing the result by 2. The function prints this value. The function assumes that `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and that both `a` and `b` contain exactly `n` integers. If the input lists are not of the expected length or contain invalid integers, the function's behavior is undefined. **
