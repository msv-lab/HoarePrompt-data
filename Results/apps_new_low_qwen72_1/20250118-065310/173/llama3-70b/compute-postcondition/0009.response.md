The value of `count_b` at index `i` (where `i` is the first element in `b`) is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[i]` is 1, `i` is the first element in `b`**.
