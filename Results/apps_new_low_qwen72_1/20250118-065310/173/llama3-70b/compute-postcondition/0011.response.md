The code snippet `count_b[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `count_b` by 1. Given that `i` is the second element in `b`, and initially `count_b[i]` is 1 (as per the initial state), after the increment, `count_b[i]` will be 2.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\)
- `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\)
- `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`
- `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[i]` is 2, where `i` is the second element in `b`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[i]` is 2, where `i` is the second element in `b`**
