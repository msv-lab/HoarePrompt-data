The code snippet `count_b[i] += 1` increments the value of `count_b[i]` by 1, where `i` is the next element in `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\).
- `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\).
- `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`.
- `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[i]` is 2, where `i` is the second element in `b`.
- `i` is the next element in `b`.

After executing `count_b[i] += 1`:
- The value of `count_b[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the next element in `b`, and initially `count_b[i]` is 2 (if `i` was the second element in `b`), `count_b[i]` becomes 3.

The output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\).
- `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\).
- `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`.
- `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[i]` is 3, where `i` is the next element in `b`.
- `i` is the next element in `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[i]` is 3, where `i` is the next element in `b`, `i` is the next element in `b`.**
