The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are elements left in `a`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated with `count_a[i]` being incremented by 1, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` is the second element of `a`**
