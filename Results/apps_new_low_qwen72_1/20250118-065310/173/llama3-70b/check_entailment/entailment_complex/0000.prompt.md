Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 5.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

count_a = [0] * 6

count_b = [0] * 6
    for i in a:
        count_a[i] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    for i in b:
        count_b[i] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`. The loop will execute exactly `n` times if `b` contains `n` elements, updating `count_b` accordingly. If `b` is empty, the loop will not execute and `count_b` will remain `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        ans += abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5\), `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 5\), `count_a` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`, `count_b` is a list where each index \(i\) (1 through 5) reflects the frequency of integer \(i\) in `b`, `ans` is `abs(count_a[1] - count_b[1]) + abs(count_a[2] - count_b[2]) + abs(count_a[3] - count_b[3]) + abs(count_a[4] - count_b[4]) + abs(count_a[5] - count_b[5])`.
    print(ans // 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, where each integer is between 1 and 5. It then calculates the total number of changes required to make the frequency of each integer in `a` match the frequency of the same integer in `b`. This is done by computing the sum of the absolute differences between the frequencies of each integer in `a` and `b`, and then dividing the result by 2. The function prints this value. The function assumes that `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and that both `a` and `b` contain exactly `n` integers. If the input lists are not of the expected length or contain invalid integers, the function's behavior is undefined.
