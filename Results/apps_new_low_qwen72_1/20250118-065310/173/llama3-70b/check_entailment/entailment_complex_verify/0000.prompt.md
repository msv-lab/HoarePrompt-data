You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

The loop will execute exactly `n` times if `b` contains `n` elements, updating `count_b` accordingly. If `b` is empty, the loop will not execute and `count_b` will remain `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, where each integer is between 1 and 5. It then calculates the total number of changes required to make the frequency of each integer in `a` match the frequency of the same integer in `b`. This is done by computing the sum of the absolute differences between the frequencies of each integer in `a` and `b`, and then dividing the result by 2. The function prints this value. The function assumes that `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and that both `a` and `b` contain exactly `n` integers. If the input lists are not of the expected length or contain invalid integers, the function's behavior is undefined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input values correctly, including the number of students `n` and the academic performance lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Academic Performances**: It initializes two lists `count_a` and `count_b` to keep track of the count of each academic performance (from 1 to 5) in groups A and B, respectively. This is done using a loop to iterate over the lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Calculating Exchanges**: The program then calculates the total number of mismatches between the counts of each academic performance in the two groups. This is done by summing the absolute differences between the counts of each performance level.

4. **Dividing by 2**: Since each exchange involves swapping one student from group A with one student from group B, the total number of exchanges needed is half of the total mismatches (`ans // 2`).

5. **Output**: The program prints the result, which is the minimum number of exchanges required.

The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including cases where the desired distribution is impossible (which would result in an odd number of mismatches, making the division by 2 impossible without a remainder). However, the program correctly handles these cases by printing the integer division result, which will be a valid number of exchanges or -1 if the distribution is impossible.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
