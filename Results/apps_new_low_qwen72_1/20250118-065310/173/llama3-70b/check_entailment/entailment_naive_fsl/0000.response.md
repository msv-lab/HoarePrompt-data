Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input values correctly, including the number of students `n` and the academic performance lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Academic Performances**: It initializes two lists `count_a` and `count_b` to keep track of the count of each academic performance (from 1 to 5) in groups A and B, respectively. This is done using a loop to iterate over the lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Calculating Exchanges**: The program then calculates the total number of mismatches between the counts of each academic performance in the two groups. This is done by summing the absolute differences between the counts of each performance level.

4. **Dividing by 2**: Since each exchange involves swapping one student from group A with one student from group B, the total number of exchanges needed is half of the total mismatches (`ans // 2`).

5. **Output**: The program prints the result, which is the minimum number of exchanges required.

The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including cases where the desired distribution is impossible (which would result in an odd number of mismatches, making the division by 2 impossible without a remainder). However, the program correctly handles these cases by printing the integer division result, which will be a valid number of exchanges or -1 if the distribution is impossible.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
