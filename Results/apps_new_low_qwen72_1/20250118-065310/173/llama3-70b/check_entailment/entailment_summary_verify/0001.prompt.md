You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count_a = [0] * 6
    count_b = [0] * 6
    for i in a:
        count_a[i] += 1
    for i in b:
        count_b[i] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        ans += abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i])
    print(ans // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, where each integer is between 1 and 5. It then calculates the total number of changes required to make the frequency of each integer in `a` match the frequency of the same integer in `b`. This is done by computing the sum of the absolute differences between the frequencies of each integer in `a` and `b`, and then dividing the result by 2. The function prints this value. The function assumes that `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and that both `a` and `b` contain exactly `n` integers. If the input lists are not of the expected length or contain invalid integers, the function's behavior is undefined.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program aims to find the minimum number of exchanges required to make the distribution of academic performances equal between two groups. The approach taken by the program is to:

1. Read the number of students `n` in each group.
2. Read the academic performance lists for both groups `a` and `b`.
3. Count the occurrences of each academic performance in both groups using `count_a` and `count_b`.
4. Calculate the total difference in counts for each academic performance between the two groups.
5. Since each exchange balances out one difference on both sides, the total number of exchanges needed is half of the total difference.

The logic is sound and follows the requirements of the problem statement. However, there is one edge case that needs to be considered: if it is impossible to achieve the desired distribution (e.g., when the total number of students with a particular academic performance is odd), the program should return `-1`. The current program does not handle this case, which means it might return an incorrect result in such scenarios.

For example, consider the case where there are 3 students with academic performance 5 in total (2 in group A and 1 in group B). It's impossible to balance this because 3 is an odd number and cannot be evenly split between the two groups.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** due to its failure to handle the impossibility of achieving the desired distribution.

Correctness: **False**
