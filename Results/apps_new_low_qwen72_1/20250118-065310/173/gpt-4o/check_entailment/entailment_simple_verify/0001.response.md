Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Counting Performances**: The function initializes two lists `count_a` and `count_b` to count the occurrences of each performance level (1 to 5) in groups A and B, respectively. This is done using a loop that increments the corresponding index in the count lists. The annotated code confirms that these counts are correctly computed.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The function checks if the total number of students with each performance level across both groups is even. If any performance level has an odd total count, it is impossible to balance the groups, and the function prints `-1` and exits. This check is necessary because if the total count is odd, it is impossible to have an equal number of students with that performance level in both groups. The annotated code confirms that this check is correctly implemented.

4. **Calculating Exchanges**: For each performance level, the function calculates the absolute difference in counts between the two groups and divides it by 2 to get the number of exchanges needed to balance that performance level. The total number of exchanges is the sum of these values. The annotated code confirms that this calculation is correctly performed.

5. **Final Output**: The function prints the total number of exchanges needed. However, there is a small issue in the final calculation. The line `print(exchanges_needed // 2)` should be `print(exchanges_needed)` because the `diff` already accounts for the exchanges needed to balance each performance level. This is a minor error in the original program.

Given the annotations and the reasoning, the original assessment is correct in identifying the minor issue in the final output calculation. Correcting this issue would make the program fully correct.

Final: **False** (due to the minor issue in the final output calculation). 

However, if the final output is corrected as shown in the original assessment, the correctness would be **True**.
