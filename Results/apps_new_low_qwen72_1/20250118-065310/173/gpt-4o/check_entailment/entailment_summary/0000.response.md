Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It counts the occurrences of each performance score in both groups and then checks if the total number of each performance score across both groups is even. If any score has an odd total, it is impossible to balance the groups, and the program correctly outputs `-1`. If all scores have even totals, the program calculates the minimum number of exchanges needed to balance the groups by finding the absolute difference in counts of each score between the groups, dividing by 2 (since each exchange balances two scores), and summing these values.

However, there is a minor issue in the final calculation of `exchanges_needed`. The program divides the `diff` by 2 inside the loop, which is correct, but then it unnecessarily divides `exchanges_needed` by 2 again before printing it. This results in an incorrect output because the division by 2 is applied twice.

Here's the corrected version of the relevant part:

```python
    exchanges_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
        exchanges_needed += diff
    print(exchanges_needed)
```

Given the original program, the double division by 2 is incorrect and should be fixed. However, the overall logic and structure of the program are correct.

Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be adjusted to remove the unnecessary division by 2 in the final print statement. Once this is corrected, the program will correctly solve the problem.
