Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count_a = [0] * 6
    count_b = [0] * 6
    for performance in a:
        count_a[performance] += 1
    for performance in b:
        count_b[performance] += 1
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (count_a[i] + count_b[i]) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            exit()
    exchanges_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
        exchanges_needed += diff
    print(exchanges_needed // 2)





# Execution Summary:
The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of integers from the user. Each list `a` and `b` contains `n` integers, and each integer is between 1 and 5 inclusive. The function then counts the occurrences of each integer (from 1 to 5) in both lists `a` and `b`. It checks if the total count of each integer across both lists is even. If any of these totals is odd, the function prints `-1` and exits. If all totals are even, the function calculates the minimum number of swaps required to make the counts of each integer in `a` and `b` equal and prints this number. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which would result in empty lists, but this case is not handled in the code).
