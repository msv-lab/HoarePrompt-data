You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count_a = [0] * 6
    count_b = [0] * 6
    for performance in a:
        count_a[performance] += 1
    for performance in b:
        count_b[performance] += 1
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (count_a[i] + count_b[i]) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            exit()
    exchanges_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
        exchanges_needed += diff
    print(exchanges_needed // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of integers from the user. Each list `a` and `b` contains `n` integers, and each integer is between 1 and 5 inclusive. The function then counts the occurrences of each integer (from 1 to 5) in both lists `a` and `b`. It checks if the total count of each integer across both lists is even. If any of these totals is odd, the function prints `-1` and exits. If all totals are even, the function calculates the minimum number of swaps required to make the counts of each integer in `a` and `b` equal and prints this number. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which would result in empty lists, but this case is not handled in the code).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Counting Performances**: It initializes two lists `count_a` and `count_b` to count the occurrences of each performance level (1 to 5) in groups A and B, respectively. This is done using a loop that increments the corresponding index in the count lists.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The function checks if the total number of students with each performance level across both groups is even. If any performance level has an odd total count, it is impossible to balance the groups, and the function prints `-1` and exits. This check is necessary because if the total count is odd, it is impossible to have an equal number of students with that performance level in both groups.

4. **Calculating Exchanges**: For each performance level, the function calculates the absolute difference in counts between the two groups and divides it by 2 to get the number of exchanges needed to balance that performance level. The total number of exchanges is the sum of these values.

5. **Final Output**: The function prints the total number of exchanges needed. However, there is a small issue in the final calculation. The line `print(exchanges_needed // 2)` should be `print(exchanges_needed)` because the `diff` already accounts for the exchanges needed to balance each performance level.

Given this, the program is almost correct, but the final output should be adjusted to avoid dividing by 2 again.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count_a = [0] * 6
    count_b = [0] * 6
    for performance in a:
        count_a[performance] += 1
    for performance in b:
        count_b[performance] += 1
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (count_a[i] + count_b[i]) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            return
    exchanges_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
        exchanges_needed += diff
    print(exchanges_needed)
```

Correctness: **False** (due to the minor issue in the final output calculation). 

However, if the final output is corrected as shown above, the correctness would be **True**.
