### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` from the input. Each list contains `n` integers representing the academic performance of students in groups A and B, respectively.

2. **Counting Performances**:
   - The function initializes two lists `count_a` and `count_b` to count the occurrences of each performance level (1 to 5) in groups A and B, respectively. This is done using a loop that increments the corresponding index in the count lists.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The function checks if the total number of students with each performance level across both groups is even. If any performance level has an odd total count, it is impossible to balance the groups, and the function prints `-1` and exits. This check is necessary because if the total count is odd, it is impossible to have an equal number of students with that performance level in both groups.

4. **Calculating Exchanges**:
   - For each performance level, the function calculates the absolute difference in counts between the two groups and divides it by 2 to get the number of exchanges needed to balance that performance level. The total number of exchanges is the sum of these values.
   - The line `print(exchanges_needed // 2)` is indeed incorrect. The variable `exchanges_needed` already accounts for the number of exchanges needed to balance each performance level, so dividing it by 2 again is unnecessary.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function should print `exchanges_needed` directly without the additional division by 2.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count_a = [0] * 6
    count_b = [0] * 6
    for performance in a:
        count_a[performance] += 1
    for performance in b:
        count_b[performance] += 1
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (count_a[i] + count_b[i]) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            return
    exchanges_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
        exchanges_needed += diff
    print(exchanges_needed)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the final output calculation.
- The corrected program, as provided in the original assessment, is correct.

Final: **True** (after correcting the final output calculation).
