Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Counting Performances**: It initializes two lists `count_a` and `count_b` to count the occurrences of each performance level (1 to 5) in groups A and B, respectively. This is done using a loop that increments the corresponding index in the count lists.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The function checks if the total number of students with each performance level across both groups is even. If any performance level has an odd total count, it is impossible to balance the groups, and the function prints `-1` and exits. This check is necessary because if the total count is odd, it is impossible to have an equal number of students with that performance level in both groups.

4. **Calculating Exchanges**: For each performance level, the function calculates the absolute difference in counts between the two groups and divides it by 2 to get the number of exchanges needed to balance that performance level. The total number of exchanges is the sum of these values.

5. **Final Output**: The function prints the total number of exchanges needed. However, there is a small issue in the final calculation. The line `print(exchanges_needed // 2)` should be `print(exchanges_needed)` because the `diff` already accounts for the exchanges needed to balance each performance level.

Given this, the program is almost correct, but the final output should be adjusted to avoid dividing by 2 again.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count_a = [0] * 6
    count_b = [0] * 6
    for performance in a:
        count_a[performance] += 1
    for performance in b:
        count_b[performance] += 1
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (count_a[i] + count_b[i]) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            return
    exchanges_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
        exchanges_needed += diff
    print(exchanges_needed)
```

Correctness: **False** (due to the minor issue in the final output calculation). 

However, if the final output is corrected as shown above, the correctness would be **True**.
