You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

The loop executes exactly `n` times, incrementing the corresponding index in `count_a` based on the value of each element in `a`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count_a` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

        count_b[performance] += 1

The loop has completed all 5 iterations. If any of the sums \((count_a[i] + count_b[i]) \% 2\) for \(i\) in [1, 5] is odd, the program has printed -1 and exited. If none of these sums are odd, the program continues without any changes to the variables.

    print(exchanges_needed // 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of integers from the user. Each list `a` and `b` contains `n` integers, and each integer is between 1 and 5 inclusive. The function then counts the occurrences of each integer (from 1 to 5) in both lists `a` and `b`. It checks if the total count of each integer across both lists is even. If any of these totals is odd, the function prints `-1` and exits. If all totals are even, the function calculates the minimum number of swaps required to make the counts of each integer in `a` and `b` equal and prints this number. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which would result in empty lists, but this case is not handled in the code).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in calculating the minimum number of exchanges needed. Specifically, the calculation of `exchanges_needed` is incorrect. The program adds up the differences and then divides by 2, but this approach does not correctly account for the fact that each exchange involves two students, one from each group.

### Incorrect Calculation:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
    exchanges_needed += diff
print(exchanges_needed // 2)
```

### Correct Calculation:
The correct way to calculate the number of exchanges needed is to sum up the absolute differences and then divide by 2, because each exchange involves two students. However, the program already divides the difference by 2 inside the loop, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i])
    exchanges_needed += diff
print(exchanges_needed // 2)
```

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following input:
```
4
5 4 4 4
5 5 4 5
```
The correct output should be `1`, but the current program will output `0` due to the incorrect calculation of `exchanges_needed`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimum number of exchanges, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
