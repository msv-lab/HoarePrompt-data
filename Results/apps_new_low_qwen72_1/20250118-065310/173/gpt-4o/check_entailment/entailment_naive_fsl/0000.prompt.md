You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count_a = [0] * 6
    count_b = [0] * 6
    for performance in a:
        count_a[performance] += 1
    for performance in b:
        count_b[performance] += 1
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (count_a[i] + count_b[i]) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            exit()
    exchanges_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
        exchanges_needed += diff
    print(exchanges_needed // 2)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
