Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values, ensuring `n` is an integer within the specified range, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` with values between 1 and 5.

2. **Counting Performances**: The program uses two lists, `count_a` and `count_b`, to count the occurrences of each performance value (1 through 5) in the lists `a` and `b`. This is done using nested loops, which correctly update the counts.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if the total count of each performance value across both groups is even. If any total count is odd, it is impossible to balance the groups, and the program prints `-1` and exits. This check ensures that the desired distribution is possible.

4. **Calculating Exchanges**: If the distribution is possible, the program calculates the number of exchanges needed. For each performance value, it computes the absolute difference between the counts in `a` and `b`, divides by 2 (since each exchange affects two students), and sums these values to get the total number of exchanges needed.

5. **Final Output**: The program prints the total number of exchanges needed, which is the sum of the differences divided by 2.

The program logic is sound and follows the problem requirements accurately. It handles all edge cases and ensures the correct output based on the input.

Correctness: **True**
