Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`. The input is validated by the problem constraints, ensuring that `n` is within the range [1, 100] and the elements of `a` and `b` are within the range [1, 5].

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program initializes two lists, `count_a` and `count_b`, to count the occurrences of each academic performance (1 through 5) in the lists `a` and `b`. This is done using two separate loops, which correctly update the counts.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if the total number of students with each academic performance (across both groups) is even. If any total is odd, it prints `-1` and exits, indicating that it's impossible to achieve the desired distribution. This check is necessary and correctly implemented.

4. **Calculating Exchanges**: If the distribution is feasible, the program calculates the minimum number of exchanges needed. For each academic performance, it computes the difference in counts between the two groups, divides by 2 (since each exchange involves two students), and sums these values to get the total number of exchanges needed. Finally, it prints the total number of exchanges.

5. **Output**: The program prints the required number of exchanges or `-1` if the desired distribution is not possible, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
