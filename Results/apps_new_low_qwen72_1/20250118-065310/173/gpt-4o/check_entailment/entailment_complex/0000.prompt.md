Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In Berland each high school student is characterized by academic performance — integer value between 1 and 5.

In high school 0xFF there are two groups of pupils: the group A and the group B. Each group consists of exactly n students. An academic performance of each student is known — integer value between 1 and 5.

The school director wants to redistribute students between groups so that each of the two groups has the same number of students whose academic performance is equal to 1, the same number of students whose academic performance is 2 and so on. In other words, the purpose of the school director is to change the composition of groups, so that for each value of academic performance the numbers of students in both groups are equal.

To achieve this, there is a plan to produce a series of exchanges of students between groups. During the single exchange the director selects one student from the class A and one student of class B. After that, they both change their groups.

Print the least number of exchanges, in order to achieve the desired equal numbers of students for each academic performance.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of students in both groups.

The second line contains sequence of integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 5), where a_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group A.

The third line contains sequence of integer numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 5), where b_{i} is academic performance of the i-th student of the group B.


-----Output-----

Print the required minimum number of exchanges or -1, if the desired distribution of students can not be obtained.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a and b are lists of integers of length n, and each element in a and b is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

count_a = [0] * 6

count_b = [0] * 6
    for performance in a:
        count_a[performance] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The loop executes exactly `n` times, incrementing the corresponding index in `count_a` based on the value of each element in `a`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count_a` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    for performance in b:
        count_b[performance] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `b`.
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if (count_a[i] + count_b[i]) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 6, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `b`. The loop has completed all 5 iterations. If any of the sums \((count_a[i] + count_b[i]) \% 2\) for \(i\) in [1, 5] is odd, the program has printed -1 and exited. If none of these sums are odd, the program continues without any changes to the variables.
    exchanges_needed = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        diff = abs(count_a[i] - count_b[i]) // 2
        
        exchanges_needed += diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i is 6, n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), a is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, b is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, count_a is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in a, count_b is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in b, exchanges_needed is the sum of (abs(count_a[j] - count_b[j]) // 2) for j in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], provided that (count_a[i] + count_b[i]) % 2 == 0 for all i in [1, 5]; otherwise, the program prints -1 and exits.
    print(exchanges_needed // 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of integers from the user. Each list `a` and `b` contains `n` integers, and each integer is between 1 and 5 inclusive. The function then counts the occurrences of each integer (from 1 to 5) in both lists `a` and `b`. It checks if the total count of each integer across both lists is even. If any of these totals is odd, the function prints `-1` and exits. If all totals are even, the function calculates the minimum number of swaps required to make the counts of each integer in `a` and `b` equal and prints this number. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which would result in empty lists, but this case is not handled in the code).
