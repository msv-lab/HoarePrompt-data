Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The loop executes exactly `n` times, incrementing the corresponding index in `count_a` based on the value of each element in `a`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count_a` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.**
