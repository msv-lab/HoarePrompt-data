Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of integers from the user. Each list `a` and `b` contains `n` integers, and each integer is between 1 and 5 inclusive. The function then counts the occurrences of each integer (from 1 to 5) in both lists `a` and `b`. It checks if the total count of each integer across both lists is even. If any of these totals is odd, the function prints `-1` and exits. If all totals are even, the function calculates the minimum number of swaps required to make the counts of each integer in `a` and `b` equal and prints this number. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which would result in empty lists, but this case is not handled in the code). **
