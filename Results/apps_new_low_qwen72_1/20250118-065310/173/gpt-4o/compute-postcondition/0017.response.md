The provided code snippet consists of two lines:
1. `print(-1)` - This line prints `-1` to the console.
2. `exit()` - This line terminates the program immediately.

Since the program is terminated after the first print statement, no further lines of code in the program (if there were any) would be executed. Therefore, the state of the variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `count_a`, `count_b`) remains unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **i is 1, n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), a is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, b is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, count_a is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in a, count_b is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in b, the sum of count_a[1] and count_b[1] is odd.**
