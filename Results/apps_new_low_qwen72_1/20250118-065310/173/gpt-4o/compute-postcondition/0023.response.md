The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print(-1)`: This line prints `-1` to the console.
2. `exit()`: This line terminates the program immediately after the print statement.

Since the program exits after the first line, no further lines of code (including those not shown) are executed. The variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `count_a`, and `count_b` remain unchanged from their initial state. However, the program's execution is terminated, so no further operations can modify these variables.

Output State: **i is 3, n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), a is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, b is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, count_a is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in a, count_b is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in b, -1 is printed to the console, and the program is terminated**.
