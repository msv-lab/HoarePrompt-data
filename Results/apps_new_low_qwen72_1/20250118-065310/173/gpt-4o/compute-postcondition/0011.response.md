The code snippet `count_b[performance] += 1` increments the value at the index `performance` in the list `count_b` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive.
- `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive.
- `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
- `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[performance]` is 1, where `performance` is the second element in `b` (an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive).

The value of `count_b[performance]` was initially 1. After executing the code snippet, `count_b[performance]` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[performance]` is 2, `performance` is the second element in `b` (which is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive)**
