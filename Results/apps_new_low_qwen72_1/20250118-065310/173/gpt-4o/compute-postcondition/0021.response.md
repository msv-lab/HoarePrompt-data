Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `b`. If the sum of `count_a[2]` and `count_b[2]` is odd, the program has printed -1 and exited. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
