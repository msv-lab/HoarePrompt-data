The provided code snippet consists of two lines:
1. `print(-1)` - This line prints `-1` to the console.
2. `exit()` - This line terminates the program immediately.

Since the program is terminated by the `exit()` function, no further lines of code (if there were any) would be executed, and no changes are made to any of the variables in the initial state.

Therefore, the final state remains unchanged except for the fact that the program has printed `-1` and then exited.

Output State: **i is 2, n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), a is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, b is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, count_a is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in a, count_b is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in b, the sum of count_a[1] and count_b[1] is either odd or even (condition remains as it was in the initial state), the program has printed -1 and exited**.
