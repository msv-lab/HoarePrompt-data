The code snippet `count_b[performance] += 1` increments the value at the index `performance` in the list `count_b` by 1. Given that `count_b[performance]` was initially 2, after executing this line, `count_b[performance]` will be 3.

The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `n`, `a`, `b`, and `count_a` are still valid. The only change is in the value of `count_b[performance]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except `count_b[performance]` is 3, `performance` is the third element in `b` (an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive)**.
