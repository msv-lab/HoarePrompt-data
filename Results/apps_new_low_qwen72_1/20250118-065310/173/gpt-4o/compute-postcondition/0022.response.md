The only variables in the loop head are `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to 5 (inclusive), so `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `count_a`, `count_b`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `b`.**
