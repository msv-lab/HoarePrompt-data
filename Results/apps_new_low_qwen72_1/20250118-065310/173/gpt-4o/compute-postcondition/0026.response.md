The variable `exchanges_needed` is initialized to 0. This does not affect the other variables, and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `count_b` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `b`, the loop has completed all 5 iterations, if any of the sums \((count_a[i] + count_b[i]) \% 2\) for \(i\) in [1, 5] is odd, the program has printed -1 and exited, if none of these sums are odd, the program continues without any changes to the variables, `exchanges_needed` is 0**
