The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range defined as `range(1, 6)`, so we can only adjust `i`. The loop iterates over the values from 1 to 5 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and it must still be within the range defined by the loop.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in a, `count_b` is a list of integers of length 6 where each element at index i represents the count of occurrences of i in b, `exchanges_needed` is the integer division of the absolute difference between count_a[1] and count_b[1] by 2**
