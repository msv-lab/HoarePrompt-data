The value of `count_a[performance]` is incremented by 1. Since `performance` is the second element of `a`, and initially `count_a[performance]` was 1 (as indicated by the precondition that `count_a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except at the index `performance` which is incremented by 1), after the increment, `count_a[performance]` becomes 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 5 inclusive, `count_a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` except at the index `performance` which is 2, `count_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `performance` is the second element of `a`**
