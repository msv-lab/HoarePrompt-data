The provided program is designed to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as specified in the problem description.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

### Code Logic:
1. If `n` is already a multiple of 10 (i.e., `n % 10 == 0`), it prints `n`.
2. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5 (i.e., `n % 10 <= 5`), it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the last digit from `n`.
3. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding the difference needed to reach the next multiple of 10.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 0`, the output should be `0`, which the code handles correctly.
- For `n = 5`, the output can be either `0` or `10`, and the code rounds down to `0`, which is acceptable.
- For `n = 10`, the output should be `10`, which is correct.
- For `n = 15`, the output would be `20`, which is also correct.
- For `n = 25`, the output would be `30`, correct again.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function prints `n` if it is a multiple of 10, rounds down if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, and rounds up if the last digit is greater than 5. This description matches the program logic.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints align with the code's behavior. Since there are no edge cases where the code fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program handles all specified cases correctly, rounding `n` to the nearest integer that ends in 0 as required.
