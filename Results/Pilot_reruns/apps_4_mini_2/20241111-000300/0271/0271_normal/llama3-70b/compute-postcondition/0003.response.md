The code prints the result of the expression `n + (10 - n % 10)`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. The expression calculates the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`.

The state of the variables is affected as follows:
- `n` retains its value as an input integer.
- The expression computes `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which will yield a number that represents the next multiple of 10.

Since `n` can take any value within the specified range, the output will depend on the specific input value. However, the output state fundamentally remains unchanged apart from the printed result.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and the result printed is `n + (10 - n % 10)`**
