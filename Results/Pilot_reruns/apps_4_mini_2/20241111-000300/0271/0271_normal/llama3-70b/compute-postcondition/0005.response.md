Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function prints `n`. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, the function prints `n` rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, the function prints `n` rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.***
