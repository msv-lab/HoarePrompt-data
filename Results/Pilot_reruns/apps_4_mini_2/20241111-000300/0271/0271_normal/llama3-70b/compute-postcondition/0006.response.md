The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the output description, it returns a value based on the non-negative integer `n` such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since the function definition does not include `n` as a parameter, it is unclear how the function operates or what it returns without further context. 

Given this, we can summarize the functionality based on the provided constraints:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a non-negative integer n, which must satisfy the condition 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, but the specifics of the return value are not provided.**
