The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). It prints `n` if it is a multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it prints `n` rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.
