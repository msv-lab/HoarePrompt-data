The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9). It calculates the closest multiple of 10 to `n`: if the last digit (remainder) of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from `n`; if the last digit is greater than 5, it adds the difference to reach the next multiple of 10. The resulting value is then printed.
