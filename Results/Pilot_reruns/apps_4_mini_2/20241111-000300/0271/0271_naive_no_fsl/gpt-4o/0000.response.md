To determine the correctness of the provided program, we'll analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem states that Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer \( n \) to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The rounding logic can be described as follows:
- If \( n \) ends with 0, it is already rounded.
- If \( n \) ends with a digit from 1 to 5, we round down to the nearest integer that ends with 0.
- If \( n \) ends with a digit from 6 to 9, we round up to the nearest integer that ends with 0.

Let's break down the code:

```python
n = int(input())
remainder = n % 10
if remainder <= 5:
    result = n - remainder
else:
    result = n + (10 - remainder)
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input**: The program reads a single integer \( n \).
2. **Finding the remainder**: `remainder = n % 10` effectively finds the last digit of \( n \).
3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from \( n \) (which rounds down).
   - If the remainder is greater than 5, it adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to \( n \) (which rounds up).
4. **Output**: The program prints the rounded result.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: \( n = 5 \)
  - Remainder: 5
  - Logic: rounds down to 0 (correct).
- **Case 2**: \( n = 6 \)
  - Remainder: 6
  - Logic: rounds up to 10 (correct).
- **Case 3**: \( n = 10 \)
  - Remainder: 0
  - Logic: stays at 10 (correct).
- **Case 4**: \( n = 15 \)
  - Remainder: 5
  - Logic: rounds down to 10 (correct).
- **Case 5**: \( n = 22 \)
  - Remainder: 2
  - Logic: rounds down to 20 (correct).
- **Case 6**: \( n = 999999999 \)
  - Remainder: 9
  - Logic: rounds up to 1000000000 (correct).
- **Case 7**: \( n = 0 \)
  - Remainder: 0
  - Logic: stays at 0 (correct).

After running through various cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
