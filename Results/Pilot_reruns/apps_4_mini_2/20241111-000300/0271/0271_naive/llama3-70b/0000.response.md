Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles the rounding of a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with a 0, as specified in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **If `n` is already a multiple of 10** (i.e., `n % 10 == 0`), it prints `n`, which is correct as it is already rounded.

2. **If `n` is not a multiple of 10**, the program checks whether the last digit (`n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5:
   - If it is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the last digit from `n` (i.e., `n - n % 10`). This is correct as it gives the nearest integer ending with 0 that is less than or equal to `n`.
   
3. **If the last digit is greater than 5**, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10 by adding the difference needed to reach the next multiple of 10 (i.e., `n + (10 - n % 10)`). This is also correct as it gives the nearest integer ending with 0 that is greater than `n`.

The program handles all cases specified in the problem description correctly and adheres to the provided constraints. Therefore, it is correct.
