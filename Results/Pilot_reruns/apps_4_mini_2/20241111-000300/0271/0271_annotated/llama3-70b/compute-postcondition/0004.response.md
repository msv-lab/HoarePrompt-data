Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer. If `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the output is the nearest lower multiple of 10, which is `n - n % 10`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the output is the next higher multiple of 10, calculated as `n + (10 - n % 10)`. Thus, the program effectively rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10, where numbers ending in 0-5 are rounded down and those ending in 6-9 are rounded up.***
