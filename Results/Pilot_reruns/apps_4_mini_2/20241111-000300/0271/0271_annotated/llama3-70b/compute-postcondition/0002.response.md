The code executes a print statement that calculates `n - n % 10`. The variable `n` holds an input integer, so the value of `n % 10` will be the remainder of `n` divided by 10. The result of this calculation will be `n` rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10. The print statement does not change the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `n` and the calculated result of the expression.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and the expression `n - n % 10` results in the nearest lower multiple of 10**.
