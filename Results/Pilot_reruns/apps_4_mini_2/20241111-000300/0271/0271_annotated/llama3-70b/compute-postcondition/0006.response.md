The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Since the output details are not provided, we will describe the functionality based solely on the input parameter. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a non-negative integer `n` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
