Output State: **`window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors` starting from index `i` up to but not including index `n`. `found` is True if the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, leaving `window_counts` empty and `found` unchanged. If `colors` does not contain any colors from `counts`, `found` will remain unchanged even if the loop executes.**
