Output State: **`window_counts` contains counts of colors from the `colors` list indexed from `i` to `j-1`, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `i` is unchanged, `j` will be equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`. If `n` is equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` and `j` remain unchanged.**
