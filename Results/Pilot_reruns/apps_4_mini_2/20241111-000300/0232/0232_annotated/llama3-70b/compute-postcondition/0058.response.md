Postcondition: ***`window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` is set to True, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` is greater than `i` if all counts in `window_counts` (sorted) match the corresponding values in `counts`. If the condition is not met, the values of `window_counts`, `found`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.***
