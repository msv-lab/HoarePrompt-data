Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In case the values do not match, `found` remains unchanged. Additionally, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.***
