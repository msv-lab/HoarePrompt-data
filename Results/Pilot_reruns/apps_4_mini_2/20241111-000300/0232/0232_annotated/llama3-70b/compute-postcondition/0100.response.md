Postcondition: ***`window_counts` has been updated for `color`, `found` is False, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`. If `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is now set to 0. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
