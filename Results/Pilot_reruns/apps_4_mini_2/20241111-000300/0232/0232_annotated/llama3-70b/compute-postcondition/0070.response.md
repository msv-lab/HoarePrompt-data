Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is initialized to 0, ensuring that `window_counts[color]` has a defined value following the execution of the program fragment. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, there is no change to `window_counts`.***
