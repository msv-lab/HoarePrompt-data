The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `found` is set to True, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
