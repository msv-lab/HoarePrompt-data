The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
