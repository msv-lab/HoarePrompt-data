Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, the loop is exited; otherwise, the loop continues without any modification to `found`.***
