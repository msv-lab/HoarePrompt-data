Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `color` is the second element in the colors list, and `counts` is a list of integers derived from input. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
