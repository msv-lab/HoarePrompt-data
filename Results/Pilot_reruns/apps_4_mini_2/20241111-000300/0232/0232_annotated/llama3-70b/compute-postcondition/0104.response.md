Postcondition: ***`window_counts` has been updated for `color`, `found` is a boolean indicating whether the condition was met, which is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating a successful match; otherwise, `found` remains False. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged and `j` is equal to `i + 1`, with `color` assigned the value from `colors[j]` and `window_counts[color]` incremented by 1. If the condition is met, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
