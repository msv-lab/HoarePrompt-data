The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a count of 1; `found` is True; `i` is unchanged; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
