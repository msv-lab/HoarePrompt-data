Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color such that 1 ≤ ∑ `k[i]` ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, and `current_counts` has been updated with the increment of current_counts[colors[right]] by 1. If the current counts for all colors in `desired_counts` match their corresponding desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. If any of the counts do not match, the function does not return 'YES'.***
