Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color such that 1 ≤ ∑ `k[i]` ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, and there exists at least one color where `current_counts[color] < desired_counts[color]`. If the current counts of all colors in `current_counts` match their corresponding desired counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
