Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
