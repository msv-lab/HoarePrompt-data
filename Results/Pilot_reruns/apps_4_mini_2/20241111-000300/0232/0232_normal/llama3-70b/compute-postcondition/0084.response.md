Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that includes the entry `{color: 0}` if `color` was not already present in it. `color_counts` remains unchanged, and the values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain as 1, greater than 1, and 1 respectively, while `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` remains unchanged.***
