Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that a valid window has been found. If there are any mismatches in counts, `found` remains unchanged.***
