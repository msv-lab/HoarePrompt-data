Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, then `found` is set to True, `i` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, the state of `found`, `i`, `j`, and the contents of `window_counts` remain unchanged, while `n` is greater than 1 and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`.***
