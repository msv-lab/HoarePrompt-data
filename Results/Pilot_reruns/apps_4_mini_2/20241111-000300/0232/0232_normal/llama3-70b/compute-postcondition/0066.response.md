Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` after sorting, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, the program continues without any changes to `found` or the loop state.***
