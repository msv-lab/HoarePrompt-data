Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop or conditional statement breaks, leaving `window_counts`, `color_counts`, and `i` unchanged, while `found` remains True. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining empty, `found` being False, `i` still being 1, and `color_counts` unchanged.***
