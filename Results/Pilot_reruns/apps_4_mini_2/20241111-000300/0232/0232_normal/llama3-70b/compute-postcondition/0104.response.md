Postcondition: ***`window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, and `j` is 3. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match `counts`, then the variable `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the program continues executing without any changes to `found`, `window_counts`, or `color_counts`.***
