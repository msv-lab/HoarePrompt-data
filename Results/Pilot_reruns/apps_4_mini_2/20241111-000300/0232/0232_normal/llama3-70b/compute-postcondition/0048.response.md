Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`. If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `i` as 0 and `window_counts` as an empty dictionary unchanged. If `found` is False (which occurs if the loop does not execute or if there are mismatches in counts), `found` remains False, `i` remains 0, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.***
