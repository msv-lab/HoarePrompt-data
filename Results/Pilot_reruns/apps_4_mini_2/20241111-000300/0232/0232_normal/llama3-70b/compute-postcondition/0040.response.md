Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`. `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`. `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present, `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
