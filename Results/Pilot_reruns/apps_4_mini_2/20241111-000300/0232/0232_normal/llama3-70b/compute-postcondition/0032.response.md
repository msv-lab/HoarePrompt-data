Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`, `found` is set to False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `color` is present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
