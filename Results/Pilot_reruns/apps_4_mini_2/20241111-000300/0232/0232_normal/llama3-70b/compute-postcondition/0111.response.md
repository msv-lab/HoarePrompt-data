Output State: **If n is at least 1, window_counts will be a dictionary tracking counts of colors for each i, and found indicates if a match was found; the output will be 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of found. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, color_counts remains unchanged, and found is False, resulting in output 'NO'.**
