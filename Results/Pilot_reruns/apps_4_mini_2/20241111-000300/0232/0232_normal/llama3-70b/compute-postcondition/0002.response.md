The code takes input in the form of a space-separated string of integers, converts them to integers, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `counts`. The previous values of `colors`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, but `counts` is updated with the new list of integers. The output state reflects that `counts` now holds the new list of integers while `colors`, `n`, and `m` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`colors` is a list of n integers, `counts` is updated to a list of integers from input, `n` and `m` are unchanged.**
