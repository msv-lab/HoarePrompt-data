The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. This assignment does not affect the other variables (`color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`), which retain their previous values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the `colors` list and values are the counts of each integer, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the `colors` list and values are the counts of each integer, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
