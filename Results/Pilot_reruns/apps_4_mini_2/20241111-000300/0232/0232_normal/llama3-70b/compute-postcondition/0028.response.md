Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`. If all counts in `window_counts`, when sorted, match the corresponding counts in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, indicating that the target counts have been found, while `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` has `color` incremented by 1, and `j` is 0. If the counts do not match, the state of `found`, `i`, `n`, `window_counts`, and `j` remains unchanged.***
