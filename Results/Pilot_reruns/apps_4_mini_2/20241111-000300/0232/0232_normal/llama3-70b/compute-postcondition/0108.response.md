Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop is exited, and `window_counts` and `color_counts` remain unchanged, with `i` equal to 1, `n` greater than 1, and `j` between `i` and `n-1`. If `n` is equal to `i`, or less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty. Additionally, if `window_counts` matches `counts` during any iteration, `found` is set to True, leading to the break in the loop.***
