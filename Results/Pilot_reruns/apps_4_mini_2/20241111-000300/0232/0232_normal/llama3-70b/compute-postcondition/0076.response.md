Output State: **If n is greater than 1 and the loop executes, `window_counts` will contain the counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]`, with `j` being the current index in the range from `i` to `n-1`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if n is less than or equal to 1), `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, `i` is still 1, and `color_counts` remains unchanged.**
