The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `window_counts` includes the key `color` with a value of 1 if `color` was not previously present, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
