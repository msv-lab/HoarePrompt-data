Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary representing the count of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` to `n-1`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is between `i` and `n-1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `n` is equal to `i`, the loop does not execute and `window_counts` remains empty. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty. If `window_counts` matches the `counts` after any iteration, `found` is set to True and the loop exits; otherwise, `found` remains unchanged.**
