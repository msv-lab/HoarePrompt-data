Initial State: `color_counts` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the `colors` list and values are the counts of each integer; `found` is assigned the value False.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: If `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary initially. If `found` is True, it indicates that a matching condition was met, causing an exit from the inner loop. If `found` remains False, `window_counts` will still be empty, `i` will be 0, and `color_counts` remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the loops, leaving `color_counts` unchanged, `i` as 0, and `window_counts` unchanged. If `found` is False, meaning no match was found in the first iteration, `window_counts` is empty, `i` is 1, and `color_counts` remains unchanged. If `n` is 1 or less, the outer loop does not execute.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: If `found` is True, it indicates a match was found, resulting in an exit from both loops, leaving `color_counts` unchanged and `i` equal to 1. If `found` is still False, `window_counts` remains empty, `i` is 2, and `color_counts` remains unchanged. If `n` is 2 or less, or if the inner loop completes without finding a match, `window_counts` remains empty.

If `n` is equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `color_counts` remains unchanged, while `found` stays False. Additionally, if `n` is less than or equal to 1, the outer loop will not run, leaving `found` and `window_counts` unchanged.

Output State: **If n is at least 1, window_counts will be a dictionary tracking counts of colors for each i, and found indicates if a match was found. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, color_counts remains unchanged, and found is False.**
