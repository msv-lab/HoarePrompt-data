Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of `k`'s elements is at least 1 and at most `n`; `desired_counts` is a dictionary created from zipping range(1, m + 1) with `k`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int) with increased count for `colors[right]`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0. If the counts of each color in `current_counts` match exactly with the counts specified in `desired_counts`, then the function returns 'YES', indicating that the desired color distribution has been achieved. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
