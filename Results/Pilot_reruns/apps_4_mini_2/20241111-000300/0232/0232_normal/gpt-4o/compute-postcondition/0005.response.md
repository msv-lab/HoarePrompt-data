The function returns the string 'YES'. The return statement does not change the state of other variables, so the output state remains as is.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers where the sum of k's elements (k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m) is at least 1 and at most n; `desired_counts` is a dictionary created from zipping range(1, m + 1) with k; `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int) with increased count for colors[right], `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the function returns 'YES'**
