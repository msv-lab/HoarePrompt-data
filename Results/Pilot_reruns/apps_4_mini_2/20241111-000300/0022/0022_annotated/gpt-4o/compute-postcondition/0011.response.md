Output State: **If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop checks pairs of characters from the beginning and end of the string `s`. After executing the loop `n // 2` times, if no mismatches are found, the function would imply that `s` is a palindrome. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the state remains as `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is 1, and no checks have been performed.**
