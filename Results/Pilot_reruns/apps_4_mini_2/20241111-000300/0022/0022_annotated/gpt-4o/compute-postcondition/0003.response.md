Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not equal the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. There are no additional conditions to consider for the else part, as it is not defined in the code.***
