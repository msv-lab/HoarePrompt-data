Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at position `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return False, meaning the characters match at the specified positions.***
