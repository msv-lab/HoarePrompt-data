The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(s)`, which computes the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), the value of `n` will be between 1 and 1000. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s**
