According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 2, since the loop iterates from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not run. 

Given that `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` must be defined as the length of the new input string, which should be at least 2 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will begin from 0. 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, the following states should be adjusted:
- `n` should be at least 2,
- `i` should start at 0.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
