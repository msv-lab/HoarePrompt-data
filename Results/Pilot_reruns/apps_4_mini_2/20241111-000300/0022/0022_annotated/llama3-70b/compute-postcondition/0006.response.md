Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is exited, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome. If the characters are equal, the loop continues, and the check for palindrome may proceed for further indices.***
