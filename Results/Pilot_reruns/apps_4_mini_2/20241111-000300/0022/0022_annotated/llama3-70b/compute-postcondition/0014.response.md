Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, and `i` is at least 1. If the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in the string `s` are not equal, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, the program continues to check the next characters without changing `is_spalindrome`.***
