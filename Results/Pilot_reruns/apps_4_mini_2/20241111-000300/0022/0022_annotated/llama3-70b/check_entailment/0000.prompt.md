You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

 [Image] English alphabet 

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    #State of the program here: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting only of English letters, and `s` is now assigned a new input string.
    n = len(s)
    #State of the program here: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of the new input string
    is_spalindrome = True
    #State of the program here: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of the new input string; `is_spalindrome` is True
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - i - 1]:
            is_spalindrome = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is at least 2, the loop checks pairs of characters from the start and end of the string `s`. If `s` is a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` remains True; if a mismatch is found, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop exits. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `n` is 0 or negative (which should not occur given the initial state), the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True.
    print('TAK' if is_spalindrome else 'NIE')
    #State of the program here: `is_spalindrome` is True and the function prints 'TAK'
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string input `s` with a length between 1 and 1000, consisting only of English letters. It checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string moving towards the center. If `s` is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not return any value, as it only prints the result.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
