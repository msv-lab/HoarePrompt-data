The function accepts a string input `s` with a length between 1 and 1000, consisting only of English letters. It checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string moving towards the center. If `s` is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not return any value, as it only prints the result.
