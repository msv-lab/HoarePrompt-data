According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the computed value of `n // 2`. Currently, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 4, which means `n // 2` is at least 2. 

Given `i` is 2, it's less than `n // 2` when `n` is 4, which allows the loop to execute. However, for the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1, which means `i` will become 3 in the next iteration. To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`. 

Since `n` is at least 4, `n // 2` is at least 2, thus `i` should be adjusted to be less than 2 for the loop to run again. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` while keeping `s` and `n` unchanged:

State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3**
