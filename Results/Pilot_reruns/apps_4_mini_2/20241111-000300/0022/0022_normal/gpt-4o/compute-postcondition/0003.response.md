Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at the 0th index of `s` is not equal to the character at the (n-1)th index of `s`, the function returns False. If they are equal, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).***
