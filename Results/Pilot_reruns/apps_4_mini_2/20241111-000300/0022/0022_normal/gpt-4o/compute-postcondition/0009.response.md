Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If the characters do match, the function does not return False, but further execution depends on the complete program context not provided here.***
