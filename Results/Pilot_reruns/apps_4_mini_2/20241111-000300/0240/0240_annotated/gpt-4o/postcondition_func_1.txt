The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`, returning a boolean indicating if `sub` is present in `num_str`. However, the function does not check if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`, as the variable `n_len` is not defined within the function. Therefore, it only verifies the presence of `sub` in `num_str`.
