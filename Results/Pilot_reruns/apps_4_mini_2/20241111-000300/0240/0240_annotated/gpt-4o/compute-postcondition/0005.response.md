The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means that `candidate` will be a string created by concatenating all the elements of `perm`. Since `perm` is defined as the second permutation of `chars`, the value of `candidate` will be the second permutation of the string `chars`. The state of the variable `chars` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the second permutation of `chars`**
