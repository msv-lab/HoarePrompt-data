Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, and `candidate` is the third permutation of `chars` as a string. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` does not meet the validity criteria, there is no yield operation performed.***
