According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` string and the `permutations` function. The loop iterates over each permutation of `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`. 

To determine the next state:
1. The next permutation after the second one should be the third permutation.
2. The `chars` string remains the same since the loop iterates over the permutations of the same string.
3. The `perm` state needs to be adjusted to reflect that it will now be the third permutation of `chars`.

Since no other variables (`candidate`, `sub`, etc.) need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again, we only need to adjust the `perm` state.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`**
