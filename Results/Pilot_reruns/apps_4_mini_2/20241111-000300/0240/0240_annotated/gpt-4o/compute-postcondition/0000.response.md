According to the code, the loop executes permutations of the `chars` string. For the loop to run, `chars` must not be empty, as permutations of an empty string do not yield any results. Given that `chars` is specified as a string of digits with a length of at most 1,000,000, it can potentially be empty, but it must contain at least one digit for permutations to be generated.

Additionally, the variable `perm` will be defined as each permutation generated during the loop execution. The first permutation would be the sorted version of `chars` if it contains at least one character.

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
1. `chars` must have a length of at least 1 (i.e., it should not be empty).
2. `perm` starts as the first permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
