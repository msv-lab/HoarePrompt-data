Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string of digits `s` and a non-empty substring of digits `sub`, calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters present in `sub`, and returns the smallest number that can be formed from those remaining characters. If `sub` contains characters not present in `s`, those will not affect the outcome, and the function will still return the smallest number based on the remaining characters. The function does not handle cases where all characters in `s` are removed by the characters in `sub`, which could lead to an empty list of possible numbers when generating combinations. In such cases, the function may raise a ValueError when trying to find the minimum of an empty sequence. **
