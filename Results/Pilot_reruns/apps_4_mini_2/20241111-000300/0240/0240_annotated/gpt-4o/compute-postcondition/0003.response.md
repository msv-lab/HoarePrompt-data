Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when evaluated with `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, there is no action taken in this block.***
