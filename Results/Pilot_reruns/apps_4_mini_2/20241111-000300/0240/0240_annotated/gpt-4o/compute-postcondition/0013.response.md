Output State: **If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the loop will generate all permutations of `chars`, yielding valid candidates that satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains only one digit, the loop executes once, yielding that single digit if it is valid according to the `is_valid_number` function; otherwise, no candidates are yielded.**
