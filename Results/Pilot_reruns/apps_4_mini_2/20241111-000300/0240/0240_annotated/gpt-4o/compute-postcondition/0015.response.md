Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `chars` consisting of digits and a non-empty string `sub`. It generates all permutations of `chars` and yields those that are valid numbers according to the `is_valid_number` function when compared to `sub`. If `chars` is empty, no candidates are yielded. The function does not return a list but instead uses a generator to yield valid combinations one by one. It does not specifically ensure that the yielded candidates are unique, nor does it handle cases where `sub` might not be a valid number itself. **
