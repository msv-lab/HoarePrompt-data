The function accepts a string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `t`, then constructs a new string `n` by including all characters from `s` that are also in `t`, followed by appending `t` itself. Finally, it converts this string `n` to an integer and returns it. If `s` has no characters present in `t`, then the resulting integer will be the integer representation of `t`. Note that if `s` is an empty string, the function will return the integer value of `t`.
