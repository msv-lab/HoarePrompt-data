Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of digits with a length greater than 1, and `c` is the second character of `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, the operation `n += c` fails due to a TypeError, indicating that `n` cannot be concatenated with a string. There is no else part in the code to handle this condition.***
