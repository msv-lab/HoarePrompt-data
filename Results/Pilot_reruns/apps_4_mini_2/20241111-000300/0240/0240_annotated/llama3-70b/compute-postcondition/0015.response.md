The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. The parameter `s` is a string of digits with a length of up to 1,000,000, and `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, the function creates a string `n` composed of all characters from `s` that are also present in a set derived from `t`, and then appends the value of `t` to this string. Finally, the function returns the integer value of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a non-empty substring `t`, and return the integer value formed by combining the characters from `s` that are also in `t` with the substring `t` itself. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty substring `t`, and returns the integer value obtained by combining characters from `s` that are also in `t` with the substring `t`.**
