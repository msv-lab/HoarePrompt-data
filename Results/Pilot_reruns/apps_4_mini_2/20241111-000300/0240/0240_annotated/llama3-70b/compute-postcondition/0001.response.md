The variable `n` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, as `n` is the only variable being modified. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length up to 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`; `t_set` contains the unique digits from `t`; `n` is an empty string**
