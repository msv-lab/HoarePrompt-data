To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic behind it.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer \( n \) such that:
1. \( n \) should be a concatenation of digits from the string \( s \) and the substring \( t \).
2. After appending \( k \) (the number of digits in \( n \)), the digits should be shuffled to form \( s \).

### Code Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes two inputs: `s` (the shuffled string) and `t` (the remembered substring).
2. It initializes an empty string `n`.
3. It creates a set `t_set` from `t` to facilitate quick membership testing.
4. The code iterates through each character in `s`, and if that character is found in `t_set`, it adds it to `n`.
5. Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and returns the integer representation of `n`.

### Issues with the Code:
The code does not ensure that \( n \) is the smallest possible integer. Specifically:
- The way digits are collected from \( s \) does not account for the ordering. For example, if \( s \) is "003512" and \( t \) is "021", the program will construct "30021" which is correct. However, it may not guarantee the smallest \( n \) in all cases since it does not consider all possible combinations of digits from \( s \) and \( t \).
- The function does not control for leading zeros when forming \( n \). If the digits of \( n \) were to include '0' at the start (except for the case where \( n \) is '0'), it would violate the condition of having no leading zeros.

### Test Cases to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
s = "000123"
t = "12"
```
- The expected smallest \( n \) should be "1200".
- However, the program would construct "0012" (which turns into 12) as it collects digits from \( s \) that are in \( t \), leading to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not guarantee the formation of the smallest integer \( n \) and can lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
