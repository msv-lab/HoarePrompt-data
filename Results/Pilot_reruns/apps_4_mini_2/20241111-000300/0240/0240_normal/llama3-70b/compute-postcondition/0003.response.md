The value of `n` is updated by appending `c` to it. Since `n` is initially an empty string and `c` is the first character of `s` (which is a digit), after execution, `n` will contain that first character. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` contains unique digits from `t`, `n` is the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` contains unique digits from `t`, `n` is the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character of `s`**
