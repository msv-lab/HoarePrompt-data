Output State: **`n` is a string consisting of the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If `t_set` is empty or does not contain any characters from `s`, then `n` will also remain an empty string as the loop will not add any characters to `n`.**
