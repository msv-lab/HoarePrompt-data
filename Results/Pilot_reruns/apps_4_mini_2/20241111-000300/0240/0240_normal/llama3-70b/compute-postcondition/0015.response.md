The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. The parameter `s` is a string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `t` is a non-empty string of digits which may contain leading zeroes. The function processes these parameters to create a string `n` that consists of the characters from `s` that are also present in `t`. Finally, the function returns the integer representation of the string `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty string `t` of digits, and returns the integer representation of the string formed by characters in `s` that are also in `t`.**
