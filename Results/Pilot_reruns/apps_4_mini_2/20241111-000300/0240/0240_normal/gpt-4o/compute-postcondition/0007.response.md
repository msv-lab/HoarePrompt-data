Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not a valid number, no action is taken.***
