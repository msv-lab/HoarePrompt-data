Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the third permutation of `chars` as a string. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked with `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not a valid number, nothing is yielded.***
