The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in the string `perm`. Since `perm` is defined as the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will hold that same value. The state of `chars` remains unchanged, and `perm` is also unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables after the assignment.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `perm`**
