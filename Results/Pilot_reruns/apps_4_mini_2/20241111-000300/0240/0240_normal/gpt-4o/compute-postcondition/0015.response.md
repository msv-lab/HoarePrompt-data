The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts a string parameter `chars`, which is expected to contain digits, and a non-empty string parameter `sub`, which is also expected to contain digits. The function generates permutations of the `chars` string and yields those permutations as candidates only if they pass a validity check defined by the `is_valid_number` function, using the `sub` string as an additional criterion for this check.

The functionality of the function is to produce valid permutations of the digits in `chars`, filtered by the criteria of `is_valid_number`. If `chars` is empty, no candidates are generated. If `chars` contains only one digit, it will yield that digit if it passes the validity check. The function does not handle cases where `chars` may contain duplicate digits, which could lead to repeated candidates being yielded without filtering them.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty substring of digits `sub`, generating valid permutations of `chars` based on the validity defined by `is_valid_number`. If `chars` is empty, no candidates are yielded, and if it contains duplicates, those duplicates may lead to repeated outputs. **
