According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations generated from the `chars` string. Since the loop iterates through all permutations of `chars`, we need to consider the current state of `perm` at the end of the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, `perm` must be set to the next permutation in the sequence. The function `permutations(chars)` generates all possible permutations, and since `perm` is currently the first permutation, we need to adjust it to the second permutation of `chars`.

Since `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, we can still maintain its state, and we will only adjust `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`.**
