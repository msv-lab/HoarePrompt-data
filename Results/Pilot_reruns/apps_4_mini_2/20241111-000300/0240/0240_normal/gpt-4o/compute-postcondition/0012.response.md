According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the number of permutations is determined by the length of `chars`. As stated, `perm` is currently the third permutation of `chars`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. If `perm` is the third permutation, it means that there are at least three permutations available in total.
2. The loop will continue to execute until all permutations are exhausted. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that we are moving to the next permutation.
3. The next permutation after the third one would be the fourth permutation of `chars`.

The state of `chars` does not need to be changed since it remains the same for all iterations. We only need to adjust `perm` to reflect the next permutation and also note that `candidate` will also need to be updated accordingly to the new permutation.

Thus, the adjusted state would be:
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the fourth permutation of `chars` as a string.**
