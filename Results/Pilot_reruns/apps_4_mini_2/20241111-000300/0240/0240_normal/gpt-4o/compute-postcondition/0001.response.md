The value of `candidate` is assigned the result of `''.join(perm)`, which constructs a string by concatenating the elements of the iterable `perm`. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `perm`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `perm`**
