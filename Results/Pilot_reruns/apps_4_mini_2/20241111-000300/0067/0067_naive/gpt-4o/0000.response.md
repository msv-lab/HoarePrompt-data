Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to account for the case where the unknown voters (z) could potentially balance the votes, leading to an uncertain outcome. Specifically, it does not handle the situation where the number of upvotes and downvotes could be equal after considering the unknown votes. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 1
```
With this input:
- Minimum upvotes = 1
- Maximum upvotes = 1 + 1 = 2
- Minimum downvotes = 1
- Maximum downvotes = 1 + 1 = 2

In this case, the results could be:
- If the unknown voter upvotes, there would be 2 upvotes and 1 downvote (resulting in "+").
- If the unknown voter downvotes, there would be 1 upvote and 2 downvotes (resulting in "-").
- If the unknown voter does not affect the outcome, it could remain 1 upvote and 1 downvote (resulting in "0").

Thus, there are multiple possible outcomes, and the program should print "?". However, the current implementation does not capture this scenario correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
