To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and its annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nauuo is assessing the votes she might receive:
- `x`: definite upvotes,
- `y`: definite downvotes,
- `z`: unknown votes which could be either upvotes or downvotes.

The output should be:
- "+" if upvotes are guaranteed to be greater than downvotes,
- "-" if downvotes are guaranteed to be greater than upvotes,
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes with no ambiguity,
- "?" if the result is uncertain depending on how the `z` unknown votes are cast.

### Code Analysis:
The program reads the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, and calculates:
- `min_upvotes = x`
- `max_upvotes = x + z`
- `min_downvotes = y`
- `max_downvotes = y + z`

Then it checks:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `-`.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `+`.
3. If neither of the above conditions hold, it prints `?`.

### Annotations and Their Influence:
The annotations describe the states and logic of the program. They indicate:
- The program correctly identifies distinct conditions for printing `-` and `+`.
- The output `?` is printed when there is uncertainty regarding the outcome, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Edge Cases:
We should validate the behavior of the program against the provided examples:

1. **Example (3, 7, 0)**: 
   - `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`
   - `3 < 7` (prints `-`), which is correct.

2. **Example (2, 0, 1)**:
   - `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`
   - `1 < 2` (prints `+`), which is correct.

3. **Example (1, 1, 0)**:
   - `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`
   - `1 == 1` (prints `0`), which is correct.

4. **Example (0, 0, 1)**:
   - `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`
   - `1 > 0` and `1 > 0` (prints `?`), which is correct (uncertainty due to `z`).

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the implementation and examples, the program correctly handles all specified cases from the problem description, including edge cases. The logic for determining certain versus uncertain outcomes aligns with the requirements.

Thus, the program behaves as expected for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
