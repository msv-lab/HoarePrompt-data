The code executes a print statement that outputs a plus sign (`'+'`). It does not change the values of any existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the printed output.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and the function prints '+'**
