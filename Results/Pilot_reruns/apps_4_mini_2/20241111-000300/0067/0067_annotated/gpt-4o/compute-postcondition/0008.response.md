Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input. If the maximum downvotes (`y + z`) are less than the minimum upvotes (`x`), the function prints '+'. In all other cases, including when the maximum downvotes are equal to or greater than the minimum upvotes, the function prints '?'.***
