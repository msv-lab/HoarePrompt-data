The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x` (input integer), `y` (user input integer), and `z` (user input integer). The values of `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment and the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`**
