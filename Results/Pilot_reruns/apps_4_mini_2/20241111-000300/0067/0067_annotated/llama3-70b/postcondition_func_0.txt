The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` (where each is between 0 and 100). It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, or if `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, and it prints '?' when `x` is not equal to `y`. The function does not return any value, it only outputs to the console.
