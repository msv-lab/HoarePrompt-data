The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it is expected to work with three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` that are constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Since there is no output information provided in the prompt, we cannot determine what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined in terms of output behavior. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is undefined based on the provided information.**
