The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The values of `x` and `z` are within the range of 0 to 100. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will take a value between `0 + 0 = 0` and `100 + 100 = 200`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100); `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`**
