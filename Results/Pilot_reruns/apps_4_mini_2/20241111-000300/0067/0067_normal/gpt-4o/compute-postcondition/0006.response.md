The code uses the `print` function to output the string `+`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100), and the printed output is '+'**
