Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), the output is '+'; otherwise, the output is '?'. This includes cases where `max_downvotes` equals `min_upvotes`, or `max_downvotes` is greater than `min_upvotes`, ensuring all relationships between upvotes and downvotes are accurately represented.***
