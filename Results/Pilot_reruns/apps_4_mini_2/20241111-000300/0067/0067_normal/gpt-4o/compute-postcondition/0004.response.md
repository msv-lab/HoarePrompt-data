The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value `y + z`. The values of `y` and `z` are within the range of 0 to 100, so `max_downvotes` will range from `0` (if both `y` and `z` are 0) to `200` (if both `y` and `z` are 100). The other variables (`x`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, and `max_downvotes` is `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
