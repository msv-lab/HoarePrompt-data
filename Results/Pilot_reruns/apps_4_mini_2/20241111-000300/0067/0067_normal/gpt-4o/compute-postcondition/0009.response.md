Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers (0 <= x <= 100, 0 <= y <= 100, 0 <= z <= 100). If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which is `y`), the output is '-'. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), the output is '+'. If neither condition is met, the output is '?', which includes situations where `max_downvotes` equals `min_upvotes` or `max_downvotes` is greater than `min_upvotes`, ensuring all relationships between upvotes and downvotes are accurately represented.***
