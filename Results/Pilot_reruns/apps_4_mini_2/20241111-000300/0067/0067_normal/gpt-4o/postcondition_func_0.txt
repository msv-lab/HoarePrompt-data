The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through user input, representing upvotes and downvotes. It determines the relationship between maximum upvotes (`x + z`) and minimum downvotes (`y`), as well as maximum downvotes (`y + z`) and minimum upvotes (`x`). The output will be '-' if maximum upvotes are less than minimum downvotes, '+' if maximum downvotes are less than minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. This ensures all potential relationships between upvotes and downvotes are considered.
