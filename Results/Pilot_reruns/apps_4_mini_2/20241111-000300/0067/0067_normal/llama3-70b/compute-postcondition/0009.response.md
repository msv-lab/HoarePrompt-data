Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100 inclusive. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, then '+' is printed. If `x` is less than `y`, then '-' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y`, if `z` is equal to 0, '0' is printed; if `z` is greater than 0, '?' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 0, '?' is printed. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged after execution.***
