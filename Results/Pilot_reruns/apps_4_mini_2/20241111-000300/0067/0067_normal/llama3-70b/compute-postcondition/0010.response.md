The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as there are no parameters defined in the function signature. Therefore, it does not take any input values directly. 

Since the output behavior is not provided in the prompt, we cannot define specific return values. However, if we were to assume it returns some value based on the given constraints (x, y, and z being integers between 0 and 100 inclusive), we would need more information regarding how these constraints are utilized within the function's logic.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and the return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
