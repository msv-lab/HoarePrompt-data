According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is 'b' and `s` is 'ac'. Since 'b' is not in 'ac', the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, the state of `s` needs to be adjusted to include 'b'.

State: **`res` is 'ab', `s` is 'abc', `char` is 'b'**
