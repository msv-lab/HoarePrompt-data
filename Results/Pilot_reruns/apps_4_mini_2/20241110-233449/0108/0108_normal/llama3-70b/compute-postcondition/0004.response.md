The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res` plus `char`. Since `res` is initially an empty string and `char` is 'a', after execution, `res` will contain the value 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
