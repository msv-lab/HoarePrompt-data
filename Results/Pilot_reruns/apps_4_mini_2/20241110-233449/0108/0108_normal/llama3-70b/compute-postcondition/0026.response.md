Output State: **`if 'b' is in s then res` is the string formed by concatenating 'b' for each occurrence of 'b' in the original string `s`, and `s` will have all occurrences of 'b' replaced by characters incremented by 1 in the ASCII table until 'b' is no longer present; `res` is updated by adding `char`, which is the next character in the alphabet.**
