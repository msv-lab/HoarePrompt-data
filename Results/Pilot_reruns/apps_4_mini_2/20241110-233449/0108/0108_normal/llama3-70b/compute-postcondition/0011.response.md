The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. Since `s` includes 'b', we need to determine the ASCII value of 'b', which is 98. The character that comes after 'b' is 'c', which has an ASCII value of 99. Therefore, the first occurrence of 'b' in `s` will be replaced with 'c'.

The variable `res` remains unchanged, and there are no other variables affected.

Output State: **`s` includes 'c', `res` is unchanged**
