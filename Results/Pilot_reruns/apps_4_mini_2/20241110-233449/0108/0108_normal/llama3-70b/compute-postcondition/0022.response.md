The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. 

The initial state has `s` as 'acc' and `char` as 'a'. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, and the next character is 'b' (ASCII value 98). 

So, the first occurrence of 'a' in 'acc' will be replaced with 'b', resulting in `s` becoming 'bcc'.

The variable `res` remains unchanged as 'abba'.

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 'abba', `s` is 'bcc', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`res` is 'abba', `s` is 'bcc', `char` is 'a'**
