Output State: **`if 'b' is in s then res` is the string formed by concatenating 'b' for each occurrence of 'b' in the original string `s` until there are no more 'b's left, and `s` will have all occurrences of 'b' replaced by characters incremented by 1 in the ASCII table until 'b' is no longer present. If 'b' is not in `s`, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains 'a', `s` remains unchanged. After the loop, `char` will eventually be the character following the last 'b' replaced in `s`.**
