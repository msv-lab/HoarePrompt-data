Functionality: ** The function accepts user input as a string consisting of lowercase English letters. It processes this string to create a new string `res` by concatenating each character found in the input for every occurrence, replacing each character with its next ASCII character after each addition. If the resulting string `res` has a length of 26 (indicating that all letters from 'a' to 'z' were present), it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function handles cases where the input string does not contain all alphabet characters, and characters outside the alphabet are ignored. If the input string is empty or consists only of non-alphabet characters, the output will be `-1`.**
