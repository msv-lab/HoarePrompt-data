Output State: **`res` is a string formed by concatenating each character from `s` for every occurrence of that character until it is no longer present, with characters being replaced by their next ASCII character in `s`. If `s` does not contain any characters from `alphabet`, `res` remains unchanged. If `s` contains characters that are not in the alphabet, they will be unaffected, and the loop will only process characters from 'a' to 'z' present in `s`. If `s` is empty, `res` remains an empty string. The statement prints -1, but does not affect the state of `res` or `s`.**
