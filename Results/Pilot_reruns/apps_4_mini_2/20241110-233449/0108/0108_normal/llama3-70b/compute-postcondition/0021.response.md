The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. The previous value of `res` is 'abb', and `char` is 'a', so after execution, `res` becomes 'abba'. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and `char` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `res` is 'abba', `s` is 'acc', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`res` is 'abba', `s` is 'acc', `char` is 'a'**
