The code assigns the values `0` to both `i` and `j`. The previous values of `i` and `j` were unknown, but now they are initialized to `0`. The states of other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a new input string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
