The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `len(s)` is greater than `i` and `target_len` is greater than `j`, but does not provide specific values for `j`. Therefore, after the execution, `j` will be increased by 1, but the exact value of `j` remains unknown. The states of `i`, `len(s)`, and `target_len` are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, `target_len` is greater than `j`, and `j` is increased by 1**
