The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions state that `len(s)` is greater than `i`, which allows for this increment to occur. The values of `j` and the conditions regarding `len(s)` and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is still greater than `i`, `target_len` is greater than `j`, and `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is still greater than `i`, `target_len` is greater than `j`, and `j` remains unchanged.**
