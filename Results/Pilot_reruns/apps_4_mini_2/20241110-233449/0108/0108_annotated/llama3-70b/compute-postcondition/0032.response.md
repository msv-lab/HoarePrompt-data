The `res` variable is updated by appending `char` to its current value. Since `char` is 'd', it will add 'd' to the end of `res`. The previous state of `res` is described as containing the sequence of characters added during the loop execution plus 'd' plus 'd'. Therefore, after execution, `res` will now include one additional 'd'.

The output state reflects the updated value of `res` along with the unchanged values of `s` and `char`.

Output State: **`s` is updated to include 'd'; `res` contains the sequence of characters added during the loop execution plus 'd' plus 'd' plus 'd'; `char` is 'd'**
