The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` (which is 'd') in the string `s` with the character that has the next ASCII value, which is 'e'. Since `s` contains processed characters with at least one 'd', after the execution, `s` will have 'd' replaced by 'e'. The values of `res` and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is updated to have 'd' replaced by 'e'; `res` contains the sequence of characters added during the loop execution plus 'd' plus 'd'; `char` is still 'd'.

Output State: **`s` is updated to have 'd' replaced by 'e'; `res` contains the sequence of characters added during the loop execution plus 'd' plus 'd'; `char` is 'd'**
