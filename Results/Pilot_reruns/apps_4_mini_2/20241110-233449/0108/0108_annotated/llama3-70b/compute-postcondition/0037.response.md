Output State: **If `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` will contain all characters from `s` in order, each character appearing as many times as it originally did in `s`, replaced sequentially with the next character in the alphabet. The variable `s` will be modified such that each instance of a character is replaced with the next character ('a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on). If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string while `s` remains unchanged. At the end, if `char` exceeds 'z', it will not affect `s` or `res` anymore. Therefore, after the loop completes, `res` will contain the sequence of characters added during the loop execution, and `s` will contain the characters processed and replaced accordingly.**
