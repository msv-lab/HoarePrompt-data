`res` is assigned the value of `res + char`, where `res` is 'a' and `char` is also 'a'. Therefore, `res` becomes 'aa'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
