The code `s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)` replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes immediately after `char` in the Unicode character set. The value of `char` is incremented by 1 using `ord(char) + 1`, and then converted back to a character with `chr()`. 

Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, it will be replaced by its next character, while `res` is updated to include `char` but remains unchanged in this snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character, `res` includes `char`.

Output State: **`s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character, `res` includes `char`**
