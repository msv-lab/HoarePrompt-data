The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the next character in the alphabet (which is determined by `chr(ord(char) + 1)`). The original string `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', and `res` is updated to include `char`. 

Let's analyze the variables:
- `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `char` is the character that will be replaced by the next character.

After executing the line of code:
- The character `char` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet in `s`. 

Therefore, the output state would reflect that `s` has been updated to include the next character in place of `char`, but without specific values for `s` or `char`, we cannot define the exact character or string. Thus, it is sufficient to mention that `s` has changed.

Output State: **`s` is updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet.**
