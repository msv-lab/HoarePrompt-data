`res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. The previous value of `res` is 'aa', and the value of `char` is 'a', so after execution, `res` becomes 'aaa'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one 'b' (with one 'a' replaced), `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'b' (with one 'a' replaced), `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'**
