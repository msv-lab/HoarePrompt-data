Postcondition: ***If `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` will contain all characters from `s`, each replaced with the next character in the alphabet, and the function prints `res`. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', `s` remains unchanged, `res` remains an empty string, and the function prints -1. Additionally, if any character in `s` exceeds 'z', it will not affect `s` or `res`.***
