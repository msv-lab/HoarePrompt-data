Functionality: ** The function reads an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, processes it to create a new string `res` that contains each character from `s` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If `res` contains all 26 letters from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, it prints the string `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. If the input string contains characters outside of 'a' to 'z', those characters are ignored during processing, and they do not affect the output. If the input does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z', the function will print -1.**
