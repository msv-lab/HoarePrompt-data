The variable `res` is being concatenated with the value of `char`, which is assumed to be a character from `s`. Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, `res` will now include `char` at least once. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it will be updated to include `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`; `res` is updated to include `char`**
