The operation `res += char` appends the character `char`, which is 'd', to the end of the string `res`. The variable `res` will now include an additional 'd' at the end of its current value. The variable `s` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`s` contains processed characters with at least one 'd'; `res` contains the sequence of characters added during the loop execution plus 'd' plus 'd'; `char` is 'd'**
