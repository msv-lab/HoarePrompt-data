The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. Other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, and `i` is 2**
