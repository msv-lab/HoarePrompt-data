The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Since `s` is already defined as a string, it will now hold the value entered by the user. The length of `s` will be between 1 and 100,000 characters. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000**
