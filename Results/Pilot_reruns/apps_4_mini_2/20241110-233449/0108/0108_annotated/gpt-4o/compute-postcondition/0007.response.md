According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(s)` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `len(s)` is between 1 and 100,000 (thus greater than 1), and `j` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must remain less than `len(s)` (which it does, since `len(s)` is greater than 1) and `j` must be less than `target_len` (which is 26).

Since there are no adjustments needed to ensure that both conditions for the loop to execute again are satisfied, we can repeat the program state as it is.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` remains unchanged.**
