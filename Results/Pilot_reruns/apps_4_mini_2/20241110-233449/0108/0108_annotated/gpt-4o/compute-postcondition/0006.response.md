The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. The values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` remains unchanged.**
