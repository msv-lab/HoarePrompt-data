According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. 

Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is incremented. After the next iteration, `i` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to 2, while `n` remains unchanged (as it still satisfies the condition for the loop to run).

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions regarding `used_cubes[1]` and `digit` do not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `i` is 2**
