Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`. If `digit` was not found in any `cube_faces` where `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, then `found` remains `False`, and the function returns False. If `digit` is found, then `found` would be True, and the return statement would not be executed. However, since this condition check is executed, it confirms that the function returns False in the case where `found` remains unchanged.***
