The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character; `i` is 1; `used_cubes[1]` is True; `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
