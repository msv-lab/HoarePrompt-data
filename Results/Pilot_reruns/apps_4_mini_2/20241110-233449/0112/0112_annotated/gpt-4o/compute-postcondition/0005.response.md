The value at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list is set to `True`. Since `i` is initialized to 0, the first element of `used_cubes` (which was initially `False`) is now updated to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the first element as `True`, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the first element as `True`, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
