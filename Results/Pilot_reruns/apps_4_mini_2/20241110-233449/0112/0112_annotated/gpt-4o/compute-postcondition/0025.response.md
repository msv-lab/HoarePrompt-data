According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. The loop will continue to execute for each character in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 characters, and `digit` is the second character in the list. Since the loop iterates over each character in the list, for the loop to execute one more time, `digit` should be updated to the next character in the list.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, we know that the length of `digits` can be at least 2 but not more than 3. If `digit` is currently the second character, then for the loop to iterate again, `digit` should become the third character, and thus the index should be increased accordingly.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `digit` should be the third character in the list.
- The loop will keep iterating as long as `digits` contains at least 3 characters.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters; `digit` is the third character in the list; `found` is False**
