The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is an integer. The function also utilizes a list `cube_faces`, where each `cube_faces[i]` is a list of 6 integers, constrained such that each integer is between 0 and 9 and `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3\). 

After executing the function body, there are two possible cases for the return value:

Case_1: If `digits` is a list with at least one character, the function checks if each digit can be matched with the cubes. If any digit cannot be matched, the function returns `False`. If `digits` is empty, the function does not execute the matching loop, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged.

Case_2: If all digits can be matched successfully, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and determine whether it can be formed using the digits from the provided cube faces, returning `True` if successful and `False` if any digit cannot be matched. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num and determines if it can be formed using the digits from the provided cube faces. It returns True if all digits can be matched, otherwise it returns False.**
