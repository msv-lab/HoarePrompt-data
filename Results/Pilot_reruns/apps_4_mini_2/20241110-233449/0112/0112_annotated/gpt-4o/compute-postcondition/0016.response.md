The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change. The state of `n` and `digits` remains the same, and `used_cubes[2]` is still `True`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes[2]` is True, and `found` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes[2]` is True, and `found` is True**
