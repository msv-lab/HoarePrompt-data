Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character; if `n` is at least 1 and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`, the loop will execute at most `n` times. If `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]` for any index `i` where `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the loop breaks. If `digit` is not found in any `cube_faces` for the valid indices or if all corresponding `used_cubes` are already `True`, then `found` remains `False` and `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 or negative (though according to the initial state it cannot be), the loop does not execute.**
