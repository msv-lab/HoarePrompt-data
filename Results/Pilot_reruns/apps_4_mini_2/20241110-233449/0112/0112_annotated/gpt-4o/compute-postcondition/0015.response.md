The code assigns `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. Given that `i` is 2, the value at index 2 of `used_cubes` is set to `True`. The values of `n` and `digits` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes[2]` is True**
