Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character; if the value at index `i` of `used_cubes` is `False` and `digit` is found within `cube_faces[i]`, then the corresponding entry in `used_cubes` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` stays `False`.***
