According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The `used_cubes` list has a length of `n`, indicating that it will have valid indices for the loop iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be at most `n - 1`, and the loop will iterate starting from `i = 0`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1, and before the loop starts, the values of `i`, `digit`, and `found` should be initialized properly. Specifically, `i` should start at 0, `digit` is already the first character in the `digits` list, and `found` is False at the beginning.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` containing `False` values, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
