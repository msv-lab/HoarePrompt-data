The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes[2]` is True, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
