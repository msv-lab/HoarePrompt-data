According to the code, the loop iterates over the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the `cubes` list must contain additional lists. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `cubes` has at least 3 lists and that `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. This means that after processing the third list, the next iteration would attempt to access the fourth list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 4 lists, and `cube` should be the fourth list in `cubes`.

Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it does not directly affect the number of iterations of the loop, but we can assume that `n` could be updated to reflect that there are at least 4 lists in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 4 lists, `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
