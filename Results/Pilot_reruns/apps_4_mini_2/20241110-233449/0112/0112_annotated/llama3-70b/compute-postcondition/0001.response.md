The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists created by taking `n` inputs, each split into integers. The value of `n` can be either 1, 2, or 3, which determines how many lists will be generated. Each inner list will contain integers based on the input provided. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input**
