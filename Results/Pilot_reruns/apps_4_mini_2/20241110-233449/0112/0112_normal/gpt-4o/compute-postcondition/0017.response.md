The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digits` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is equal to the last value of `i` (which is less than `n`) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
