Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` remains True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, the state of `used_cubes`, `digits`, and `found` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` remains the same (which is less than `n`).***
