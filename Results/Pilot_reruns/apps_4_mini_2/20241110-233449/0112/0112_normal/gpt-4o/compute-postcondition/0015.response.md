The code assigns the value `True` to the element at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list. The value of `i` is equal to the last value of `i`, which is less than `n`, and since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` can be 0 or 1. The state of `used_cubes` changes at the index `i`, but other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digits` remains unchanged, `found` remains True, `i` is equal to the last value of `i` (which is less than `n`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digits` remains unchanged, `found` remains True, `i` is equal to the last value of `i` (which is less than `n`.**
