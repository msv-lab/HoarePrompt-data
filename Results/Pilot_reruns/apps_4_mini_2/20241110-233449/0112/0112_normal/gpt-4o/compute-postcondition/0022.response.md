Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is still False, `digits` remains unchanged, and `i` is 0. If a match was not found, the function returns False, indicating that no match exists in the current state of the cubes. If the loop does not execute due to all `used_cubes[i]` being True or `digit` not being present in any of `cube_faces[i]`, the variables remain unchanged, and the function still returns False.***
