The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is updated with the second element as `True`, `digits` is unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
