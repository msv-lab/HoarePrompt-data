The code takes an integer variable `num` and converts it to a string using `str(num)`, then creates a list of its digits by using `list()`. The output of this operation will depend on the specific value of `num`, which is not provided. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we don't have the specific value of `num` to determine the digits.

However, since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot derive the output state clearly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, where `num` is not defined**.
