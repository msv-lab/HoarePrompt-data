The value of `found` is assigned `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state, so its value remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is updated with the second element as `True`, `digits` is unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is updated with the second element as `True`, `digits` is unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1**
