The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of `n`, `used_cubes`, and `digits`, along with the new value of `found`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is False**
