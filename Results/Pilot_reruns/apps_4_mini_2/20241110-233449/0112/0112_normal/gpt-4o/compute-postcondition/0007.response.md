The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list with the first element set to True and the rest unchanged; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element; `found` is True; `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
