The assignment `found = False` sets the variable `found` to `False`. The previous value of `found` was already `False`, so there is no change in its state. The other variables `used_cubes`, `digits`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `digits` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `digit` is the third digit in the collection**
