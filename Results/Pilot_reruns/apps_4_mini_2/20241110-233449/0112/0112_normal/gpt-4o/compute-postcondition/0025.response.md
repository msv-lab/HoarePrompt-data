According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` collection. In this case, since `i` is 1 and `digit` is the second digit in the collection, it implies that there is at least one more digit after the second one. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is updated to reflect the current index of the digit being processed, and `digit` needs to refer to the next digit in the collection.

Thus, if `i` is currently 1, it indicates that we are currently processing the second digit (index 1), which means for the next iteration of the loop, `i` should be incremented to 2, and `digit` should refer to the third digit in the collection.

State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `digits` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `digit` is the third digit in the collection**
