The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` lists of integers (each integer between 0 and 9). It returns an integer `x` that represents the largest consecutive number starting from 1 that can be formed using the integers in the provided lists. The value of `x` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on whether the numbers can be formed. If no numbers can be formed, `x` will be 0.
