The code creates a list called `cubes` that contains `n` sublists, each of which is populated by integers obtained from user input. The value of `n` can be either 1, 2, or 3. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial value of `n` and indicates that `cubes` has been created from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` sublists populated with integers from user input.**
