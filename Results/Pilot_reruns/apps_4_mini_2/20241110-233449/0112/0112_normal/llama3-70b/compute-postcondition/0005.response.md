According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` has more than one sublist, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, meaning `cubes` contains at least 1 sublist. Since `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`, for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 2 sublists, and `cube` should then refer to the second sublist. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 2 (indicating there are at least 2 sublists).
- `cube` should be the second sublist in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `cubes` is a list of at least 2 sublists populated with integers, `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`, `digits` is a set containing string representations of integers from the second sublist `cube`.**
