The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial condition states that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, so the value of `n` will be either 1, 2, or 3. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
