The code assigns values to `a`, `b`, and `c` based on user input, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are replaced with the new input values, which can be any integers within the specified limits. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned new integer values based on user input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned new integer values based on user input**
