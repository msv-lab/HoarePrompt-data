The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged; printed output is 'NO'**
