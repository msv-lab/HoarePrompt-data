The code prints 'NO' to the output. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is that `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their previously assigned values based on user input, and the program outputs 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned new integer values based on user input, and the program outputs 'NO'**.
