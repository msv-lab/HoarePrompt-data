The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged integer values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values from input, and the output is 'YES'**
