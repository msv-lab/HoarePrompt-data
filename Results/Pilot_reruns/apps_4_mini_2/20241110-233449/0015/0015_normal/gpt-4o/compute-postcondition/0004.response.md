The code prints 'NO', but does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state is that `a`, `b`, and `c` are still integers assigned new values from input, and the message 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values from input, and 'NO' is printed**
