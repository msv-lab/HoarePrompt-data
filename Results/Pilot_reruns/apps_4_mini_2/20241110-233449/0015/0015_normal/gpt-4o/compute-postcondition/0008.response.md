The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the output description, it is implied that the function should handle or utilize the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained to the range of -10^9 to 10^9. However, since no specific output or return value is provided in the output section, we cannot determine the exact functionality of the function concerning these parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func`, as described, is not explicitly defined in terms of its return values or behavior based on `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not return any specific output as the functionality is not defined based on the provided information.**
