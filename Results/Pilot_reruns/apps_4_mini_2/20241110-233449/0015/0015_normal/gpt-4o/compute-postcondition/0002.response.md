The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` hold integer values from input, but their states do not change as a result of this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values from input, and the function prints 'NO'**
