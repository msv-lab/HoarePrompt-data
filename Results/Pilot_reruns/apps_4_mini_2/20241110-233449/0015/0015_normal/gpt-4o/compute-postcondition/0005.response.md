Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values from input. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This encompasses the cases where `c` is positive, zero, or negative, including scenarios where `b` is equal to `a`, resulting in a division of zero or a negative outcome.***
