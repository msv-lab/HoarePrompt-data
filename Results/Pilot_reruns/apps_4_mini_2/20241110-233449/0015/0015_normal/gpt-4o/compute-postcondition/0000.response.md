The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input split into three parts. Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine their new values after the execution of the code. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values from input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values from input**
