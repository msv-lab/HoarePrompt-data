To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code in relation to the requirements set forth.

### Problem Description Recap:
The sequence `s` is defined such that:
- The first element is `s_1 = a`.
- The difference between neighboring elements is `c`.
- We need to determine if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Program Analysis:
The code reads integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, then proceeds with the following checks:
1. If `b` equals `a`, it prints "YES" since `b` is the first element.
2. If `c` equals `0`, it prints "NO" since if `c` is `0`, the sequence does not progress from `a`.
3. If `c` is not `0`, it checks:
   - If `(b - a) % c == 0` indicating that `b` can be expressed as `a + k*c` for some integer `k`.
   - If `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that `k` is non-negative, meaning `b` must not come before `a` in the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `c` is positive**: The sequence will increase from `a`. Here, the checks seem to work correctly.
2. **When `c` is negative**: The sequence will decrease from `a`. The checks still apply as they will correctly determine if `b` can be reached.
3. **When `c` is `0`**:
   - The program correctly handles this case by returning "NO" unless `b` is equal to `a`.
4. **When `b` is less than `a` with a positive `c`**: The check `(b - a) / c >= 0` will fail, returning "NO" correctly.
5. **When `b` is greater than `a` with a negative `c`**: The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` will fail, returning "NO" correctly.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints summarize the logic of the program and mention that it covers all scenarios for `c` being positive, negative, or zero. They align with the code's logic and capture the essence of the checks made.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the code against the requirements of the problem description and considering the output hints, I find that the code correctly addresses all potential cases as described. There are no edge cases where it fails to meet the problem description.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
