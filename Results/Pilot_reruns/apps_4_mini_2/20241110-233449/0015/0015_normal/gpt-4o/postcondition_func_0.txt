The function accepts three integer values from user input (a, b, and c). It prints 'YES' if b equals a. If b does not equal a and c equals 0, it prints 'NO'. If c is not zero, it checks if the difference (b - a) is divisible by c and if (b - a) / c is non-negative, printing 'YES' if both conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This covers all scenarios for the values of a, b, and c, including cases where c is positive, negative, or zero.
