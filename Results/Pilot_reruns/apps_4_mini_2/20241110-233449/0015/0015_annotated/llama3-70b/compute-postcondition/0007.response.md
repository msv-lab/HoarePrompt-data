Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers in the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and `(b - a) % c` equals 0 with `(b - a) / c` being non-negative, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c` and the division result is non-negative. If this condition is not met, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not a multiple of `c` or the division yields a negative result. This captures all necessary edge cases regarding the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, including scenarios where `c` is zero, positive, or negative.***
