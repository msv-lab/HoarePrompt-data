The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation, and since they were assigned integer values from input, they remain as they are. Therefore, the output state includes the original values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, and the output is 'YES'**
