To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description and the annotations, letâ€™s analyze the requirements and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
The program needs to determine if a number \( b \) appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence defined by:
- The first element \( s_1 = a \)
- The common difference \( c \) such that the \( i \)-th term is given by \( s_i = a + (i-1) \cdot c \)

The goal is to check if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).

### Key Cases to Consider
1. **When \( b = a \)**: The output should be "YES" since the first term is \( a \).
2. **When \( c = 0 \)**: The sequence is constant; it will only contain the value \( a \). Thus:
   - If \( b = a \), output "YES".
   - If \( b \neq a \), output "NO".
3. **When \( c \neq 0 \)**: The value of \( b \) can be checked using the formula:
   - \( b = a + (i-1) \cdot c \) can be rearranged to:
   - \( (b - a) \% c = 0 \) and \( (b - a) / c \geq 0 \) which ensures that:
     - The difference \( (b - a) \) is a multiple of \( c \) (meaning \( b \) can be reached from \( a \) by steps of size \( c \)).
     - The division result is non-negative, ensuring \( i \) is positive.

### Code Analysis
The provided code implements these checks logically:
- It checks if \( b = a \) first and outputs "YES".
- It then checks if \( c = 0 \) and outputs "NO" if \( b \) is not equal to \( a \).
- For cases where \( c \neq 0 \), it checks the conditions for \( b \) to be reachable from \( a \).

### Annotations Review
The annotations confirm the flow of logic:
- They indicate that if \( c = 0 \) and \( b \neq a \), "NO" is printed.
- For \( c \neq 0 \), it checks if \( (b - a) \% c == 0 \) and if \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Example with Negative \( c \)**:
   - Input: \( a = 1, b = -4, c = 5 \)
   - Expected Output: "NO"
   - The code correctly identifies that \( b \) is not reachable from \( a \) with a positive step size \( c \).

2. **Case with Large Values**:
   - Input: \( a = 10^9, b = 10^9, c = 0 \)
   - Expected Output: "YES"
   - The code handles large integers correctly, per Python's integer handling.

### Conclusion
After thorough analysis, the code adheres to the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly. The annotations align with the logic in the code, confirming that all necessary conditions are checked.

Thus, the final determination is:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly determines whether \( b \) appears in the defined sequence for all potential input cases as described in the problem statement.
