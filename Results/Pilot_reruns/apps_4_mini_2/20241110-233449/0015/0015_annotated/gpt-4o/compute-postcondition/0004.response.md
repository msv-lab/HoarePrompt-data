The code prints 'NO', which does not alter the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as the three integers assigned from input. The output state indicates that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged, and the output includes the printed message.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers from input, and 'NO' is printed**.
