Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not 0 and the difference between `b` and `a` is a non-negative multiple of `c`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not a multiple of `c` or it is negative. The edge case where `c` is zero is explicitly handled by printing 'NO' to avoid division errors.***
