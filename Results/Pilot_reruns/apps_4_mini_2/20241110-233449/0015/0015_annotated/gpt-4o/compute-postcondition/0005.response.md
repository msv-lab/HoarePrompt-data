Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, the output is 'YES', indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a non-negative multiple of `c`. Otherwise, the output is 'NO', indicating that either the difference is not a multiple of `c` or it is negative. This includes the edge case where `c` is zero, which would lead to a division error if `(b - a) != 0`, as such cases are not explicitly handled in the provided logic.***
