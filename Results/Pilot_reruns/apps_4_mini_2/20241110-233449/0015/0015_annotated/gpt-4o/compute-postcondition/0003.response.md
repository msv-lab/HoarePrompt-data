The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The values of variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers from input, and the output is 'YES'**
