Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the difference `c`. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **When `c == 0`**: 
   - The sequence is constant (all elements are equal to `a`). The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This is correct as the sequence does not change.

2. **When `c != 0`**: 
   - The program checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by checking two conditions:
     - `(b - a) % c == 0`: This checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, meaning that `b` can be expressed as an element in the arithmetic sequence.
     - `(b - a) / c >= 0`: This ensures that the index `i` (derived from the formula) is positive, meaning that `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` when `c` is positive, or less than or equal to `a` when `c` is negative.

These checks cover all potential edge cases outlined in the problem description. The program outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly based on the derived conditions, thus meeting the requirements of the problem statement.

As there are no potential cases found where the program fails, the conclusion is that it is indeed correct.
