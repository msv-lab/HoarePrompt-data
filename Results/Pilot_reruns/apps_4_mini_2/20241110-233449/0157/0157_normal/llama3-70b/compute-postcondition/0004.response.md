To calculate the output state, we first need to recognize that `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be simplified:
- This expression can be factored as `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)` which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

Since `min_lemon` is dependent on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state will denote this relationship:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4; the output is min_lemon * 7**
