The value of `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The variables `a` and `b` are input integers, and `c` is a positive integer as per user input. The output state will reflect the values of these variables along with the computed value of `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
