The value of `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, and `c` also remains unchanged as it is a positive integer. The output state reflects that `b` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
