The code prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is already calculated as `max_lemons * 7`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and `max_lemons` is determined by the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The variable `total_fruits` holds the result of `max_lemons * 7`. Since the print statement does not alter any variable states, the output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7**
