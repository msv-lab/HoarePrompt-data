To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer (new value)
- `c` is an input integer
- `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

The code snippet performs the following operation:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

1. The variable `max_lemons` is already defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This means `max_lemons` will hold the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`.
2. The code then calculates `total_fruits` using the value of `max_lemons`. Specifically, it computes:
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This simplifies to:
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
   ```

Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and `max_lemons` is derived from them, we can express the output state based on the calculations made:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7**
