To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and initial values:

The code:
```
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```

Step 1: The function `min()` calculates the minimum value among the three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Step 2: `b // 2` performs integer division on `b`, which means it divides `b` by 2 and discards any remainder.

Step 3: `c // 4` similarly performs integer division on `c`, dividing `c` by 4 and discarding any remainder.

Step 4: The values of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` are compared, and the smallest of these three values is assigned to `min_lemon`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are all input integers, the values can vary, but the specific calculation will depend on the values provided at runtime. However, we know that the state of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` does not change; only `min_lemon` is assigned a new value based on the minimum calculation.

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the new variable `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
