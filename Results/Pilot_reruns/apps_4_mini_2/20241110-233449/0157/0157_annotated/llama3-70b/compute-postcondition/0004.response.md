To determine the output state, we first need to calculate `min_lemon`. The value of `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. We will denote `min_lemon` as `m` for simplicity in the calculations.

Next, we compute the expression that is printed:
```
print(m + m * 2 + m * 4)
```
This simplifies to:
```
m + 2m + 4m = 7m
```
Thus, the output will be `7 * min_lemon`.

Now, we summarize the output state:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the output is `7 * min_lemon`.**
