The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It works with the assumption that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. However, since the output is not specified in the provided information, we cannot detail the return value. Therefore, based on the given parameters, we can only state the constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates under the assumption that a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The return value is not specified.**
