To determine the output state, we first analyze the code snippet provided. The code calculates `max_lemons` using the `min` function applied to three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

1. `a` is an input integer.
2. `b // 2` calculates the integer division of `b` by 2.
3. `c // 4` calculates the integer division of `c` by 4.

The `min` function will take the smallest of these three values. Since we don't have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `max_lemons`. However, we know the relationship of these variables based on their definitions.

Thus, the output state will reflect the initial input integers and the calculated variable:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`)**
