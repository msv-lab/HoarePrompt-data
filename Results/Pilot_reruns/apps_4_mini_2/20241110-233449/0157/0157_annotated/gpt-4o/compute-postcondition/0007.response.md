Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers as input from the user: `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the maximum number of "lemons" that can be produced based on the constraints determined by the inputs, specifically that it can make at most `a` lemons, half of `b`, or a quarter of `c`. The total number of fruits produced is then calculated as `max_lemons * 7`, and this value is printed. The function does not return any value. **
