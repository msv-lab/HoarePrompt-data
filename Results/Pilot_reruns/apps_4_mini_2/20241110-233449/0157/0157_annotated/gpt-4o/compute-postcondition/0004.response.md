To determine the output state, we first need to calculate the value of `max_lemons` based on the initial state and then compute `total_fruits`.

1. `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This means we take the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and one-fourth of `c`.
2. Once we have the value of `max_lemons`, we can calculate `total_fruits` using the formula: 
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This simplifies to:
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
   ```

The output state will reflect the calculated values of `max_lemons` and `total_fruits`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, their specific values are not known, but we can state the relationships clearly.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`), `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**
