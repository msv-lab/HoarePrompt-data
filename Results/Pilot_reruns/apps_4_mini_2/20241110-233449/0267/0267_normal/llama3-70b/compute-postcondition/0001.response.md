Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is within the valid range (1 to 10), the function does not return anything, and the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
