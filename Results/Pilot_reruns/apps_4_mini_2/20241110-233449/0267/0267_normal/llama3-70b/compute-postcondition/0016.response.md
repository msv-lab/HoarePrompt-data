Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is between 1 and 10 and if the tuple `(n, k)` exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns `dp[n, k]`. If `n` < 10 ** k, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. If `n` >= 10 ** k`, and if `k` is greater than 1, then `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculations involving powers of 10 and is taken modulo `MOD`. If `k` is less than or equal to 1, `dp[n, k]` remains unchanged. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the process.***
