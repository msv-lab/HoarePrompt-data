The expression updates `dp[n, k]` by adding a calculated value. Given that `k` is greater than or equal to 3 and `i` is 3, we can break down the calculation:

1. **Calculate `i - 1`:** Since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2.
2. **Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`:** This results in `10 ** 2`, which equals 100.
3. **Calculate `k - i`:** Since `k` is at least 3 and `i` is also 3, `k - i` is at least 0.
4. **Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`:** This value will depend on the specific value of `k`, but it will be at least 1 (when `k = 3`).
5. **Calculate `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)`:** This will be `10 ** (k - 3) - 100`.
6. **Final Calculation for the added value:** The term `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` becomes `9 * 100 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`.

The overall state of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the values of `i` and `k`, impacting only `dp[n, k]`, while `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 100 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`**
