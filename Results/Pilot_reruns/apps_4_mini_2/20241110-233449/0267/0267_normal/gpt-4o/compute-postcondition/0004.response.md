According to the code, the loop iterates over `num` starting from `l` to `r`, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be within the range defined by `l` and `r`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\).
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\).
- `num` is equal to `l` in the last iteration.

In this context, if the last iteration used `num = l`, for the loop to execute again, `num` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `num` should now be equal to `l + 1`. Additionally, since `num` must still be less than or equal to `r`, it follows that `l + 1` must also be less than or equal to `r`. This means that `r` must be adjusted to at least `l + 1` for the loop to run again.

Thus, the adjusted states will be:
- `num` is `l + 1`
- `r` is at least `l + 1`

So, the final state will be:
State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r - 1` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l + 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, `total_sum` remains 0**
