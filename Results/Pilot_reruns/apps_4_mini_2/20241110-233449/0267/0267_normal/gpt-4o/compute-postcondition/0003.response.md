Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD` if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, where `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains 0.***
