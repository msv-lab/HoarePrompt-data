Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r - 1` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l + 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, and `total_sum` remains 0 initially. After executing the if statement, if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `total_sum` takes the value of `num % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0.***
