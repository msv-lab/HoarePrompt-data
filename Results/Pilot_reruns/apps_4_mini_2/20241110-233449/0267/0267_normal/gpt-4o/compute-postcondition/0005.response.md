In the given code snippet, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to its current value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial state indicates that `total_sum` is 0. However, the value of `num` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contribution. The output will reflect that `total_sum` has changed but cannot specify the new value.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r - 1` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l + 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, `total_sum` is updated to (0 + num) % MOD, but the value of num is unknown.**
