To evaluate the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact on the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State: `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value 9, `i` is 1.

In the code snippet:
```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
```

1. We start with `dp[n, k] = 9`.
2. The value of `i` is 1, so we calculate:
   - `10 ** (i - 1) = 10 ** (1 - 1) = 10 ** 0 = 1`
   - `10 ** (k - i) = 10 ** (2 - 1) = 10 ** 1 = 10`
   - `10 ** (i - 1) = 10 ** (1 - 1) = 10 ** 0 = 1`
3. Now we can substitute these values into the equation:
   - `dp[n, k] += 9 * 1 * (10 - 1)`
   - This simplifies to:
   - `dp[n, k] += 9 * 1 * 9`
   - `dp[n, k] += 81`
4. Therefore, the new value of `dp[n, k]` is `9 + 81 = 90`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is 90, `i` is 1**
