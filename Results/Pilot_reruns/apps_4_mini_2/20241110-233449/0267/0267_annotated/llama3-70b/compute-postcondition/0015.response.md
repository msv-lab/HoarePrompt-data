Output State: **If `k` is 1, then `dp[n, k]` is 9; if `k` is 2, then `dp[n, k]` is 90 after 1 iteration; if `k` is 3, then `dp[n, k]` is -720 after 2 iterations; if `k` is 4, then `i` is 3; for `k` values 5 to 10, the loop executes `k - 1` times, updating `dp[n, k]` each time. The operation `dp[n, k] %= MOD` ensures that `dp[n, k]` is updated to be within the bounds of `MOD`.**
