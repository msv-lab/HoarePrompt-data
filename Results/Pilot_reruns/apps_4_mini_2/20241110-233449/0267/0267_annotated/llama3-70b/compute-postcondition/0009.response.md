To determine the new state after executing the code, we will analyze the operation step by step.

1. **Initial State Values**:
   - `dp[n, k]` is 90
   - `k` is 2
   - `i` is 2

2. **Calculating the Formula**:
   - The formula being executed is:
     ```
     dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
     ```
   - Substituting in the values:
     - `i - 1` = 2 - 1 = 1
     - `k - i` = 2 - 2 = 0
   - Thus, we can calculate each part:
     - `10 ** (i - 1)` = `10 ** 1` = 10
     - `10 ** (k - i)` = `10 ** 0` = 1
     - `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` = 1 - 10 = -9
   - Now substituting back into the formula:
     - `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (-9)`
     - `= dp[n, k] += -810`
   - Therefore:
     - `dp[n, k]` = 90 - 810 = -720

3. **Output State**:
   - Since only `dp[n, k]` has been modified, the output state will reflect its new value, along with the unchanged values of `l`, `r`, and `k`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is -720, `i` is 2**
