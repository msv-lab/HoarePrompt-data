Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the pair `(n, k)` exists in `dp`, the function returns `dp[n, k]`, leaving the state of the variables unchanged. If `n` is less than `10 ** k`, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is initially set to 9, and for `k` values from 2 to 10, the function calculates the updates in a loop, ultimately adjusting the value of `dp[n, k]` within the bounds of `MOD`, ensuring that the final value reflects the calculations based on the range of `n` and `k`.***
