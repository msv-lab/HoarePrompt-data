Correctness: **False**

The provided code has a fundamental issue that violates the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the number of unique digits in a number `n` is less than or equal to `k`. However, it does not account for the case where `k` is equal to the number of unique digits. The problem explicitly states that numbers must contain "at most `k` different digits", which implies that `k` can be equal to the number of unique digits, but the condition in `func_1` should not allow for more than `k` unique digits.

Additionally, the implementation iterates through the entire range from `l` to `r`, which is inefficient for large values, especially since `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\). While this does not directly affect correctness, it raises concerns about performance given the constraints.

Furthermore, the annotation for `func_1` states that it returns a boolean indicating whether the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`, but the code does not explicitly verify if the length of the unique digits matches the exact requirements of the problem statement.

A specific case where the program fails is if we consider an input where `l = 100`, `r = 110`, and `k = 2`. The numbers `100`, `101`, `102`, `103`, `104`, `105`, `106`, `107`, `108`, `109`, and `110` all have at most 2 different digits. The expected sum in this case would be `100 + 101 + 102 + 103 + 104 + 105 + 106 + 107 + 108 + 109 + 110 = 1155`. However, the actual implementation might incorrectly include or exclude certain numbers based on the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
