Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` that define a range, and an integer `k`. It returns the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition specified by the function `func_1(num, k)`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the sum remains 0, and if none of the integers in the range satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, the sum will also be 0.**
