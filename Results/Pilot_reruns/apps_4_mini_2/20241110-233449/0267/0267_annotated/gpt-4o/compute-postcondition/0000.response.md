The variable `total_sum` is assigned the initial value of `0`. The values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0**
