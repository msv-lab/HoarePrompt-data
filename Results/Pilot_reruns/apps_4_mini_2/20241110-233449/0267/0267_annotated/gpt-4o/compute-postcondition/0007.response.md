According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop iterates from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l` (since it starts from `l`), and it will take values up to `r + 1`.

To execute the loop one more time, `num` must be incremented to the next value in the range. Since the loop iterates through `range(l, r + 1)`, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be `l + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue until `num` exceeds `r`.

Currently, `l` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r`, and `r` is also in the valid range where `l <= r < 10^18`. The loop will execute for `num` values from `l` to `r` inclusive. If `num` is at `r` at the end of the last iteration, it will need to be adjusted to `num` being `r + 1` to indicate the next state outside the loop's range.

Since `total_sum` is initially 0 and will only be modified if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, but we are only concerned with the state of `num` and the range it operates in for the next possible iteration.

Therefore, to execute one more time, we can state that `num` should be set to `l` (the starting point) at the beginning of the loop. Since `num` would normally only increment by 1 in the next iteration, the state needs to reflect that `num` has reached `r`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `r + 1`**
