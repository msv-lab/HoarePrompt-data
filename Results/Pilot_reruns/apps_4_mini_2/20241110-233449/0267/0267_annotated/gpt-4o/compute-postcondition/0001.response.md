According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, which is already guaranteed by the given state (1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18). 

At the start of the loop, `num` will take the value of `l`, which is the first number in the range. Since `total_sum` is initialized to 0 and does not affect the loop execution directly, no adjustments are needed for it to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the values of `l` and `r` are already valid, and `num` will start at `l`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
