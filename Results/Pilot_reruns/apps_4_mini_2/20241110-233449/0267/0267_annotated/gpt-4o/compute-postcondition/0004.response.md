According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` has taken the value of `l`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` and `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, if the loop has just finished executing with `num` equal to `l`, then `num` would need to be incremented to `l + 1` for the next iteration.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `num` should be updated to `l + 1` to allow for the next iteration of the loop.

Since `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0 (as it only updates if `func_1(num, k)` returns true), it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l + 1`**
