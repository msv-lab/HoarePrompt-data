According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is `r + 1`, which is outside the range defined by `l` and `r`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be adjusted back to `l` and `r` must be at least `l`. 

Since `num` starts at `l`, the next value of `num` should be `l`, and `r` should remain the same. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is `l`**
