To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations.

### Problem Description:
Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wants to change it to a triangle of side length `y`. The constraints are:
- In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the triangle.
- The triangle must remain a non-degenerate triangle with integer side lengths.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds to change the triangle from side `x` to side `y`.

### Code Analysis:
The code provided is:
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))
```

### Annotations:
1. The first annotation mentions that `x` and `y` are updated to new integer values based on input, maintaining the condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.
2. The second annotation states that the output is `x - y`, and it prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`.

### Evaluation of the Code:
1. The output of the function is `abs(x - y)`, which calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. This implies that the function simply gives the difference in lengths without considering the process of changing the triangle sides, which is crucial for this problem.
   
2. The problem requires the minimum number of seconds to transform the triangle, which involves understanding how many operations are necessary to adjust each side to reach the target configuration.

### Examples from the Problem:
- For input `6 3`, the expected output is `4`. 
  - The actual sequence of modifications (as noted in the example) takes several steps to achieve the new triangle, not just a simple subtraction.
  
- For input `8 5`, the expected output is `3`, which again cannot be derived simply from `abs(8 - 5)`.

- For input `22 4`, the expected output is `6`, which is achieved through multiple adjustments as per the given example.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the minimum number of seconds needed. It only computes the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not take into account the necessary steps and the constraints of maintaining a non-degenerate triangle.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not follow the problem description since it does not provide the correct logic to determine the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the target triangle length `y` from `x`. Instead, it merely returns the absolute difference, which is insufficient for solving the problem.
