The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the condition that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), we know that `x` and `y` are both integers, and `x` is always greater than `y`. Therefore, `abs(x - y)` simplifies to \(x - y\).

Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but are constrained by the given conditions, the output will be stated in terms of their relationship.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, and the output is `x - y`**
