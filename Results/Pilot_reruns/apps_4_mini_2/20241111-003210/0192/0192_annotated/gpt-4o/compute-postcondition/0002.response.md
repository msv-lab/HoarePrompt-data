The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input. However, based on the constraints provided, `x` and `y` are expected to be integers with the conditions that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function's output is not specified in the given constraints or relationships. Therefore, without additional information on the output of the function, we cannot establish what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly and the output is unspecified based on the provided information. However, it operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
