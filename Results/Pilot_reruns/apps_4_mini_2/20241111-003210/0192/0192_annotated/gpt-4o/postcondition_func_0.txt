The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` through user input, where the constraints are that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. It calculates and prints the result of the expression ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2), which effectively computes the ceiling of (x - y) / 2. There are no return values, and the function handles only valid input according to the specified constraints.
