The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. However, the specific output or return value of the function based on these parameters is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described without additional information regarding the output based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the return value based on these parameters is not specified.**
