The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are values taken from input with the conditions that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we will denote `d` as the absolute difference, which is `|x - y|`. Given that `y` is always less than `x`, it simplifies to `x - y`. 

The output state reflects that the absolute difference is calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are assigned values from input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; and the absolute difference `|x - y|` is printed.**
