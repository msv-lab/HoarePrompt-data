Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. It calculates and prints the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. The function does not return any value. **
