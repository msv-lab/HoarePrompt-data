The values of `x` and `y` are replaced by the values obtained from the input, which are integers derived from `input().split()`. Since `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, their exact values will depend on the provided input. Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are replaced with input integers satisfying the condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are replaced with input integers satisfying the condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`**
