To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program against the requirements:

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: Two integers `x` and `y` where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.
2. **Output**: The minimum number of seconds required to modify an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to a triangle of side length `y`.
3. **Operations**: Each operation modifies the length of a single side while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (which means the lengths must maintain positive values and satisfy the triangle inequalities).

### Given Program
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Analyzing the Program
- The program calculates the difference `x - y`, which represents how much we need to reduce the side length.
- It divides this difference by `2` and adds `1` if the difference is odd (using `(x - y) % 2`).
  
### Test Cases
1. **Case 1**: `x = 6`, `y = 3`
   - Expected output: `4`
   - Calculation: `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (incorrect)

2. **Case 2**: `x = 8`, `y = 5`
   - Expected output: `3`
   - Calculation: `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (incorrect)

3. **Case 3**: `x = 22`, `y = 4`
   - Expected output: `6`
   - Calculation: `(22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 18 // 2 + 0 = 9 + 0 = 9` (incorrect)

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to adjust the triangle's sides as per the problem description. For each of the test cases, the outputs do not match the expected results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to accurately compute the number of operations needed, as evidenced by the discrepancies in the test cases. For example, when `x = 6` and `y = 3`, it should return `4`, but it returns `2`.
