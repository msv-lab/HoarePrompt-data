To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD). If such a sequence cannot be formed, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints `-1` since it's impossible to form a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers that sums to `n`.
3. **Sequence Generation**: It attempts to create a sequence:
   - It initializes an empty list `seq`.
   - In a loop from `1` to `k`, it appends the current index `i` to `seq` if `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, and reduces `n` by `i`.
   - If it can append `k` numbers, it prints them; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Issues to Consider
- The program does not account for the requirement that the GCD of the sequence needs to be maximal. It simply generates the first `k` numbers starting from `1`, which may not yield the maximum GCD.
- For example, if `n = 8` and `k = 2`, the program would generate `1` and `2`, resulting in a sum of `3`. However, a better sequence would be `2` and `6`, which has a GCD of `2`.
- The logic fails to ensure that the sum of the sequence equals `n` while maximizing the GCD.

### Counterexample
- **Example Input**:
  ```
  8 2
  ```
  - **Expected Output**: A valid sequence could be `2 6` which sums to `8` and has a GCD of `2`.
  - **Actual Output**: The program would output `1 2`, which sums to `3` and does not meet the requirement.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the requirements of forming a sequence that maximizes the GCD and also meets the sum. 

Thus, the correctness of the program can be concluded as:
Correctness: **False**
