To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximal. If such a sequence cannot be constructed, the program should output `-1`.

### Code Review:

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: 
   The program calculates the minimum sum required to form a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers, which is given by the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct because the smallest k positive integers are `1, 2, ..., k`.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   The program checks if `min_sum` is greater than `n`. If it is, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to form the sequence.

3. **Determining the GCD**:
   The program computes a base integer `d` that can be multiplied with the sequence of integers to create a sum that is close to `n`. It uses the formula `d = n // min_sum`, which is also correct for scaling the sequence.

4. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   The sequence is created using a list comprehension that generates the first `k` integers multiplied by `d`. The program then attempts to distribute any remaining value (`remainder`) across the last elements of the sequence to ensure the sum equals `n`.

5. **Output**:
   The output is printed in the required format.

### Edge Cases:

1. **Case where `n < min_sum`**:
   The program handles this correctly by returning `-1`.

2. **Case where `n = min_sum`**:
   In this case, the output should be the sequence `1, 2, ..., k` multiplied by `d = 1`. This is handled correctly.

3. **Case where `n` is not perfectly divisible by `min_sum`**:
   The program attempts to distribute the `remainder` across the sequence. However, there is a potential issue: if `n` is significantly larger than `min_sum`, the distribution of the `remainder` may not always yield a strictly increasing sequence. 

### Potential Counterexample:
Consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 3`. The minimum sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. 
- Here, `d` would be `10 // 6 = 1`, and the sequence would initially be `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The `remainder` would be `10 - 6 = 4`. The program would then try to increment the last elements of the sequence:
  - It could increment `3` to `4` (1 decrement from `remainder`), leaving `3` as remainder.
  - Next, it could increment `4` to `5` (2 decrements from `remainder`), leaving `1` as remainder.
  - Lastly, it could increment `5` to `6` (which would exceed the strictly increasing condition as it would need to be `7`).

Thus, the program may fail to maintain the strictly increasing condition for certain values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described and can return an incorrect sequence.

Correctness: **False**
