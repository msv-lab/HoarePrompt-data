To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
1. We need to construct a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
3. If such a sequence cannot be formed, we should return -1.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(n, k)` attempts to determine if a valid sequence can be formed based on the following logic:
- It first calculates the minimum possible sum for the first `k` natural numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1 immediately, indicating that it's impossible to form such a sequence.
- The variable `d` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. This represents the maximum GCD we can apply to the sequence.
- The `sequence` is initialized as the first `k` multiples of `d`.
- The remaining sum (`remainder`) is then distributed across the elements of the sequence to ensure that they remain strictly increasing.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum Values**: For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be `[1]` since it's the only possibility. The program handles this correctly.
2. **Impossible Case**: Consider `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The minimum sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is greater than `5`, so the expected output is `-1`. The program correctly returns `-1` in this case.
3. **Multiple Valid Outputs**: The program should be able to generate multiple valid sequences as long as they satisfy the conditions. For instance, for `n = 8` and `k = 2`, the outputs could either be `2 6` or `3 5`, etc. The program generates `2 6` correctly.
4. **Large Values**: The function should be tested with large values of `n` and `k` to ensure it handles calculations without overflow or errors. For example, `n = 10^10` and `k = 10^10` should also return `-1` since the minimum sum would be far greater than `10^10`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the strictly increasing sequence given the constraints. It checks for impossible configurations and adjusts the sequence based on the calculated GCD. 

After evaluating potential edge cases, I did not identify any input where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
