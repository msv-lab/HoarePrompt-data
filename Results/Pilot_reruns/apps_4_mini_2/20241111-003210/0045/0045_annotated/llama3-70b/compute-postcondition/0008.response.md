The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. The parameter `a` represents the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two positive integers `n` and `k`, while `b` is the positive integer `k`. The function returns the value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two parameters where `a` is the GCD of `n` and `k`, and `b` is `k`, and it returns the GCD `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a (the GCD of n and k) and b (k), and returns the GCD a.**
