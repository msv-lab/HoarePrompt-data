The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The loop continues as long as `b` is not zero, swapping `a` and `b` such that `a` becomes the previous value of `b`, and `b` becomes the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. If `b` is initially zero, the loop does not execute, and the function simply returns the initial value of `a`. The final return value is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. 

Key edge cases include:
- If both `a` and `b` are zero, the function will return 0.
- If either `a` or `b` is zero, it will return the non-zero value, since the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If both parameters are zero, it returns 0. If one of the parameters is zero, it returns the other parameter. **
