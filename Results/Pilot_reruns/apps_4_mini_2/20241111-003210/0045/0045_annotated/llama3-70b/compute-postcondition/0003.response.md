According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue executing as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is equal to `k % (n % k)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero.

Since `b` is derived from the expression `k % (n % k)`, for `b` to be non-zero, `k` must not be a multiple of `n % k`. Therefore, `k` should be such that `k` is not equal to 0 (to avoid division by zero) and `n % k` must not equal `k`.

Given the current state where `b` is defined as `k % (n % k)`, we need to ensure that this expression evaluates to a non-zero value. No other states need to be adjusted, as `a` does not influence `b`.

State: **`a` is `n % k`, `b` is not equal to 0**
