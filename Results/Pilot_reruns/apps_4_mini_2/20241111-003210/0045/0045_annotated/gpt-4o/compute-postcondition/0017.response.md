Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is at least 3; `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2; `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum; `sequence[i]` (where `i` is `k - 3`) is incremented by 1; `remainder` is decremented by 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
