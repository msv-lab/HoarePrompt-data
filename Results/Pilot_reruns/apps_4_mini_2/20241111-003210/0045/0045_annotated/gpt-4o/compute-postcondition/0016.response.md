To determine the necessary adjustments to the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop iterates from `i = k - 1` down to `i = 0`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2` (since `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 where `i` is `k - 2`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `k - 3`.

3. The loop condition depends solely on `k`. Since `i` starts at `k - 1`, the loop can only iterate as long as `i` is non-negative. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3 (so that `k - 3` is non-negative).

4. Based on the information provided, `k` is currently a positive integer, and we need to ensure that it remains valid for the next iteration.

5. The other values in the state (`n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence[i]`, and `remainder`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Now, let's summarize the adjustments needed:

- We need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 3 to allow one more iteration of the loop, which means `k` must be adjusted to at least 3.
- The value of `i` should be updated to `k - 3`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is at least 3, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `sequence[i]` (where `i` is `k - 3`) is incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decremented by 1.**
