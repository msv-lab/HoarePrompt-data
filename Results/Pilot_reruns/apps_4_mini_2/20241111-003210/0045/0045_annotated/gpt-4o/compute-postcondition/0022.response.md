Output State: **`sequence` is a list containing the elements `[d + x_1, 2d + x_2, 3d + x_3, ..., kd + x_k]` where `x_i` represents the number of increments for each element that occurred during the loop execution; `remainder` is the number of remaining decrements after the loop; if `remainder` is initially 0, then the loop does not execute, and `sequence` remains `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `sequence` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than `min_sum`, then `d` is 0, and `sequence` remains as `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` without any modifications from the loop.**
