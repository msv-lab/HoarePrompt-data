To calculate the output state, we first look at the variables and the operations defined in the initial state. 

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{10}\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{10}\).
   - `min_sum` is calculated as \(k * (k + 1) // 2\).
   - `d` is assigned the value \(n // min_sum\).

2. **Operation**:
   - The line of code provided is:
     ```
     remainder = n - d * min_sum
     ```
   - This operation computes the `remainder` by subtracting the product of `d` and `min_sum` from `n`.

3. **Impact**:
   - The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of \(n - (n // min_sum) * min_sum\).
   - This calculation gives the remainder when `n` is divided by `min_sum`.

Since `n`, `k`, and consequently `min_sum` and `d` are not specified with exact values in the initial state, the output state will describe the relationship and calculation without numerical results.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`; `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`; `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.**
