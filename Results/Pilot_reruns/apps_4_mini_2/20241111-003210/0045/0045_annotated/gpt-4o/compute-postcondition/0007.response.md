The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`, `i` is `k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
