According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the range defined in the loop. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is currently `k - 3` (since `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1).
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

To determine the state for the next iteration:
- After the last iteration, `i` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will now be `k - 4`.
- The loop can still execute as long as `i` is still in the defined range (i.e., `0` to `k - 1`).

Since `k` is at least 3, `k - 4` will be valid if `k` is at least 4. If `k` is exactly 3, `i` would be `-1`, which would mean the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure:
- `k` is at least 4 (which would make `i` equal to `k - 4` valid).

Other states do not need to be adjusted based on the provided loop structure.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is at least 4; `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2; `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum; `sequence[i]` (where `i` is `k - 4`) is incremented by 1; `remainder` is decremented by 1, and if `remainder` was previously 1, the loop is exited; otherwise, it continues.**
