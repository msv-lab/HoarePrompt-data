The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` integers (1 through `k`), denoted as `min_sum`. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it constructs a sequence of `k` integers such that the sum of these integers equals `n`. The sequence is formed by distributing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum` across the integers, and if there are remaining units after this distribution, they are added incrementally to the last elements of the sequence. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence. Edge cases include handling when `n` is less than `min_sum`, which leads to an immediate return of -1, and scenarios where `n` can be perfectly divided by `min_sum` with no remainder.
