The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, with `a` representing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two initial values `n` and `k`, and `b` being a variable that can change during execution. If `b` is greater than 0, the function modifies `a` to be the GCD of the initial values of `n` and `k`, and sets `b` to 0; in this case, the function will return the modified value of `a`. If `b` is initially 0, `a` retains its initial value, which is either `n` or `k`, and the function returns this value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the GCD of `n` and `k` if `b` is greater than 0, or return the initial value of `a` if `b` is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, returns the GCD of `n` and `k` if `b` is greater than 0; if `b` is 0, it returns the initial value of `a`.**
