Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the value determined at the start of the loop, `sequence` contains the first `k` multiples of `d` with potentially the last few elements incremented depending on the initial value of remainder, and the function returns `sequence`.**
