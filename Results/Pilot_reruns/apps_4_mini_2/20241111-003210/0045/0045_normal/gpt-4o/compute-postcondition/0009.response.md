Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `remainder = n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the first `k` multiples of `d`, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
