Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that it is not possible to reach the minimum sum with the given `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, implying that the condition for returning -1 was not met.***
