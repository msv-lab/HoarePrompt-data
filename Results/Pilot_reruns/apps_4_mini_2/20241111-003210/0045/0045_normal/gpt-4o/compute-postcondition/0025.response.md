Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and checks if the sum of the first `k` positive integers is greater than `n`. If it is, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence of `k` numbers where each number is a multiple of `d` (which is the integer division of `n` by the minimum sum), and distributes any remaining value from `n` into the sequence until the remainder is exhausted. The function ultimately returns this sequence of `k` integers, ensuring that they form a valid distribution that sums up to `n`. **
