Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is one less than its previous value, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. If `remainder` equals 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the conditions for continuing the loop have not been met.***
