Output State: **If remainder is greater than 0 and k is at least 1, then sequence will have been incremented at least once, with the last element being increased, and remainder will be decremented accordingly. If remainder is 0 at the start of the loop, then sequence remains unchanged, and the loop does not execute. After the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the value determined at the start of the loop, `sequence` contains the first `k` multiples of `d` with potentially the last few elements incremented depending on the initial value of remainder.**
