The code `sequence[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the `sequence` list by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`) remain unaffected by this operation. The impact of the code specifically alters the value of `sequence[i]`, but without knowing the previous value of `sequence[i]`, we cannot determine its exact new value. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the `sequence` list and indicates that the specific index `i` has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
