The function returns `-1`, and the values of `n` and `k` are positive integers, while `min_sum` is calculated as the sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The return statement does not change the state of `n`, `k`, or `min_sum`, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and the function returns -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and the function returns -1**
