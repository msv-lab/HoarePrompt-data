Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `remainder = n - d * min_sum`. The `sequence` is a list containing the first `k` multiples of `d`, and `i` is `k - 1`. If `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `remainder` is not zero, the loop continues to execute without breaking.***
