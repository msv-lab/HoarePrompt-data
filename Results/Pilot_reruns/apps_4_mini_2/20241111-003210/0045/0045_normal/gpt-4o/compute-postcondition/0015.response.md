The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `remainder` was calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. Therefore, after the execution, `remainder` will be one less than its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is one less than its previous value, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
