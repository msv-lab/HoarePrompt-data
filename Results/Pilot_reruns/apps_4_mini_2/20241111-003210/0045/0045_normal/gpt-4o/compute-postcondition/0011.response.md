According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. 

Given that `i` starts at `k - 1`, after one iteration it will be `k - 2`. The loop can still execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to `k - 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`) remain unaffected by the loop structure.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `remainder = n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the first `k` multiples of `d`, `i` is `k - 2`, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decremented by 1.**
