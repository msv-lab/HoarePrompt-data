The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers. 

In Case 1, if the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers (denoted as `min_sum`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that it is not possible to reach the minimum sum with the given `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, implying that the condition for returning -1 was not met.

In Case 2, if the conditions are satisfied (i.e., `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`), the function computes a sequence of the first `k` multiples of a calculated value based on `n` and `min_sum`, and the function returns this `sequence`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers, `n` and `k`, and return -1 if the minimum sum of the first `k` integers is greater than `n`. If the minimum sum is not greater than `n`, the function returns a sequence of the first `k` multiples based on the calculated values from `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, and returns -1 if the sum of the first k positive integers exceeds n. If this condition is not met, it returns a sequence of the first k multiples based on the values of n and k.**
