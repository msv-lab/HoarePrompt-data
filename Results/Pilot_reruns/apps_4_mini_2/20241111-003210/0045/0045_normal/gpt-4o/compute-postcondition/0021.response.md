According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which starts at `k - 1` and decrements down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been decremented by 1. 

Given the provided state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is greater than or equal to 2
- `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers
- `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`
- `remainder` has been decremented by 1
- `sequence[i]` has been incremented by 1

Since `i` starts at `k - 1`, after the last iteration, `i` would now be `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `k - 1` again. 

Therefore:
- `i` must be adjusted back to `k - 1`.
- No other states need to be adjusted since `k` has not changed and the other variables do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`**
