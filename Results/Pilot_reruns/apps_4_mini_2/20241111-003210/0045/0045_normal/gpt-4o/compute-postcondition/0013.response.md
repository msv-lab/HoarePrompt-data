Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing the first `k` multiples of `d`. If the `remainder` is equal to 0, the inner loop is exited, indicating that the sequence has been fully distributed without any remaining value.***
