To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the code carefully, along with the output hints.

### Problem Description Review
The problem requires comparing two very large non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, which may contain leading zeroes. The output should indicate whether `a < b`, `a > b`, or `a = b`. The specifications also mention that we should read the input efficiently since the input size can be very large.

### Code Analysis
The provided code reads the input in one go, splits the input into two parts, and removes leading zeroes from both numbers. It then checks the lengths of the two numbers after removing leading zeroes, and compares them. If their lengths are equal, it further compares the values of the two numbers.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the code:
1. It uses `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once, which is efficient for large inputs.
2. It splits the input into two strings, `a` and `b`.
3. Leading zeroes are stripped from both numbers. If the stripping leads to an empty string, it is replaced with `'0'`.
4. The lengths of both strings are compared to determine which number is larger.
5. If the lengths are equal, it compares the two strings lexicographically.
6. Finally, it prints the appropriate symbol based on the comparison.

### Edge Case Considerations
- Both numbers could be zero, which is handled correctly by the code.
- Leading zeroes are removed, ensuring comparisons are accurate.
- Input consisting solely of zeroes like `0000` and `0000` would yield an '=' output, which is handled correctly.
- The code also handles cases like `0123` and `9` correctly, outputting `>`.

### Output Hints Review
The output hints state that the function handles comparisons accurately, including edge cases such as both inputs being '0', or either input being empty. This aligns with the logic implemented in the code.

### Conclusion
After thoroughly reviewing the problem description, the code, and the output hints, it seems that the code correctly implements the required functionality for all described cases and edge cases. There are no apparent flaws or missed edge cases in the logic.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True**.
