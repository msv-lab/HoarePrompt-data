Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeroes removed, and it is unchanged unless it is an empty string, in which case it is set to '0'. `b` is '0' if it was initially an empty string; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; otherwise, the output is '='. This accounts for cases where both `a` and `b` are equal, and also handles the scenario where either `a` or `b` may be '0'.***
