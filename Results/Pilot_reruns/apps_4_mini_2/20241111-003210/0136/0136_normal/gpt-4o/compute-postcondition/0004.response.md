Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeroes removed, and `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed. If `a` is an empty string (which means it had no digits), it is set to '0'. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `data` is a list containing the input strings.***
