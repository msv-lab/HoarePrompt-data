Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and compares them. It removes any leading zeroes and handles cases where either input could be empty by treating it as '0'. It then determines the relationship between the two numbers and prints '<', '>', or '=' based on their comparison. This includes edge cases where both inputs are '0', or either input is empty, ensuring accurate comparisons regardless of leading zeroes or input length. **
