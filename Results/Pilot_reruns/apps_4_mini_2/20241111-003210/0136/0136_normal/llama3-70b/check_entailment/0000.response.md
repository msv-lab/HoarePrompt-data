To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will first analyze the code in relation to the specification and then consider the output hints to identify any discrepancies.

**Program Analysis:**
The given program reads two long integers `a` and `b` from input, strips any leading zeros, and then compares them lexicographically. The output is determined based on the comparison:
- It prints '=' if `a` and `b` are equal.
- It prints '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`.
- It prints '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. Both numbers are zero: `0` and `0` should correctly return '='.
2. Leading zeros: The program handles leading zeros correctly by using `lstrip('0')`.
3. Different lengths: The lexicographic comparison works correctly for strings of different lengths, as a shorter string with leading zeros should be equivalent to its non-zero counterpart.
4. All zeros: The program needs to handle cases where both numbers become empty strings after stripping zeros (e.g., `0000` and `0000`).

The program seems to cover these cases adequately. However, one potential edge case is when both inputs are entirely zeros, which will result in empty strings after stripping leading zeros. The comparison of two empty strings should return '=', which the current code does not explicitly handle.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints indicate that the function compares the stripped strings correctly and prints the appropriate symbols based on the comparison. They also affirm that the program does not return any values and only prints the result.

Upon verifying the output hints, it is clear that they agree with the code logic in most cases. However, they do not explicitly handle all edge cases, particularly the scenario where both inputs are entirely zeros.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not explicitly handle the case when both inputs are zero, which can result in incorrect behavior. Since it is possible for the program to produce incorrect output in at least one case, I conclude that the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program will fail when both inputs are '0', as it will compare two empty strings instead, which is not the correct representation of equality in this context.
