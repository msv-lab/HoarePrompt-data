The code executes a print statement that outputs the string `<`. The values of variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the variable values, and we note that the output of the print statement occurs.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, and the function prints `<`**
