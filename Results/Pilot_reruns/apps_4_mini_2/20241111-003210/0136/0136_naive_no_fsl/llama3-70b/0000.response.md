Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle the case when both input numbers are "0". According to the problem description, when both a and b are equal, the output should be "=". However, if the input numbers are "0" (with or without leading zeros), the program would strip the leading zeros and compare the empty strings, resulting in an incorrect output.

For example:
Input
```
0
0
```
Expected Output: `=`
Actual Output: The program would compare two empty strings after stripping the leading zeros, leading to an undefined behavior since the comparison would be between `''` and `''`, which would yield `=` incorrectly.

Thus, the program does not handle this edge case correctly.
