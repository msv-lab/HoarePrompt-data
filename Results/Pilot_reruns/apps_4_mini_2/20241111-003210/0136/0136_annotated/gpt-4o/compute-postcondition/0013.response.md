Postcondition: ***`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, or '0' if empty; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes, and if `b` is initially empty, it is set to '0'. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If both strings are equal, the output is '='. This includes all edge cases where both `a` and `b` could be empty, leading to both being '0', and scenarios where either string can be longer or contain different characters while ensuring proper lexicographical comparison.***
