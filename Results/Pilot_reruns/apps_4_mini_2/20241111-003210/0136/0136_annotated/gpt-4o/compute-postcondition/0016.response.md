The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing up to \(10^6\) digits, and may include leading zeroes. The functionality of the function is to perform operations on these string-represented integers and return a result based on those operations. However, the specific operations and return values are not provided in the output description. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, both represented as strings, and performs operations on them.**
