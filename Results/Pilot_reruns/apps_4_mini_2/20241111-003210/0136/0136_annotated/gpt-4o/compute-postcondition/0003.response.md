The value of `a` is assigned the string '0'. The previous state of `a` was a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, but the new assignment overrides that value. The value of `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0', `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes**
