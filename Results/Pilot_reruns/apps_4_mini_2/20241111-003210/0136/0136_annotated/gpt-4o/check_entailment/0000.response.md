Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses `input().split()` to read the input, which assumes the input is on a single line. However, the problem description specifies that the first line should contain the first number `a` and the second line should contain the second number `b`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect readings of the integers.

Additionally, the annotations indicate that if either `a` or `b` is empty after stripping leading zeroes, it is set to '0'. This logic is sound for handling leading zeroes, but it is irrelevant if the input is read incorrectly in the first place. 

For example, if the input is:
```
00012345
12345
```
The expected output should be `=`. However, if the input is read incorrectly due to the `input().split()` method, the program may not process these lines properly, potentially leading to incorrect comparisons.

Furthermore, the program does not account for the case when both inputs are empty (e.g., if two lines of input are completely empty). It should treat both as '0', but the initial reading method could lead to unexpected behavior.

Thus, the failure to read the input correctly according to the problem description and potential mishandling of empty input strings leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

In summary, the primary issue is the incorrect input reading mechanism, which does not align with the problem statement, resulting in the program not functioning as required for all cases.
