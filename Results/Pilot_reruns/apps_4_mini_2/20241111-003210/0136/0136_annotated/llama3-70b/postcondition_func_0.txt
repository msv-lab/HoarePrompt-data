The function accepts two non-negative integer strings, reads them from input after stripping leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first is less than the second, and '>' if the first is greater than the second. The function does not handle cases where the input strings may be empty, which could lead to unexpected comparisons. If both inputs are empty, the function will treat them as equal and print '='.
