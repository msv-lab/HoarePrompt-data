The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is within the specified range, `r` is within the specified range, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
