Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is defined, `s` has at least `n` elements, and `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[i]` if `shares` is greater than 0, in which case `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while ensuring that `r` remains greater than or equal to `s[0]`.***
