The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns `s` a list of integers obtained from user input, where the input is split into separate values and each value is converted to an integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges; `s` is a list of integers created from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are integers within the specified ranges; `s` is a list of integers created from the input**
