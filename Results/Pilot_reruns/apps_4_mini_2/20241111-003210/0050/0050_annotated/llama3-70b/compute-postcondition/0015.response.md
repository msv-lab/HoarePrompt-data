Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is within the specified range, `r` is updated to `r % s[0]` if `r < s[1]`, otherwise `r` is updated to `r % s[1]`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, `shares` remains 0, and execution breaks out of the loop. `s`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, with `i` still equal to 1.***
