The code snippet `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in place in descending order. This operation directly affects the variable `b`, but does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, or `s`. The state of `b` will now reflect the sorted order.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are integers within the specified ranges; `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**.
