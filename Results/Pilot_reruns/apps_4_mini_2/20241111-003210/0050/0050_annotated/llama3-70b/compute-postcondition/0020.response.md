Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is within the specified range, and `r` is updated to `r % s[1]`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[1]` and then updated to `r % s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, `shares` remains 0 and execution breaks out of the loop. Accessing `s[2]` may lead to an error, and care should be taken to ensure that `s` has the appropriate size to avoid this issue.***
