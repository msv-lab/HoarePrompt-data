Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is within the specified range, `r` is updated to `r % s[0]` and `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[0]` (i.e., `shares` becomes `0 + (r // s[0])`), if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, the loop is exited, and the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` remain unchanged with `shares` still equal to 0 and `i` equal to 0.***
