Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is defined, `s` has at least `n` elements, and `i` is the current index (i). If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
