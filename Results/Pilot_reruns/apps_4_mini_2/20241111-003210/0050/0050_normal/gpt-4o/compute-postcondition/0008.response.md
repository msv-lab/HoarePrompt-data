The variable `total_bourles` is calculated by multiplying `max_shares` with `max_sell_price` and then adding `remaining_bourles`. The values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` are determined by the initial state. 

- `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`.
- `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.

Thus, `total_bourles` is assigned the value of `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers; `s` is a list of `n` integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_shares` is calculated as r // min_buy_price; `remaining_bourles` is r % min_buy_price; `total_bourles` is calculated as max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles.**
