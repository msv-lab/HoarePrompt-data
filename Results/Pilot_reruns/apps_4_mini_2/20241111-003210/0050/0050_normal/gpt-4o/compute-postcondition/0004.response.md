The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`, which represents the selling prices of shares. The state of other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`) is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables alongside the newly calculated value.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers assigned from input values; `s` is a list of `n` integers representing buying prices of shares; `b` is a list of integers representing selling prices of shares; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.**
