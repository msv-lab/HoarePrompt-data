Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and two lists `s` and `b` representing buying and selling prices of shares, respectively. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be purchased with `r` using the minimum buying price and computes the total bourles gained by selling those shares at the maximum selling price, plus any remaining bourles. The function then prints the total bourles. This function does not handle cases where the input lists `s` or `b` are empty, which could lead to errors when calculating minimum and maximum values.**
