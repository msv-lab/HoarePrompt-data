The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b`. Here are the specifics:

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 30.
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `s_i` (1 ≤ s_i ≤ 1000) represents the buying price of shares.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_i` (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 1000) represents the selling price of shares.

After executing the function body, the function will return a specific value based on the logic defined within. However, since the output behavior is not specified in the provided information, we will summarize what we know about the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, a list `s` of buying prices, and a list `b` of selling prices, with defined constraints on their values.**
