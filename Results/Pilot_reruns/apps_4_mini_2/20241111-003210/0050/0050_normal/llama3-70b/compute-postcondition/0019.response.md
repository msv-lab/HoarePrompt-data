The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 1 and 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
