According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increase by 1. 

Since `i` is currently 1, to allow another iteration, `i` should be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted as `n` being at least 2 is sufficient for the loop to run again with `i` now being 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 1 and 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 2**
