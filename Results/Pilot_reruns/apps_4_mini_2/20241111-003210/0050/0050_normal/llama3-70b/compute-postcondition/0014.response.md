Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 1 and 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is increased by `r // s[0]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[0]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
