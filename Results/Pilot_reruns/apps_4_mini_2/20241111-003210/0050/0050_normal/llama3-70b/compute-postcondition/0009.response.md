The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 1 and 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is initialized to 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
