Output State: **`numerator` is the product of the first `k` terms of the form `(2^n - i) % 1000003` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`, `denominator` is `(2^n)^k % 1000003`, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `k` is at least 2. If `k` is less than 1, the loop won't execute and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1. If `k` is greater than `total_days`, the loop will execute `k` times but the `numerator` will be updated with terms that may become negative or zero, affecting the final output.**
