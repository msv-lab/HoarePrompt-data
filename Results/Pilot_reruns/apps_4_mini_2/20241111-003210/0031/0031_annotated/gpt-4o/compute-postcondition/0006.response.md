The variable `denominator` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is \(2^n\), and `numerator` is 1. The assignment does not change any other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
