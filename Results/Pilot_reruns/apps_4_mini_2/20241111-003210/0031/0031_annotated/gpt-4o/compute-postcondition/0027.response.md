The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `n` satisfies the constraint of being between 1 and 10^18, and `k` satisfies the constraint of being between 2 and 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function does not print anything and continues execution beyond this point. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, and to either print (1, 1) and return if `k` exceeds 2 raised to the power of `n`, or to continue execution silently if `k` is within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) and returns if `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`; otherwise, it continues execution without printing anything.**
