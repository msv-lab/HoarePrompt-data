The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2` raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the value of `total_days` will be \(2^n\). The other variables, `k` and `MOD`, are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and `total_days` is \(2^n\)**.
