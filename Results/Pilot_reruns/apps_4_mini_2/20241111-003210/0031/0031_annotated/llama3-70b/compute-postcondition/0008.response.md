The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is `2` raised to the power of `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\). Therefore, after executing the line, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days`, which is `denominator * (2 ** n)`. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `total_days` is 2 ** `n`, `numerator` is `total_days * (2`, and `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2 ** n)`**.
