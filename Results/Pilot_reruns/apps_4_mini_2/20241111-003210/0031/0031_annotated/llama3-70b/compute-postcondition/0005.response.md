The `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. The initial value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is `2 ** n`. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes `1 * (2 ** n)`, which is `2 ** n`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `total_days` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is `total_days`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
