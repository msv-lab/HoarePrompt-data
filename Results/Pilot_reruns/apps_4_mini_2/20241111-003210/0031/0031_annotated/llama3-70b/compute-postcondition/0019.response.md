Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It calculates `total_days` as \(2^n\), and then computes the product of the last `k` days from `total_days` for both the numerator and denominator. The function then simplifies the fraction formed by the numerator and denominator by dividing both by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Finally, it returns the numerator and denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If `k` is greater than or equal to `total_days`, the numerator will end up as zero, leading to a return value of `(0, denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3))`.**
