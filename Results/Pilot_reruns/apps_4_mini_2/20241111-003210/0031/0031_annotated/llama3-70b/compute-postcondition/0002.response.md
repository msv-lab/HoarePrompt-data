The variable `denominator` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered, and the values of `n`, `k`, `total_days`, and `numerator` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `denominator` is now `1`, while the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1**
