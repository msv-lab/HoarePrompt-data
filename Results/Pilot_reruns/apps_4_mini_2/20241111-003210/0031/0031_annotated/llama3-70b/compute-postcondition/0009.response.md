According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `k` remains at least 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `total_days` is 2**
