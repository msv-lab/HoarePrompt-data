`total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, which means `total_days` will be 2 raised to the power of `n`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, the value of `total_days` will be a large integer. The state of the variable `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
