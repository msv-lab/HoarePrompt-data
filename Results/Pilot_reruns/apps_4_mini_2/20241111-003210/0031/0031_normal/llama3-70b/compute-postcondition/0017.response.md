The function returns two values: `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`. The values of `numerator` and `denominator` are not explicitly provided, but `denominator` has been updated to `denominator // gcd`. The modulo operation will affect the final output, but without specific values for `numerator` and `denominator`, we can't determine the exact results of the modulo operations.

Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that the function returns two computed values based on the current state of `numerator` and `denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is now `denominator // gcd`, and the function returns `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`**
