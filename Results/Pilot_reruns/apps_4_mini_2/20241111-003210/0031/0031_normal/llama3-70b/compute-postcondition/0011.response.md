The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it by `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is \(2^n \times total_days\), and since `total_days` is \(2^n\), we can express the new value as follows:

- New `denominator` = Previous `denominator` \(\times\) `total_days`
- New `denominator` = \((2^n \times total_days) \times total_days\) = \(2^n \times (total_days)^2\)

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `total_days`, `numerator`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18; `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18; `total_days` is \(2^n\); `numerator` is updated to \((2^n \times (2^n - 1)) \times (2^n - 2); `denominator` is \(2^n \times (total_days)^2\); `i` is 2**
