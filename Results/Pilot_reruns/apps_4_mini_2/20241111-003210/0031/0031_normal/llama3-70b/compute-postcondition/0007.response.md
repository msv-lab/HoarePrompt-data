The code assigns the value of `numerator` after multiplying it by `total_days - i`. The previous values are as follows: `total_days` is \(2^n\) and `i` is 1. Therefore, the calculation for `total_days - i` becomes \(2^n - 1\). 

Now, we can calculate the new value of `numerator`:
- `numerator` is initially \(2^n\).
- After the operation, it will be \(numerator *= (2^n - 1)\).

Thus, the new value of `numerator` will be \(2^n \times (2^n - 1)\). The other variables (`k`, `total_days`, `denominator`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 1), `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is 1**
