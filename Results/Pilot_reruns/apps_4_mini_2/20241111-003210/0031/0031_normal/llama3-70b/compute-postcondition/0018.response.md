The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function, it divides `numerator` by `gcd`, updates `denominator` by dividing it by `gcd`, and then returns the result of `numerator % (10`. 

However, the output description appears to be incomplete. Based on the provided information, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, n and k, and returns the result of `numerator % (10`, after performing specific operations involving `gcd`.**
