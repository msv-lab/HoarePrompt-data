The value of `p_shared` is calculated using the formula `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. Given that `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator` and `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, we can express `p_shared` in terms of these variables. The calculation involves subtracting `numerator` from `denominator`, adding `MOD`, and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `p_no_shared` and `p_total` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state reflects the calculations and the assignments made. 

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD**
