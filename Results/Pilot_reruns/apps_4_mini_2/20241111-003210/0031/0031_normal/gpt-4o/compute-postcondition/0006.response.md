The variable `denominator` is assigned the value 1. The other variables, `n`, `total_days`, and `numerator`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is \(2^n\); `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is \(2^n\); `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1**
