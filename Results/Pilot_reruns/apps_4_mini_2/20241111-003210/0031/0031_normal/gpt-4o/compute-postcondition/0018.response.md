Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, which is determined based on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, then `numerator` is the product of \(2^n - i\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(k-1\) multiplied by \(2^n \mod MOD\); if `k` is less than 1, then `numerator` is 1.**
