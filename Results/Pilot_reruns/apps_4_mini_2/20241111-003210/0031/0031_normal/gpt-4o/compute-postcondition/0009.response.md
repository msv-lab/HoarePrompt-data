The `denominator` is assigned the value of `denominator * total_days % MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is \(2^n\). Therefore, the new value of `denominator` will be calculated as:

\[
\text{denominator} = 1 * (2^n) \mod MOD
\]

Thus, the new value of `denominator` will be \(2^n \mod MOD\).

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n \mod MOD\), `denominator` is \(2^n \mod MOD\), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
