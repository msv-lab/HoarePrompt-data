Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, and first checks if `k` is greater than \(2^n\). If it is, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), it computes two values based on combinatorial calculations and prints the results after applying a modulus operation. However, if `k` is 0 or negative, additional handling for those cases is not defined, as the function does not explicitly handle those situations, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
