Initial State: `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD; `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; and `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`.

```
A //= g
```

Now, `A` is divided by `g`. The value of `A` before this operation is `p_shared`, and `g` is the result of `func_1(A, B)`. After performing the operation `A //= g`, `A` is updated to the integer division of its previous value by `g`. The values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, `B`, and `g` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`**.
