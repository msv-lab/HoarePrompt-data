The value of `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The initial state does not provide the value of `denominator`, so we cannot determine its specific value. However, we note that the state of `p_no_shared` is unchanged by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged value of `p_no_shared` and the assignment of `p_total` to `denominator`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`**.
