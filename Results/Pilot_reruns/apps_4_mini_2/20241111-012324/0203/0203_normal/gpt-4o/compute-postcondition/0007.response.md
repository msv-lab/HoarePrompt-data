Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string of length `n`; `i` is 0; `v` is the first character of `votes`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains 0 and `r_queue` is empty. If `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` is empty and `r_queue` contains 0.***
