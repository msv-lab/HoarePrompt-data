The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes the input string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is only involved in the previous assignment. The previous value of `votes` is not defined until input is provided, but it will be a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential change to `votes` but leaves `n` as it is.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R'**
