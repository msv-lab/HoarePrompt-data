Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is not empty and `r_queue` is empty. If `d_index` (the first element removed from `d_queue`) is less than `r_index` (an error due to `r_queue` being empty), then `d_queue` is updated to include `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` remains unchanged but still holds an error state since it cannot pop an element.***
