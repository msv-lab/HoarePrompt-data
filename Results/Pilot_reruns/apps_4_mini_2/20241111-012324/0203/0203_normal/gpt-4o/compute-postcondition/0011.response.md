Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string of length `n`; `i` is 1; and `v` is the second character of `votes`. If the second character `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` is updated to include the value 1. If `v` is not 'D' (which implies it could be any character other than 'D'), then `r_queue` is updated to include the value 1.***
