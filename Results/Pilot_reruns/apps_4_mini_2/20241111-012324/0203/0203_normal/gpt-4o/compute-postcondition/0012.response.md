To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step. 

1. The loop is set to iterate over `votes` using `enumerate`, which means it will continue until all characters in the string `votes` have been processed.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, which indicates that the loop has processed the first character of `votes` (index 0).
3. The next character to be processed in the next iteration will be at index 2 (`i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration).
4. The value of `n` is given to be between 1 and 200,000, which tells us that `votes` has at least 2 characters since `i` is currently 1.
5. Since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n`, which implies that `n` should be greater than 2.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` needs to be updated to 2, reflecting the next index.
- `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue iterating.

Thus, the new state will be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than 2; `votes` is an input string of length `n`; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`**
