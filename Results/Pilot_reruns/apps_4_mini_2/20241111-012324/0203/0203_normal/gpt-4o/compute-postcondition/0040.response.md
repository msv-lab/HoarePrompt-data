The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. The function processes these inputs and returns the result based on specific conditions. 

However, since the output cases are not provided, we will summarize the parameters and their characteristics. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string votes of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
