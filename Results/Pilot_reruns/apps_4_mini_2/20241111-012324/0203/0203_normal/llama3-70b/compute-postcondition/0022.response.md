Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If the count of 'D' is greater than the count of 'R', it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If `n` is 0 or the `fractions` string is empty, it defaults to printing 'R' since no characters would be counted. There is no error handling for invalid input, such as non-integer values for `n` or characters other than 'D' and 'R' in `fractions`.**
