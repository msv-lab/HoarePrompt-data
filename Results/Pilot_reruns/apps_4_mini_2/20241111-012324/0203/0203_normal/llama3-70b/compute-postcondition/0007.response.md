Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented to 1 and `remocrats` remains 0; if `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented to 1 and `depublicans` remains 0.***
