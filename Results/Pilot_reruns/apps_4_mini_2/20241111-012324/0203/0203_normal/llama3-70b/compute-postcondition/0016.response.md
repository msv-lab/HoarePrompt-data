According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. The loop can execute again as long as there are more characters in the string. Since `n` is the length of `fractions`, at the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is the third character, which means the loop has processed the first two characters.

For the loop to execute one more time, `fraction` needs to be updated to the next character in the string, which would be the fourth character. Additionally, since the loop is iterating through `fractions`, it's important to note that `n` remains the same because it represents the total number of characters in the string.

Thus, the updated states would be:
- `fraction` should be the fourth character of `fractions`.
- The index for the loop iteration should be adjusted to reflect that the next character is being processed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the fourth character of `fractions`**
