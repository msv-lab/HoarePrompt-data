The code executes the `print('R')` statement, which outputs the character 'R'. The values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain unchanged at 0, as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, and 'R' is printed**
