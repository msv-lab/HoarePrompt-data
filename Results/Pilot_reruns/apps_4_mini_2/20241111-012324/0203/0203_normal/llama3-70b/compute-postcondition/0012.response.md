According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `fractions`. The loop will continue as long as there are more characters to process in the string. At the end of the last iteration, we have `n`, which is the length of the string `fractions`, and `fraction`, which is the second character of `fractions`. 

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and since the loop processes each character in the string, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (indicating that there is a third character). 

Since the loop processes characters one by one and `fraction` is currently the second character, the next character that will be processed in the next iteration will be the third character. Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is a third character available in the string.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the third character of `fractions`.**
