The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is 0, so after execution, `remocrats` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
