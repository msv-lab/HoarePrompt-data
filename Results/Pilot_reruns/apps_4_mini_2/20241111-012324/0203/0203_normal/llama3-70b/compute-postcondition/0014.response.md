The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `fraction`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the third character of `fractions`; `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the third character of `fractions`; `remocrats` is increased by 1**
