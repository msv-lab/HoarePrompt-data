Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the function prints 'D'. If `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the function prints 'R'. If `n` is 0 or `fractions` is an empty string, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and 'R' is printed.***
