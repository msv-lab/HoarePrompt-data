According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. For the loop to execute, the string `fractions` must contain at least one character, which is guaranteed since `n` is a positive integer. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `fraction` will represent the current character in the `fractions` string. The index of the loop iteration is implicit and does not need to be explicitly stated, as it will start from the first character.

Thus, to summarize the initial states before the loop executes:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), ensuring `fractions` is non-empty.
- `fractions` contains the characters 'D' and 'R'.
- `depublicans` and `remocrats` are initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 0; `remocrats` is 0; `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`**
