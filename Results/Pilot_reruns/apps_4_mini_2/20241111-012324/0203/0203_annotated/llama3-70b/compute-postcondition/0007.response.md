Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; if the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` remains 0; if the first character is 'R', then `depublicans` remains 0 and `remocrats` is 1.***
