Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`; and `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1. If `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1.***
