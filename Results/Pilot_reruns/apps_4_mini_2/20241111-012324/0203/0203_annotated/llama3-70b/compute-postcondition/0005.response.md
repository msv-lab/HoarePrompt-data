`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is 0, so after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 1; `remocrats` is 0; `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 1; `remocrats` is 0; `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`**
