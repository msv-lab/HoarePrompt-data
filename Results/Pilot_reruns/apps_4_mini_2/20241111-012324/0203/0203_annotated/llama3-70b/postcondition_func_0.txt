The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` that consists solely of the characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string and prints 'D' if the count of 'D' is greater than that of 'R'. Otherwise, it prints 'R', which also covers the case when both counts are equal. The function does not handle any input validation beyond the assumption that `n` will always be within the specified bounds.
