The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` will also be a valid index in the range of `0` to `199999`. The state of `n`, `votes`, and `v` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of `i` to the `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `v` is the character at index `n - 1` in `votes`, and `i` has been appended to `d_queue`.**
