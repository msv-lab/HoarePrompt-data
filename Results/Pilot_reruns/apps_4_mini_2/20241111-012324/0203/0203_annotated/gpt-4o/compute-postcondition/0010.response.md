The `r_queue.append(i)` statement adds the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The variable `i` has a value of `n - 1`, which is within the range of valid indices for the string `votes`. The state of `n`, `votes`, and `v` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `n - 1`; `v` is the character at index `n - 1` in `votes`, and `i` has been appended to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `n - 1`; `v` is the character at index `n - 1` in `votes`, and `i` has been appended to `r_queue`.**
