The code initializes `d_queue` as an empty list. The variables `n` and `votes` are not affected by this operation, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `votes`, as well as the new state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list**
