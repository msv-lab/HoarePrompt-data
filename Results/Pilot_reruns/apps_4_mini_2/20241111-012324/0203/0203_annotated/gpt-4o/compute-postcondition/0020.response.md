The value of `d_index` is assigned the first element popped from `d_queue`, and `d_queue` becomes one element shorter. The value of `r_index` is assigned the first element popped from `r_queue`, which also reduces `r_queue` by one element. The code appends `d_index + n` to `d_queue`.

Since `d_index` and `n` are not explicitly defined in the task, but they are used in the calculation, we can summarize the output state. The new value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`, and the states of `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`d_queue` includes the new element `d_index + n`, `d_queue` is one element longer, and `r_queue` is one element shorter.**
