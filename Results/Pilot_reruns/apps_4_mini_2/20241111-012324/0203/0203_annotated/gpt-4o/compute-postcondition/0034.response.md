Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` remain as the first elements from `d_queue` and `r_queue` respectively prior to the operation, ensuring both queues are updated based on their respective conditions.***
