Output State: **`d_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now one element shorter; `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `r_queue`, which reduces `r_queue` by one element; `r_queue` now has the value of `r_index + n` appended to it.**
