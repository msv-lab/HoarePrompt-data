The variable `r_queue` is assigned an empty list, and its creation does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**.
