Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all 'R' characters in `votes`. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `n` is at least 1, then the loop executes `n` times, and `i` will range from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.**
