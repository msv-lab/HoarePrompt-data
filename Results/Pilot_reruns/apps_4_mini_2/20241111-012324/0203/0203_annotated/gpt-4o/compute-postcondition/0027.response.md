The variable `r_index` has been assigned the value of the first element of the original `r_queue` and has been removed from it. The code `r_queue.append(r_index + n)` appends the value `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. Since `n` is not specified in the initial state, it retains its value, which is unknown. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty after appending `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue` before being removed.**
