The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. Since `i` is initialized to 0, the value appended to `r_queue` will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains 0, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first character of `votes`.
