To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the statement on the variables involved.

The code snippet provided is:
```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

- The variable `apartment` is referenced in the computation of `block`. Since `a` and `b` represent apartment numbers and are distinct integers between `1` and `n·m·k`, we can assume `apartment` can take the values `a` or `b`.
- The value of `m` and `k` is known to be a positive integer between `1` and `1000`.

The calculation for `block` involves:
1. Subtracting `1` from `apartment` (either `a` or `b`).
2. Dividing the result by the product of `m` and `k`.
3. Taking the floor of the division (integer division) and then adding `1`.

Since we cannot determine the exact values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` without additional information, we can conclude that `block` will be calculated based on the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.

The final output state can thus be summarized as:
- `block` is calculated based on the formula provided.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block` is calculated as per the formula.**
