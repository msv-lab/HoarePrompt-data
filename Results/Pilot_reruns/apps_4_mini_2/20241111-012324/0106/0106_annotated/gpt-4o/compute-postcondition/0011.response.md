The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with constraints that they must each be between 1 and 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that their values must be between 1 and `n * m * k`. After executing the function, it returns `total_time`, which is calculated based on various components including `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the specified parameters and return the total time calculated based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers between 1 and 1000) and distinct integers a, b (between 1 and n·m·k), returning total_time calculated from these parameters.**
