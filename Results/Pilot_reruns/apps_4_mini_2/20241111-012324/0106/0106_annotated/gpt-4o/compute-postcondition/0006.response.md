The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value of `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` influence the calculation, but without specific values for these variables, we can only describe the relationship. 

The variable `abs(block_a - block_b)` calculates the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`. This is then subtracted from `n`, and the result is taken modulo `n`. The final result is multiplied by 15 to determine `reverse_walk_time`.

Since the values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` are not provided, we cannot calculate a specific numerical result.

Output State: **`reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**.
