The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The value of `floor_b` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `time_to_target_floor`. The other variables, such as `reverse_walk_time` and `min_walk_time`, remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `time_to_target_floor` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is (floor_b - 1) * 5**
