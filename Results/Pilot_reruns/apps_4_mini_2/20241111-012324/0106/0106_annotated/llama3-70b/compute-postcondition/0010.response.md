Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated values; `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` and `n` minus that absolute difference, multiplied by 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; the function prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
