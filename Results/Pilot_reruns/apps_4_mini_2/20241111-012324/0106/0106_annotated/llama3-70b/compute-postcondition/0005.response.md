To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers from input.
- `a` and `b` are distinct integers from input.
- `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
- `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.

### Code Execution:
```
b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```
- The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. 
- This means we perform integer division of `(b - 1)` by `(m * k)` and then add `1` to the result.

### Impact on Variables:
- The value of `b_block` depends on the current values of `b`, `m`, and `k`. 
- `n`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, and `b_floor` remain unaffected by this operation.

### Output State:
Thus, the output state includes all the initial variables along with the new value of `b_block` which is derived from the provided formula. The exact value of `b_block` will depend on the inputs for `b`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers from input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
