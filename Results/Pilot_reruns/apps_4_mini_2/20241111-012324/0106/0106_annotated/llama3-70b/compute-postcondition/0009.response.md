Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated values; `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` and `n` minus that absolute difference, multiplied by 15. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Otherwise, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
