To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider possible edge cases.

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the minimal time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Here's a breakdown of how the logic works:

1. **Locating Apartments**:
   - The function `get_location` calculates the block ( подъезд) and floor based on the apartment number. This part seems correct as it uses integer division and modulo operations to derive the right block and floor.

2. **Time Calculations**:
   - The time to exit the building from Edward's floor is calculated. If he is already on the first floor, the time is 0. Otherwise, it includes a lift wait time of 10 seconds plus the time taken to move down to the first floor.
   - The walking time between blocks is calculated in both directions (direct and reverse) to account for the circular nature of the building.
   - The time to reach the target floor at Natasha's apartment is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

3. **Total Time**:
   - Finally, the total time is computed by summing the time to exit, the walking time, and the time to reach the target floor.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:

1. **Single Block, Single Floor**:
   - For `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`, if Edward and Natasha are in apartments 1 and 2 respectively, the program will fail since it does not consider the case where both apartments fall within the same block.

2. **Edge Cases for Floor Calculation**:
   - If Edward starts on the first floor, he should not incur any exit time. The program accounts for this, but we need to ensure that it handles cases where both apartments are on the first floor.

3. **Maximum Values**:
   - For maximum values like `n = 1000, m = 1000, k = 1000`, we need to ensure the calculations remain efficient and do not lead to any overflow or incorrect indexing.

4. **Block Calculation**:
   - The calculation for the block using integer division could potentially lead to an off-by-one error, especially at the boundaries of the apartment numbering.

### Test Case Analysis:

Let's check a specific edge case: 
- If Edward lives in apartment 1 (which is the first apartment on the first floor of block 1) and Natasha lives in apartment 2 (which is the second apartment on the first floor of block 1).

In this case, the expected output should be `0`, as Edward is already next to Natasha. However, the algorithm calculates exit time, walking time, and could return a non-zero value.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, I can conclude that the program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically the case where both apartments are on the first floor or when the apartments are in the same block. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
