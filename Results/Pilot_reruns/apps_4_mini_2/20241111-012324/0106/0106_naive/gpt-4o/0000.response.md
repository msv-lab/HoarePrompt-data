To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes in `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the number of blocks, floors per block, apartments per floor, and the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha, respectively.

2. **Location Calculation**: 
   - The function `get_location` calculates the block and floor for a given apartment number.
   - It determines the block by dividing the apartment number by the total number of apartments per block (`m * k`).
   - It calculates the floor within the block and then derives the actual floor number by dividing by `k`.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - If Edward is on the first floor, `time_to_exit` is `0`. If not, it calculates the time to exit using the elevator which takes `10` seconds to arrive and `1` second for each floor he descends.
   - It calculates the time taken to walk directly to Natasha's block and also considers the reverse direction.
   - Finally, it calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor and sums it all up to get `total_time`.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Same Block**: If Edward and Natasha are in the same block but different floors, the calculation should be straightforward with no need for walking between blocks.
   
2. **First Floor**: If Edward lives on the first floor, the elevator time should be `0`, but if he needs to go down to the first floor from a higher floor, that time calculation must reflect the elevator wait and travel time accurately.

3. **Circular Movement**: The walking time should account for the circular nature of the building. For example, if Edward is in block `n` and Natasha is in block `1`, the program should correctly calculate the shorter path (either clockwise or counterclockwise).

4. **Maximum Values**: Testing with maximum values of `n`, `m`, and `k` to ensure that calculations do not lead to overflow or incorrect divisions.

5. **Edge Cases for Apartment Numbers**: The program should handle cases where the apartments are at the extreme ends, such as `1` and `n * m * k`.

### Testing the Function:

Let's illustrate with a specific test case:

- **Test Case**: Suppose `n = 4`, `m = 10`, `k = 5`, `a = 200`, `b = 6`.
   - Edward is in block `4`, floor `10`. 
   - Natasha is in block `1`, floor `2`.
   - The expected time to move would be calculated based on all possible paths, including using the elevator.

Through careful analysis of the code, we notice that it does not account for using the elevator correctly when Edward starts on the first floor and needs to go to other floors or blocks. The program assumes that it can directly calculate walking time without considering the elevator properly for every scenario.

### Conclusion:

There are test cases where the logic does not account for specific scenarios properly, especially involving the elevator's effectiveness and timing. Thus, 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where the elevator is necessary correctly, particularly when moving between blocks if Edward is already on the first floor or when calculating the optimal path properly accounting for the elevator.
