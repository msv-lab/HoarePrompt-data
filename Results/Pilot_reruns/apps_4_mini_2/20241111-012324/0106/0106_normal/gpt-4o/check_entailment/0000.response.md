To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze both the code and the problem description. 

### Analysis of the Code and Problem Description:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Edward lives in an apartment `a`, and Natasha lives in apartment `b`.
   - The building consists of `n` blocks (entrances), each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments.
   - The task is to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment considering the various movement times: 5 seconds to move between floors, 15 seconds to move between blocks, and 10 seconds for the elevator to arrive plus 1 second for each floor.

2. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - It first retrieves the location (block and floor) of both apartments using `get_location`.
   - It calculates the exit time based on whether Edward is on the first floor.
   - It computes the walking time between blocks in both directions (direct and reverse).
   - It then calculates the time to get to Natasha's floor and sums these times to get the total time.

3. **Functionality of `get_location`:**
   - This function calculates which block and floor an apartment is located in based on its number.
   - It does this using integer division and modulus operations.

### Edge Cases:
- If Edward is on the first floor, the exit time is correctly set to 0.
- If both apartments are in the same block, the walking time should be 0, but the code handles that by calculating the minimum walking time.
- The calculation of blocks and floors appears to be correct as long as the input values are within the defined limits.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints describe the expected functionality of both functions. They note that:
- `func_1` handles the time calculations based on various conditions, including edge cases where `a` is on the first floor.
- `get_location` returns the proper block and floor based on the apartment number but does not handle cases where the apartment number exceeds the total apartments.

### Issues Found:
- The `get_location` function does not handle cases where the apartment number exceeds the total apartments defined by `n`, `m`, and `k`. If an invalid apartment number is provided (greater than `n * m * k`), it will yield incorrect results, which is a critical oversight in the program.
  
### Conclusion:
Since there is a potential case where the code can fail (invalid apartment numbers leading to incorrect block/floor calculations), the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
