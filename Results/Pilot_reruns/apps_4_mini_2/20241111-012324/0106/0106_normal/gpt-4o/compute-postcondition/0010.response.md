Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned from the function `get_location(b)`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`; `min_walk_time` is the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`; `total_time` is calculated as `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`, and the function returns `total_time`.**
