The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`. After executing the function body, it calculates a value `total_time` based on various calculations involving the parameters. The function ultimately returns `total_time`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000) and distinct integers a, b (within the range of 1 to n·m·k), and returns the total time calculated based on these inputs.**
