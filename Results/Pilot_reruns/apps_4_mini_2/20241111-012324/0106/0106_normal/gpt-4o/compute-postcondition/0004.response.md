The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The value of `apartment` is an integer such that \(1 \leq apartment \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\). After executing the function body, it calculates `floor_within_block` as \((apartment - 1) \% (m \cdot k)\), and determines `floor` as \((\text{floor_within_block} // k) + 1\). The function then returns `block` and `floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding `block` and `floor` within the specified apartment structure. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the corresponding block and floor based on the apartment number within a defined structure.**
