To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the `func_1` function.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that we can perform a sequence of operations described. The operations consist of assigning values from the list `a`, starting with the first element, and each subsequent value must be formed by adding the values of existing variables.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The list `a` is sorted.
   - A set `assigned` is used to keep track of values that have been assigned to variables.
   - The first element of `a` is assigned to the first variable, initializing `m` to 1.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each subsequent value in `a`, it checks if the current value can be represented as the sum of two previously assigned values.
   - If it can, it continues; if it cannot, it increments `m` (indicating that another variable is needed).

3. **Final Decision**:
   - The function returns `m`, which is the count of variables needed.

### Potential Edge Cases:
From the problem description, there are certain cases that could cause the function to fail:
- **Non-formable cases**: If a value in `a` cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned values, we need to ensure that `m` is incremented correctly.
- **Examples where it cannot be formed**: 
   - For the input `3, 6, 5`, the function should return `-1` since you cannot form 5 and 6 using previous sums. However, the current logic might not handle this correctly as it might add unnecessary variables but still fail to create the required sums.

### Specific Case to Test:
Testing with the input `3, 6, 5`:
- **Expected Output**: -1
- **Actual Output**: The function might increment `m` incorrectly without recognizing that it's impossible to form these numbers correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the scenario where it is impossible to form the required sums based on the previous values correctly, as demonstrated above. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **False**.
