Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating that a valid pair can be formed, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, and no changes to the other variables occur.***
