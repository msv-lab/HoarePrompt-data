According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `x` which takes values from the `assigned` collection. The loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in `assigned` to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains the element `a[current_i + 2]`, and `x` is equal to this element. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are more elements remaining in `assigned` after the current value of `x`.

If `assigned` still contains additional elements, `x` needs to take on the next value from the `assigned` collection. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `x` to reflect the next element in the `assigned` collection.

State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` contains the element `a[current_i + 3]`, and `x` is equal to `a[current_i + 3]`**
