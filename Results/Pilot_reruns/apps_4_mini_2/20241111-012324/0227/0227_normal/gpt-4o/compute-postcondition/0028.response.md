Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the expression `a[i] - x` evaluates to an element in `assigned`, while `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` contains the element `a[current_i + 1]`, and `x` is equal to `a[current_i + 1]`. If the expression does not evaluate to an element in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False and no changes occur to `m`, `assigned`, or `x`.***
