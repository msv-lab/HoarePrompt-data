The value of `can_form` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True`. The other variables `m`, `assigned`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[k + 1]`, `i` is k + 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[k + 1]`, `i` is k + 1**
