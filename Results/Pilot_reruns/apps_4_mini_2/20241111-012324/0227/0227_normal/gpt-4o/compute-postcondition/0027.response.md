The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` contains the element `a[current_i + 1]`, `x` is `a[current_i + 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
