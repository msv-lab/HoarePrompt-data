The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. The function calculates `m`, which is the count of unique integers from the list `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two integers in the assigned set. The function then returns `m`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers `a`, and returns the count of unique integers from `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two integers in the assigned set.**
