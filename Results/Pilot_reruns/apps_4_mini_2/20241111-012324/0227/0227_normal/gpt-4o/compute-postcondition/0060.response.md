Output State: **If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1. `assigned` includes `a[i]`, and `i` is updated to `k + 1`. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False, and `m` remains unchanged. If `can_form` is True, it indicates that there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, and in this case, `m` remains unchanged.**
