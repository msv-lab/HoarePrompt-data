The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers `a`. It returns the count of integers from the list `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two integers in the set of already assigned integers. The count starts at 1 since the first element is always assigned, and if `n` is 1, the function returns 1, as there are no other integers to compare.
