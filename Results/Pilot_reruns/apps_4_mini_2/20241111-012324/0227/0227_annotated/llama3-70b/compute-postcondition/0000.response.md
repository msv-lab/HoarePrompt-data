The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, the output state will reflect that `n` now holds an input integer within that range. The list `a` remains unaffected as no operations are performed on it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer a_k satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9**.
