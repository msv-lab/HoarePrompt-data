The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is 1, so after execution, `m` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the sorted list of n integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is the sorted list of n integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1**
