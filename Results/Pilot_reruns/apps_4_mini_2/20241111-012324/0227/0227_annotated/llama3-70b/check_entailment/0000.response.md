Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the operations described in the problem statement. 

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to assign values to variables `b_i` such that the first operation places `a_1` in one variable, and each subsequent operation requires us to assign the sum of two variables to another variable, with the result equal to `a_t`.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code starts by sorting the array `a` and initializes `m` to 1.
   - It then iterates through the sorted array and increments `m` whenever the current element is not double the previous element (`a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2`).
   - Finally, it checks if `m` exceeds 23 and returns `-1` if it does, otherwise it prints the value of `m`.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The approach of simply counting how many elements do not follow the doubling condition (`a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2`) is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of variables needed. This logic does not account for cases where certain sums can be formed from the previously assigned variables or how the operations can be sequenced.
   - For instance, the case `3, 6, 5` is handled incorrectly. The expected output is `-1` since it is impossible to assign the values as required. However, due to the logic used, it would incorrectly return `2` since it only checks the doubling condition.
   - The code does not handle cases where the values in `a` themselves do not permit any valid operations, which should lead to a return value of `-1`.

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
- The correct output is `-1` because there is no way to assign values to the variables to satisfy the conditions.
- However, according to the logic in the program, it would increment `m` based on the comparison and incorrectly yield a positive number.

The annotations suggest that the program counts elements that do not follow a specific condition, but this does not align with the need to validate the sequences of operations required to achieve the results specified in the problem description.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
