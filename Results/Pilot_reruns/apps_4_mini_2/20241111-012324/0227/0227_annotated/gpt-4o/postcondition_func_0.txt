The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a list of distinct integers `a`. It returns `1` if `n` is `1`. If `n` is greater than `1`, it counts how many elements in `a` cannot be formed by the difference of any two previously assigned elements from `a` and returns that count as `m`. So the function identifies elements in `a` that are not the result of subtracting any two distinct elements from the set of previously processed elements.
