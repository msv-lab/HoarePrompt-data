Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists a distinct integer in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned` for at least one `x` in `assigned`. If no such `x` exists, then `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. Also, `n` is at least 2, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `assigned` is a set containing at least one distinct integer `a[0]` from the sorted list `a`.**
