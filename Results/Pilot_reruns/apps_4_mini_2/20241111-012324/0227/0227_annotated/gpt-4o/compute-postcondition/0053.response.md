The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. The values of the other variables, `assigned` and `x`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `assigned` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `can_form` is True.

Output State: **`assigned` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `can_form` is True**
