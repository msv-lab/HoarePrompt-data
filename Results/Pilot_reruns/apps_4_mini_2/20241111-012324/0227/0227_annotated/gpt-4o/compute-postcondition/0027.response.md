The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` is a non-empty set of distinct integers, `n` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2 depending on `can_form`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
