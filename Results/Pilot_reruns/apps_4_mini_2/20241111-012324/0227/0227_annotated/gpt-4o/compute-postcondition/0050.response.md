The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `assigned` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list; `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
