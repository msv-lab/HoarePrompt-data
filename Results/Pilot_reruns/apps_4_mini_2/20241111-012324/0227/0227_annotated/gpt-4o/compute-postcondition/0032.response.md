Postcondition: ***`assigned` is a non-empty set of distinct integers, `n` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2 depending on `can_form`, and `i` is 2. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
