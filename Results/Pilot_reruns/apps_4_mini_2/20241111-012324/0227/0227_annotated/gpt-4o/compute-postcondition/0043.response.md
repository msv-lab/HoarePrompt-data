The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `assigned` includes the element `a[k]`, `i` is k + 1, and `n` is greater than k + 1; `can_form` is now False.

Output State: **`m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `assigned` includes the element `a[k]`, `i` is k + 1, and `n` is greater than k + 1; `can_form` is now False**
