Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, and the program continues without changes to the other variables.***
