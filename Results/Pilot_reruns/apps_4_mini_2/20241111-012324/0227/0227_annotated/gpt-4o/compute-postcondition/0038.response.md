Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. If `n` is at least 2 and `assigned` contains distinct integers, then the loop will execute for each element in `assigned`. If no elements satisfy the condition, `can_form` will remain False.**
