Postcondition: ***`m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False. `assigned` is a list containing at least one element, with `x` as its first element. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is exited. If `can_form` remains False, then `m` is increased by 1; otherwise, `can_form` is True and the loop terminates without changing `m`.***
