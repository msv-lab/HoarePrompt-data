The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The initial values of the other variables (`n`, `assigned`, `a`, `m`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `can_form` while maintaining the status of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False**
