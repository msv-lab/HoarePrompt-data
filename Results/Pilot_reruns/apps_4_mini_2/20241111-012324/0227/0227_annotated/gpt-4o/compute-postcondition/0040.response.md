Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1, while `can_form` remains unchanged. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. This means that if there are no elements in `assigned` that satisfy the condition or if `assigned` is empty, the value of `m` will increase by 1; otherwise, `m` will remain the same.***
