The function returns the string 'No'. The values of the variables do not change as a result of the return statement. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state of the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function returns 'No'**
