Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` has been seen before (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function returns 'No'. If `remainder` has not been seen, the function does not return anything, and the state of `seen_remainders` remains unchanged.***
