Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where both must fall within the range of 1 to 10^18. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the function checks the unique remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1, which is not applicable given the input constraints. **
