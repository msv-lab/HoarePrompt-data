The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. The value of `i` is `k + 1`, and since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` will always be at least 2. The variable `n` is an input integer. The variable `remainder` will thus be either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `n` and `i`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now includes `remainder`, which is either 0 or 1, `i` is k + 1, and `remainder` is n % (k + 1)**.
