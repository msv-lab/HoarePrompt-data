The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. Given that `i` is 2, `remainder` will be `n % 2`, which is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The values of `n`, `k`, `seen`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is updated to include `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
