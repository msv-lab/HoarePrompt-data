To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description Analysis
The task is to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The conditions for correctness can be summarized as follows:
1. For each integer `i` in the range from `1` to `k`, compute the remainder `n % i`.
2. Ensure that no two different integers `i` and `j` (where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`) yield the same remainder.

### Code Review
The provided code snippet does the following:
1. It reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an empty set called `seen`.
3. It iterates through all integers `i` from `1` to `k`.
4. For each `i`, it computes the remainder `n % i`.
5. It checks if this remainder is already in the `seen` set. If it is, the program prints 'No' and exits. If not, it adds the remainder to the set.
6. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints 'Yes'.

### Edge Case Consideration
Now, we need to think about potential edge cases:
- The case where `k` is `1` should return 'Yes' because the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is `0`, and there's no other remainder to compare against.
- When `n` is equal to `k`, `n % k` will yield `0`, and `n % (k-1)` will yield `1`, so they are distinct.
- The code handles the case where `k` is much larger than `n`, as it will still calculate distinct remainders for all `i`.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints provide a clear summary of the program's functionality:
- The hints confirm that the program checks for uniqueness of the remainders and prints 'No' if any remainder is repeated and 'Yes' if all remainders are unique.
- The hints also mention specific cases like `n = 4`, `k = 4` returning 'No', which aligns with our reasoning.

### Conclusion
After thorough analysis, the code seems to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The potential edge cases have been considered, and the program behaves as expected for those cases.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Correctness: **True**.
