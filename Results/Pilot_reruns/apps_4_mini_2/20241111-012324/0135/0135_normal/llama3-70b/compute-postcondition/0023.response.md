The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. However, since the function definition does not include any parameters, it is implied that the function operates independently of any input parameters. The output or return value of the function is not specified in the provided information. 

Consequently, the functionality of the function `func` is unclear without additional context regarding its output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
