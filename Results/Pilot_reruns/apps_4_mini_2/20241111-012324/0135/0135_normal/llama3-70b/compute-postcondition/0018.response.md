Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 3; `seen` is either {0} or {0, 1}; `i` is 3; `remainder` is `n % 3`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues executing without printing 'No' or exiting.***
