Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is {0}, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits without changing the state. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution without any side effects.***
