The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, then checks the uniqueness of the remainders obtained by dividing `n` by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during this process, the function outputs 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it outputs 'Yes'. The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.
