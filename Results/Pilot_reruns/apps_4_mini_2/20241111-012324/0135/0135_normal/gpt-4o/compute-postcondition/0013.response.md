Output State: **If `k` is at least 1, the loop would have executed exactly `k` times, but since the return statement is `return 'Yes'`, it indicates that no remainders were found in `seen_remainders`, which means the function concludes with 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set, also leading to the conclusion of 'Yes'. Therefore, the final output state is that the function returns 'Yes'.**
