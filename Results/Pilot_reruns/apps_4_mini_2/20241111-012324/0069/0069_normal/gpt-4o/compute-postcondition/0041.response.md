The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, so the output state reflects the change. The states of the other variables (`prefix_balances`, `results`, `T`, `n`, `x`, `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` contains the prefix balance values for each index from 1 to `n`; `results` is updated based on conditions met; `T` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`; `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]` and `index` is increased by 3.
