The code assigns a new value to `prefix_balances[i]`. The new value is computed as `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. 

- `prefix_balances[i - 1]` can be either 2, 0, or -2, depending on the value of `i`.
- The value of `s[i - 1]` determines whether we add 1 or subtract 1. 
- The possible cases for `s[i - 1]` are that it can be '0' or not '0'.

Assuming:
1. If `s[i - 1]` is '0', we add 1 to `prefix_balances[i - 1]`.
2. If `s[i - 1]` is not '0', we subtract 1 from `prefix_balances[i - 1]`.

Given that `i` is 3:
- If `prefix_balances[2]` (which is `prefix_balances[i - 1]`) is 2 and `s[2]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[3]` would be 3.
- If `prefix_balances[2]` is 2 and `s[2]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[3]` would be 1.
- If `prefix_balances[2]` is 0 and `s[2]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[3]` would be 1.
- If `prefix_balances[2]` is 0 and `s[2]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[3]` would be -1.
- If `prefix_balances[2]` is -2 and `s[2]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[3]` would be -1.
- If `prefix_balances[2]` is -2 and `s[2]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[3]` would be -3.

Since `prefix_balances[i]` can take multiple values based on the conditions, the output state will reflect the possible values. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 3, 1, 1, -1, -1, or -3; `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is either 2, 0, or -2; `i` is 3; `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
