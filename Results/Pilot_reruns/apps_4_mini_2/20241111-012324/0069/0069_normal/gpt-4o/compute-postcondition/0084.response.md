Since the code provided appends -1 to the `results` list and does not change the state of any other variables, the output state will indicate that `-1` has been appended to `results`. The values of `prefix_balances` and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` remains unchanged; `-1` has been appended to `results`.**
