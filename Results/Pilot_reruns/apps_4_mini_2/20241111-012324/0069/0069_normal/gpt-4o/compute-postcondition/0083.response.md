Output State: **`prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's differences up to index `n`, where each `prefix_balances[i]` reflects the balance calculated from `s[0]` to `s[i-1]`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, and `prefix_balances[1]` will be either 1 or -1 based on `s[0]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
