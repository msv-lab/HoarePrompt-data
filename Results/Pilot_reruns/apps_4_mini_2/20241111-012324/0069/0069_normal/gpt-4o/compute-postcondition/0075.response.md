The variable `prefix_balances` is assigned a new list containing `n + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change other than the initialization of `prefix_balances`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new structure of `prefix_balances` along with the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros; `T` is greater than the current iteration count; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`; `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`; `index` is increased by 3; `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`.**
