According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must contain at least two values. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one value and `result` holds the first value from the list, so for the loop to be executed again, `results` must contain at least two values, and `result` should now reference the second value in the list.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` contains at least 2 values, `result` is the second value in the list**
