According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, which means that the range for `i` will produce at least one value. Given that `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, it will be valid as long as `n` is not negative. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` should start at 1, as specified in the `range(1, n + 1)` statement. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
