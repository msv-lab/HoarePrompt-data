According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 (the starting value of the loop), and `n` is not specified but is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to have executed at least once. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 (if `s[0]` is '0') or -1 (if `s[0]` is '1'); `prefix_balances` is updated accordingly, i is 2**
