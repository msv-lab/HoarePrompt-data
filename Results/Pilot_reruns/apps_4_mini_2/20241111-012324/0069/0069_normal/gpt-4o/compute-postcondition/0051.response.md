Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones based on the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i-1] + 1` if `s[i-1]` is '0', or `prefix_balances[i-1] - 1` if `s[i-1]` is '1'. The loop executes if `n` is at least 1, resulting in at least two elements in `prefix_balances` (length > 1). If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length 1.**
