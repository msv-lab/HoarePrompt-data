According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3 in the next iteration, and we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3, since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Since `n` is currently at least 1, we do not need to change that, but we should adjust `n` to ensure it is at least 3 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` will be 3
- `n` should be adjusted to be at least 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros (length > 1), `i` is 3, `n` is >= 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1**
