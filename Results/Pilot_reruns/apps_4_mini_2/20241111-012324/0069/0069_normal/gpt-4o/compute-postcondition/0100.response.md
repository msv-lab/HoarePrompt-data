Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's differences up to index `n`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`, indicating that `x` exists within the balances. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `0` is appended to `results`. In cases where `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and if `x` is not found, `results` will be `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` is updated to reflect this count. Overall, `results` will contain either `-1`, `0`, or a count of valid elements based on the conditions evaluated.***
