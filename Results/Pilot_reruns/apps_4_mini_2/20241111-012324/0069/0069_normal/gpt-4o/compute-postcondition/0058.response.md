Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 or 1, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
