To calculate the new state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the operations step by step:

1. The current value of `i` is `1`.
2. The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is being updated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]`.
3. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` checks the character at index `i - 1` of the string `s`. If that character is '0', it adds `1` to the previous balance; if it's '1', it subtracts `1`.
4. Assuming `prefix_balances` was initially a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[0]` is `0`.
5. Therefore, `prefix_balances[1]` will be updated to `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)`. Since `prefix_balances[0]` is `0`, this means:
   - If `s[0]` is '0', `prefix_balances[1]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - If `s[0]` is '1', `prefix_balances[1]` becomes `0 - 1 = -1`.

Now, since we don't know the exact value of `s[0]`, we can express the new value of `prefix_balances[1]` in terms of the character in `s`:

- If `s[0]` is '0', `prefix_balances[1]` is `1`.
- If `s[0]` is '1', `prefix_balances[1]` is `-1`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `prefix_balances[1]` based on the character at `s[0]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1'**
