The value at `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition checking the character at `s[i - 1]`. Since `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, the initial value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is 0. The value of `s[i - 1]` determines whether we add 1 (if `s[i - 1]` is '0') or subtract 1 (if `s[i - 1]` is not '0'). 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1, the index `i - 1` is 0, which is valid for the list.

Therefore, the output state depends on the character at `s[0]`:
- If `s[0]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
- If `s[0]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` becomes `0 - 1 = -1`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the condition based on `s[0]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[0]**
