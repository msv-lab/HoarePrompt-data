The variable `prefix_balances` is initialized as a list containing `n + 1` zeros. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. This assignment does not affect the other variables such as `T`, `x`, `s`, `data`, `index`, `results`, or `balance`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `prefix_balances` while maintaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer assigned from `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is calculated as `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
