According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to 1 (since the range starts at 1) and `n` is unknown but must be at least 1 for the loop to have executed previously. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to reflect this next iteration. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is not specified that it has changed.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1'; `i` is 2**
