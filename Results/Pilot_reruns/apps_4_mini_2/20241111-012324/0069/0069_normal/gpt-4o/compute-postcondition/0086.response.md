Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's differences up to index `n`. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`, indicating that `x` exists within the balances. Otherwise, `0` is appended to `results`, indicating that `x` does not exist in `prefix_balances`. In cases where `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and `results` is updated accordingly based on the presence of `x`.***
