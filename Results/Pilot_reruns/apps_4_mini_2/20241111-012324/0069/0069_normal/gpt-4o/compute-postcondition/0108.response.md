The code prints the value of `result`, which is the third value in the list `results`. The value of `result` is not explicitly stated, but it is known to be the third value in `results`. The operation does not change any variable states. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` contains at least 3 values, `result` is the third value in the list, and the function prints the value of `result`.**
