Output State: **After executing the loop `T` times, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values of '0's and '1's for each string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1 for that iteration. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found, `results` contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains the count of indices `b` in `prefix_balances` where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. If `n` is 0, `prefix_balances` will just be [0], leading to results being 0 if `balance` is 0 or count being 0 for any other case. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list. Therefore, `results` could contain multiple -1, 0, or counts based on the evaluations performed within the loop.**
