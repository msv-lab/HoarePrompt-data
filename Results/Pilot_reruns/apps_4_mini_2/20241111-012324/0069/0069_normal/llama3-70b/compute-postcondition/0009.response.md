Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Note that if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special consideration is needed as the division would be invalid, and this case should handle potential division by zero appropriately.***
