The values of `n` and `x` are assigned from the input, where `input().split()` retrieves a line of input as a string, splits it into separate components, and `map(int, ...)` converts those components into integers. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and the state of `T` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n` and `x` from the input.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`**
