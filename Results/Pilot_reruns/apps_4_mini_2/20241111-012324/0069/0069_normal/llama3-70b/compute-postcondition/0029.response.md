Postcondition: ***`balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `T` is greater than `current_iteration`, or `T` is adjusted to `current_iteration + 1`; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed, indicating that `x` is an exact multiple of the balance difference. Otherwise, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which reflects the calculated adjustment based on the difference between `x` and the balance. This covers cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a division by zero, and ensures that the output appropriately handles both scenarios.***
