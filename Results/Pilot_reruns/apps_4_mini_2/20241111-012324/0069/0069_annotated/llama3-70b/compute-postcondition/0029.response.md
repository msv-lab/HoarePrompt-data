Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is updated to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `T` is decremented by 1. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that the case where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` is handled since it would lead to division by zero unless `(x - balance)` is also zero, in which case the output will also be -1.***
