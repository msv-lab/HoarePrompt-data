Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the integer division of `(x - balance)` by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` incremented by 1. This covers the case where `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, which could lead to a division by zero, as well as the scenarios where the balance is equal to `x`, resulting in specific outputs.***
