The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition evaluating `s[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, we look at `prefix_balances[2]`, which is already defined as `prefix_balances[1]` plus (1 if `s[1]` is '0' else -1). 

After executing the code:
- `prefix_balances[3]` is calculated as `prefix_balances[2] + (1 if s[2] == '0' else -1)`.
- The previous state of `prefix_balances[2]` is already defined from the initial state.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updates based on the aforementioned calculations. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated at index 3 based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the value of `s[2]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `prefix_balances[2]` is equal to `prefix_balances[1]` plus (1 if `s[1]` is '0' else -1)**
