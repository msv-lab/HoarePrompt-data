The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` retrieves the element from the `data` list at the position `index + 1`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `x` will take the value of `int(data[2])`. Since `T` is greater than 0, but we do not have the specific contents of the `data` list, we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer from data[index], `x` is assigned the value of int(data[2]), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list containing at least one element, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
