Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance based on the characters in `s`, where each '0' increments the balance by 1 and each '1' decrements it by 1. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` from index 1 to index `n`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains filled with zeros.**
