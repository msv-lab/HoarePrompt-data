Output State: **`results` is a list containing the calculated values based on the conditions of `balance` and the presence of `x` in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's where each '0' increments the balance and each '1' decrements it. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with -1; if `x` is not found, `results` is appended with 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of instances in `prefix_balances` satisfying `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, which is then appended to `results`. If `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` will remain initialized as a list of zeros with a single element, and the loop does not execute, resulting in `results` remaining unchanged.**
