Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` after processing the first `n` characters, where `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated as `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0' or minus 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '1'. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains initialized to zeros.**
