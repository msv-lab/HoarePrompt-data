Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` after processing the first `n` characters, where `n` is at least 1, or remains initialized to zeros if `n` is less than 1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with -1; if `x` is not found, `results` is appended with 0, and in both cases, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated as the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. Additionally, if `n < 1`, the function handles the case where `prefix_balances` is empty, ensuring that the logic accounts for the absence of valid balances.***
