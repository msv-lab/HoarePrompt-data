The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `data`, and `results`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list containing at least one element, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list containing at least one element, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list**
