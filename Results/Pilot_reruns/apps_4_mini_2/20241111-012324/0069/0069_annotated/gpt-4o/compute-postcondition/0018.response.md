According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to 4. The condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 3 does not need adjustment, as it allows for `i` to be 4 as long as `n` is at least 4.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `s[2]`, `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is unchanged, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
