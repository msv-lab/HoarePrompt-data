The value at `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`. The variable `i` is 1, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i - 1` is 0, which is valid for accessing the first element of `prefix_balances`. The entry `prefix_balances[0]` is initially 0. The value of `s[i - 1]` is `s[0]`, and we check if it is '0' or not.

If `s[0]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be updated to `prefix_balances[0] + 1`, resulting in `prefix_balances[1]` being 1. If `s[0]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be updated to `prefix_balances[0] - 1`, resulting in `prefix_balances[1]` being -1. The values of `n` and `i` are not changed, but `prefix_balances` is modified.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the value of `prefix_balances` at index 1 based on `s[0]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index 1 based on the value of `s[0]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
