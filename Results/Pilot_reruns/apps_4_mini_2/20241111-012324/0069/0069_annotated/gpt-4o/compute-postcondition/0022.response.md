Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` after processing the first `n` characters, where `n` is at least 1, or remains initialized to zeros if `n` is less than 1. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with 0. In both cases, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged.***
