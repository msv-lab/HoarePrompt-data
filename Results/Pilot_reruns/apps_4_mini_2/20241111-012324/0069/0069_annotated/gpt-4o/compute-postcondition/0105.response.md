According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 2 elements, and the next `result` needs to be the second element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list with at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, result is the second element in the list**
