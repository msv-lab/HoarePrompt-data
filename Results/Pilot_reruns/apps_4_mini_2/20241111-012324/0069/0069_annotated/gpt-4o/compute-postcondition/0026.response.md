Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is 0 initially, and `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
