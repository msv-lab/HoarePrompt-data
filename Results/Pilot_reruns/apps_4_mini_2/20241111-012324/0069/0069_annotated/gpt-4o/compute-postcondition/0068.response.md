Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, with `prefix_balances[0]` being 0. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with -1; if `x` is not found, `results` is appended with 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of instances where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` for each `b` in `prefix_balances`, and this `count` is appended to `results`. Additionally, if `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1, and `results` will be updated based on the presence of `x` in the list, resulting in either -1 or 0 being appended.***
