According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, since it iterates from 1 to `n + 1`. The variable `i` will start at 1 at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and at the start of the loop, `i` is 1. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
