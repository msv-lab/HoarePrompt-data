The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list with a size of `n + 1`, where `n` has been previously assigned a value based on `int(data[index])`. Since the initial state specifies that `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, this means the first element of the list is explicitly set to 0. The remaining elements of the list will be initialized to 0 as well since the multiplication operation `[0] * (n + 1)` creates a list filled with zeros.

The output state does not change any other variables, and no return value is specified in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `prefix_balances` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` filled with zeros**
