According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least 1 element. If `n` is less than 1, then `results` remains unchanged and cannot have any elements. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `results` must contain at least 1 calculated value.

State: **`results` is a list with at least 1 element, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
