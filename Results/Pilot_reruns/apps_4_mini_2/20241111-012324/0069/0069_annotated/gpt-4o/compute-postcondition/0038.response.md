The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` represents an element from the `data` list at the specified `index`. The `int` function converts this element to an integer. The values of `prefix_balances` and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the original state of `prefix_balances` and `T`, along with the new value of `n` which is derived from `data[index]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
