Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases where each case includes a binary string. It calculates a balance based on the counts of '0's and '1's in the string and determines how many valid transformations can achieve a target value `x`. If the balance is zero, it checks if `x` is present in the prefix balances and returns -1 if true or 0 if false. If the balance is not zero, it counts instances in the prefix balances that can satisfy the transformation conditions and appends this count to the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. **
