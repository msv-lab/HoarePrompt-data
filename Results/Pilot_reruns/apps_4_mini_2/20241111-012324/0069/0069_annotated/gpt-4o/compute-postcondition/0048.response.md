According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the value that was used in the previous iteration. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration to execute.

Since the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1`. The value of `n` does not change, so it remains as is.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`prefix_balances[2]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[1]` and the value of `s[1]`, resulting in `prefix_balances[2]` being either `prefix_balances[1] + 1` or `prefix_balances[1] - 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged**
