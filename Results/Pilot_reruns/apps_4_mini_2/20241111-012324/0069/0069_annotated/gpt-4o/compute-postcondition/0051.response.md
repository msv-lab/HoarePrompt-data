Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i-1] + 1` if `s[i-1]` is '0' or `prefix_balances[i-1] - 1` if `s[i-1]` is '1'. If `n` is less than 1 (i.e., `n` is 0 or negative), the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1.**
