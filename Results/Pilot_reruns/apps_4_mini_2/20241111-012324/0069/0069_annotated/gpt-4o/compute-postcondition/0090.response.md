Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is incremented by 1 if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true, where `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`; otherwise, `count` remains 0. The conditions ensure that the difference between `x` and `b` is a multiple of `balance` and non-negative.***
