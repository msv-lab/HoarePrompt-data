The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `x` is an integer that can range from -10^9 to 10^9.
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`, consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The function processes these inputs and returns results based on certain conditions evaluated from the binary string `s` and the integer `x`. However, since the output specifics are not detailed, we will summarize the general return based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T, n, x, and s, and processes them based on certain conditions to return results related to the binary string and the integer value.**
