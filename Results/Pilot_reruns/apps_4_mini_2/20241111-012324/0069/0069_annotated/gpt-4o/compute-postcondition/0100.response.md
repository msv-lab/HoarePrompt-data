Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance based on the characters in `s`, where each '0' increments the balance by 1 and each '1' decrements it by 1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true, and `results` includes this `count`. This logic accounts for the cases where `n` is 0 or less, ensuring `prefix_balances` remains filled with zeros.***
