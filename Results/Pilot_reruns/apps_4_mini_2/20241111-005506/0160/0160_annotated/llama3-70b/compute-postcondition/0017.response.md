To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we have `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1.
   - The loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.
   - The current value of `i` is 1. 

3. **Determining the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented.
   - After the first iteration (with `i` equal to 1), the next value of `i` would be 2.

4. **Adjustment of `gcd`**:
   - The loop's range is defined by the maximum value of `i`, which is `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and it will increment to 2, we need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Conclusions**:
   - Therefore, the current `gcd` must be at least 4 (since the square root of 4 is 2) to allow `i` to reach 2.
   - The current `i` will also be updated to 2 in the next iteration.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted state should reflect that `gcd` is at least 4, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` remains unchanged.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `max_divisor` remains unchanged**.
