The variable `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `i` is 1, but the current value of `max_divisor` is not provided. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, it implies that `max_divisor` is also likely a positive integer. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_divisor` could either remain the same or be updated to 1, depending on its previous value.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1; `max_divisor` is updated to max(max_divisor, 1)**
