Output State: **If `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, then `max_divisor` will be the largest divisor of `gcd` found in the range from 1 to the square root of `gcd`. If `gcd` is 1, the loop executes only once, and `max_divisor` remains 1. If `gcd` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `max_divisor` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is equal to `gcd`. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` may not be updated further when `i * i` equals `gcd`.**
