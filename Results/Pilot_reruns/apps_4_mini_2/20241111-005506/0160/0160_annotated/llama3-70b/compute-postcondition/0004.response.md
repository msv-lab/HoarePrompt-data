The value of `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the element `A[i]`, where `i` is currently 1. Given that `gcd` is initially `A[0]`, the new value of `gcd` will depend on the specific value of `A[1]`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `A` are not affected, and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `gcd` based on the calculation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is the gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`, `i` is 1**
