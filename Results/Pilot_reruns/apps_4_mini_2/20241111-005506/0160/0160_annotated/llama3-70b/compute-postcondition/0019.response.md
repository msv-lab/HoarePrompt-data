The expression assigns `max_divisor` the maximum value between its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Given that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 4 and `i` is 2, the value of `gcd // i` will be at least 2. Depending on the initial value of `max_divisor`, it may either remain unchanged or be updated to a new value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible scenarios for `max_divisor`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is either unchanged or updated based on its comparison with at least 2.**
