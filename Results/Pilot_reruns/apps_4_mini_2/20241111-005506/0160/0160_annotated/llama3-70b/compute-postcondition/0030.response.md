The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. `N` is an integer that must be between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer that can be as large as 10^9, and `A` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^6. The function does not return any value based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `N`, a non-negative integer `K`, and a list of integers `A` with specific constraints but does not return any output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (integer between 2 and 500), K (non-negative integer up to 10^9), and A (list of N integers each between 1 and 10^6) without returning any value.**
