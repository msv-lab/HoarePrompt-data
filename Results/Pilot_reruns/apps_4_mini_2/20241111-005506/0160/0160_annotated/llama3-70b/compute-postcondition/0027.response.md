According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `gcd` is greater than 4. 

To determine if the loop will execute again, we need to check the value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

1. Since `gcd` is greater than 4, `math.sqrt(gcd)` will also be greater than 2.
2. The exact value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` depends on the actual value of `gcd`, but since `gcd` is greater than 4, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be at least 2.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Given that `i` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 4 for the loop to run again.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `gcd` is such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 4. This means `gcd` must be at least 16 (since the square root of 16 is 4).

The updated values:
- `gcd` should be adjusted to be at least 16.
- `i` should be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.

State: **`gcd` is at least 16, `i` is 4**
