The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `x` in reverse order. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list since the loop will not execute and no divisors can be found. If `x` is 1, the list will contain only 1. For prime numbers, the list will contain only 1 and the prime number itself.
