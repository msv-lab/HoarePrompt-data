Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is a set that includes `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`. Given that `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1, if `x` is divisible by `i`, the set of `divisors` will contain the elements 1 and `x`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the set of `divisors` remains empty.***
