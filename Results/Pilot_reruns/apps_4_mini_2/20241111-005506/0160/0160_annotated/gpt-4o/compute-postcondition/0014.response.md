Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, including both the divisor `i` and its complement `x // i` when `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is 1, the loop will execute once and `divisors` will include only 1. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is a prime number, `divisors` will contain only 1 and `x` itself. If `x` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set.**
