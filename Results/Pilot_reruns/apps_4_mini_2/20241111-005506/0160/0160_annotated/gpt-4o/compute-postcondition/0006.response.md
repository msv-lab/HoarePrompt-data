The `divisors` set is modified by adding the value of `i`, which is currently 2. Since `divisors` already includes 1 and `i` is a valid number (greater than or equal to 1), the new state of `divisors` will include the value 2 as well. The states of `N`, `K`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of 2 to the `divisors` set.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` includes 1 and 2, `i` is 2**
