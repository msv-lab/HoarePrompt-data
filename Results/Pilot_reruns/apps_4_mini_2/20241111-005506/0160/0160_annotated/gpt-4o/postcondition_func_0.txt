The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. It assumes that the list contains at least two integers, as the problem states N is between 2 and 500. If the list were to contain only one element or be empty, the behavior would not be defined, but it is implicitly guaranteed that the list will have at least two elements.
