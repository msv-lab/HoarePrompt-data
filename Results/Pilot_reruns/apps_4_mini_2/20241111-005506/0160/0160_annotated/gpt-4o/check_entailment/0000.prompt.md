You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    #State of the program here: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, and `gcd_result` is the first integer of `A`.
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_result` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, `num` is the last element processed from the list `A`, and `N` remains an integer between 2 and 500. If `N` is 2, the loop will execute once; if `N` is 3, it will execute twice, and so forth, up to `N-1` times. If `A` has only one element, or if it is empty (though the problem states N is between 2 and 500, thus it is implicitly guaranteed to have at least 2 elements), the loop does not execute and `gcd_result` remains as the first element of `A`.
    return gcd_result
    #State of the program after the return statement: `gcd_result` remains the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, and the function returns `gcd_result`
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. It assumes that the list contains at least two integers, as the problem states N is between 2 and 500. If the list were to contain only one element or be empty, the behavior would not be defined, but it is implicitly guaranteed that the list will have at least two elements.

#Function 2:
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    #State of the program here: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` is an empty set
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, including both the divisor `i` and its complement `x // i` when `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is 1, the loop will execute once and `divisors` will include only 1. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is a prime number, `divisors` will contain only 1 and `x` itself. If `x` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #State of the program after the return statement: `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and the function returns the sorted list of `divisors` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `x` in reverse order. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list since the loop will not execute and no divisors can be found. If `x` is 1, the list will contain only 1. For prime numbers, the list will contain only 1 and the prime number itself.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
