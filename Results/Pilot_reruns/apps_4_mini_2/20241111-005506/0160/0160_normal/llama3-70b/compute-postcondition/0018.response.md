The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 2, `max_divisor` will either remain unchanged if it is greater than 2 or be updated to 2 if it is less than or equal to 2. The value of `gcd` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and 2.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and 2**
