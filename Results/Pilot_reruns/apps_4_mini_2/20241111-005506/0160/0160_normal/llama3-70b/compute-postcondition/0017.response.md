According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. The current value of `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since the range is from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Therefore, we need to increase `i` to 2 for the loop to execute another iteration.

The value of `gcd` remains unchanged and does not need to be modified. The condition `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 is already satisfied.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated based on the value of `gcd` and the new value of `i`**.
