Output State: **`max_divisor` will be the largest divisor of `gcd` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(gcd)`, and `i` will be at least 1 and at most `sqrt(gcd)`. If `gcd` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and `max_divisor` will remain equal to its initial value. If `gcd` is 1, the loop will execute only once, and `max_divisor` will also be 1.**
