Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i` if `gcd` is divisible by `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` retains its value.***
