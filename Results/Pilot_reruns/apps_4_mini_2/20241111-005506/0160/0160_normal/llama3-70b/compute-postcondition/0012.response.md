According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `gcd`. The loop will execute if the value of `gcd` is at least 1, as the range for `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. If `gcd` is 0, the square root will not yield a positive upper limit for the loop. 

Before the loop starts, `gcd` should be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `i` will start at 1. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is set to 1.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`**
