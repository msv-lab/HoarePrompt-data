The function accepts two integers, `N` (between 2 and 500) and `K` (a non-negative integer up to 10^9), and a list of `N` integers `A` (each between 1 and 10^6). It computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the list `A` and then determines the largest divisor of the gcd. Finally, it prints this largest divisor. The function does not return a value; it only prints the result. Note that if the gcd is 1, the largest divisor will also be 1. The function does not handle cases where the input is malformed or outside the specified ranges.
