According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The loop will execute again if the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, which means that it is currently one more than the largest integer that is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set back to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, and the `i` in the loop should be adjusted accordingly.

Thus, the state needs to be modified to reflect that `i` is now equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))` and the loop can potentially execute for the maximum value of `i` which is now `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9; `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x))`, `x` is the same as before**
