The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is initialized to 1, after the execution, `divisors` will contain the value 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `divisors` is now {1}, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1.
