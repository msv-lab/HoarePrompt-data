According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition of the range. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented, which will make the condition `i <= int(math.sqrt(x))` false, thus preventing another iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the range. This means `int(math.sqrt(x))` must be at least 2; therefore, we need to set it to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, allowing `i` to take the next value in the range.

Since `x` is not provided, we can keep `x` as it is, but we must ensure that the loop's range condition allows for one more iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9; `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
