The code initializes `divisors` as an empty set. This means that `divisors` will now hold no values. The initial values of `N`, `A`, and `K` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, and `divisors` is an empty set.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, and `divisors` is an empty set.**
