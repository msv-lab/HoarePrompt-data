The statement `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The value of `i` is previously calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x))`, but since the value of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine `i` explicitly. However, we know that `divisors` is updated by adding the calculated value of `i`.

The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9; `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x))`; `divisors` now includes the value `i`.
