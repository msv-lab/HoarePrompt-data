The code adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The variable `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, which means it is calculated based on the value of `x`. The previous value of `divisors` is not specified, but now it will include the new value derived from `x // i`.

Given that `x` is an integer and `i` is determined from `x`, the value of `x // i` will yield an integer result. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `divisors` now includes this new calculated value based on the current state of `x` and `i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9; `i` is determined by `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`; `divisors` now includes `x // i`.**
