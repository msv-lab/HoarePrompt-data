The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. The function computes all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, collects them into a set, and then returns the sorted list of these divisors in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` and return a sorted list of its divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns a sorted list of all divisors of x that are less than or equal to sqrt(x), in reverse order.**
