The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The value of `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `x`, we can only state that `i` is determined by the square root of `x`. The set `divisors` is modified to include `i`, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9; `i` is determined by `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`; `divisors` now includes `i`.**
