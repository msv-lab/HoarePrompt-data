Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9; `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` includes both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the set `divisors` remains unchanged. Additionally, edge cases where `i` equals `x` or `i` equals `1` are handled since they are included in the set of potential divisors.***
