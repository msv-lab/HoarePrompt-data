Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` less than or equal to `sqrt(x)`, including both `i` and `x // i` for each `i` where `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is a perfect square, `divisors` will include the square root only once. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is 1, the loop will execute once, and `divisors` will contain only the number 1.**
