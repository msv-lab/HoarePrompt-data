The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates and prints the maximum distance between the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list, adjusted by their indices. This function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
