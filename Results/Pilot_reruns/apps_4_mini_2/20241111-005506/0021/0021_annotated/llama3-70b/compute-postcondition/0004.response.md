The variable `pos1` holds the index of `1` in the list `a`, and `posn` holds the index of `n` in the list `a`. The expression `abs(pos1 - posn)` calculates the absolute distance between these two indices. Then, we subtract `1` from this distance and compare it to `n - 2`. The maximum of these two values is assigned to `max_dist`.

Since the values of `pos1` and `posn` are not specified, but they are indices of the permutation of integers from `1` to `n`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in the list a; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
