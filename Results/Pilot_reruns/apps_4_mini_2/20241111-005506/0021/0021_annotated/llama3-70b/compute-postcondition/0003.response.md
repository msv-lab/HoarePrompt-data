`posn` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which will return the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The initial state does not provide the specific contents of `a`, but since `a` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `n` will definitely be present in `a`. Therefore, `posn` will hold a valid index based on the position of `n` in `a`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in the list a.**
