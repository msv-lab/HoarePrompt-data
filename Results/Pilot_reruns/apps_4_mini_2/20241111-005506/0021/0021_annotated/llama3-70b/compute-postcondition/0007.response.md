The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. After executing the function body, it processes the list `a` based on the permutation of integers. The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it likely involves evaluating or transforming the permutation in some way based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers that is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.**
