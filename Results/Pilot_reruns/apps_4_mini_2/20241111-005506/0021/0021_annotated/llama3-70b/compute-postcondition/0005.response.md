The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. This means we need to calculate two values: `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`, and then find the minimum of these two values.

1. `abs(pos1 - posn)` computes the absolute difference between the indices of `1` and `n` in the list `a`.
2. We then subtract `1` from this absolute difference.
3. The second value is simply `n - 2`.
4. Finally, we assign `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` to `min_dist`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `pos1`, `posn`, `max_dist`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in the list a; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
