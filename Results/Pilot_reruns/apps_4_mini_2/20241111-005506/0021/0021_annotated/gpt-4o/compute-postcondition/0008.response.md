The value of `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of these distances depend on the previously defined variables: `max_pos` and `min_pos`, which are related to the indices of occurrences of `n` in the list `a`.

Given that:
- `dist1` is the absolute distance from the start (0) to `max_pos`.
- `dist2` is the absolute distance from the end (n-1) to `max_pos`.
- `dist3` is the absolute distance from the start (0) to `min_pos`.
- `dist4` is the absolute distance from the end (n-1) to `min_pos`.

The maximum distance `max_distance` represents the furthest distance from either end of the list `a` to the positions of `n` and its minimum occurrence.

Since the exact values of `max_pos`, `min_pos`, `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are not provided, we can only state that `max_distance` is derived from these distances.

Output State: **`max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`**
