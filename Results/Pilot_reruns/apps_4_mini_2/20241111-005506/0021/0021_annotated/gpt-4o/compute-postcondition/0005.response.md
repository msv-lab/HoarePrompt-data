The variable `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The initial state informs us that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, and `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`.

The value of `dist2` will depend on the specific values of `n` and `max_pos`. Therefore, the output state will indicate the calculation of `dist2` while retaining the other variable states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos); `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
