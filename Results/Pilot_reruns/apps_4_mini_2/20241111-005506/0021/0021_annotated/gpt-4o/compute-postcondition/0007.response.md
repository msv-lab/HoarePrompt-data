To analyze the impact of the code, we need to consider the variables provided in the initial state.

- `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.
- `dist1` is calculated as `abs(0 - max_pos)`, which is the absolute distance from the start of the list to the position of `n`.
- `dist2` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, which is the absolute distance from the end of the list to the position of `n`.
- `dist3` is calculated as `abs(0 - min_pos)`, which is the absolute distance from the start of the list to the position of the smallest element in `a`.

Now, the code `dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)` calculates a new distance `dist4`, which is the absolute distance from the end of the list to the position of the smallest element in `a` (where `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of the minimum value in `a`).

Since the initial state defines these variables but does not provide specific values for `min_pos`, we can conclude that the output will involve the newly calculated `dist4` while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos); `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos); `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**
