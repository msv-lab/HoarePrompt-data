Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It calculates the maximum distance from the first occurrence of the integer `1` and the integer `n` to either end of the list (index 0 or index n-1). The result is printed as the maximum of these distances. The function does not handle cases where `1` or `n` are not present in the list, which would result in a ValueError since it uses `index()` to find their positions.**
