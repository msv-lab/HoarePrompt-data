The code assigns `max_pos` the value of `a.index(n)`, which means it finds the index of the first occurrence of the value `n` in the list `a`. Given that `n` is an integer within the range `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed an element of `a`. 

Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not provided, we can assume that `n` is present in `a` and can be found at some index. 

After executing the code, the state of the variables will reflect that `max_pos` has been assigned the index of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
