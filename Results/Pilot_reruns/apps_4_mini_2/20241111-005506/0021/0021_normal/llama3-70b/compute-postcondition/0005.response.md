To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. This means we need to calculate two values:
   - The first value is `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`.
   - The second value is `n - 2`.

2. The `min` function will then select the smaller of these two values.

Since `n`, `pos1`, and `posn` are defined based on the initial state, we can say:
- `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`.
- `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.
- The values of `n`, `pos1`, and `posn` are known based on the input provided.

After executing the code, `min_dist` will hold the minimum of the two calculated values, but exact numeric results are not possible without specific values for `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the definitions of the variables and the calculation that took place.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`, `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2), `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
