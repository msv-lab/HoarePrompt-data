The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. The function does not specify any output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, where each integer falls within the range of 1 to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers (each integer between 1 and n).**
