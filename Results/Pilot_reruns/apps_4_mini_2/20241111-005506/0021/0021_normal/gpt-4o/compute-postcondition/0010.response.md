The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to n. Based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function performs operations that will return a specific output based on the values in `a` and the integer `n`. 

However, since the output behavior of the function has not been specified, we cannot detail the specific return values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range 1 to n).**
