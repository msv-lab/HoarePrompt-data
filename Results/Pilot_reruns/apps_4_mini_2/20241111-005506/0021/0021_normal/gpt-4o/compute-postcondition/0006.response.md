The variable `dist3` is assigned the value `abs(0 - min_pos)`. The value of `min_pos` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `dist3`. However, `dist3` will be equal to the absolute value of `-min_pos`, which is `abs(min_pos)`. The values of `n`, `max_pos`, and `dist2` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of n in the list a; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(min_pos).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of n in the list a; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(min_pos)**.
