The variable `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are not specified in the initial state, but `dist2` is defined as `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, we can determine `dist2` based on these conditions.

However, without specific values for `dist1`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, we cannot determine the exact value of `max_distance`. Therefore, the output state reflects the known state of the affected variables and indicates that `max_distance` is determined by the maximum value calculated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `dist2` is abs(`n` - 1 - `max_pos`); `max_distance` is max(`dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, `dist4`)**
