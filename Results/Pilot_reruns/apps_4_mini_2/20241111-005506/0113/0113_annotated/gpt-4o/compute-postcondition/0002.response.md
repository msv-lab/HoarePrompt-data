To determine the output state, we first analyze the variables involved:

1. `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9.
2. `k` is a non-negative integer from 0 to 8.
3. `multiplier` is calculated as \( 10^k \).
4. `x` is computed as \( n \times \left(\frac{multiplier}{\text{math.gcd}(n, multiplier)}\right) \).

The return statement will return the value of `x`.

The calculation for `x` depends on the current values of `n` and `k`:
- We calculate `multiplier` as \( 10^k \).
- We compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`.
- We then calculate `x` using the formula provided.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we can only reference their potential values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `multiplier` is \( 10^k \); `x` is computed as \( n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{math.gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right) \); and the function returns `x`.**
