The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and converts them to integers. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8**
