The value of `x` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8, so `x` can take values from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `10000000000` (when `k` is `8`). The states of the other variables (`n` and `k`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8; `x` is an integer that can take values from 1 to 10000000000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8; `x` is an integer that can take values from 1 to 10000000000**
