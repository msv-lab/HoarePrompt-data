The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer ranging from 3 to 10^9 + 2, after the increment, `n` will now be between 4 and 10^9 + 3. The variable `x` remains unchanged but is still greater than the new value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer from 4 to 10^9 + 3, `x` is greater than the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 4 to 10^9 + 3, `x` is greater than the new value of `n`**
