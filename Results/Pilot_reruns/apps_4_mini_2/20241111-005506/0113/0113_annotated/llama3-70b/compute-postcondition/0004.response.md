The value of `n` is incremented by 1, and since `n` is a positive integer within the range 2 to 10^9 + 1, after execution, `n` will be at least 3 and at most 10^9 + 2. The value of `x` remains unaffected, but it is still greater than the new value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer from 3 to 10^9 + 2, `x` is greater than the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 3 to 10^9 + 2, `x` is greater than the new value of `n`**
