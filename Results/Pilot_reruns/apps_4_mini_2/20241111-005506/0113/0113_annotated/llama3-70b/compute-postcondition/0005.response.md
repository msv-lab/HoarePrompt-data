According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `x`. The loop continues as long as `n % x` is not equal to 0, meaning `n` is not divisible by `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `n` is a positive integer from 3 to 10^9 + 2.
- `x` is greater than the new value of `n`.

Since `x` is greater than `n`, it follows that `n % x` will always be `n` because `n` is less than `x`. Therefore, the condition `n % x != 0` will always hold true, allowing the loop to execute again.

There is no need to adjust the state since the current values already allow for another iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer from 3 to 10^9 + 2, `x` is greater than the new value of `n`**
