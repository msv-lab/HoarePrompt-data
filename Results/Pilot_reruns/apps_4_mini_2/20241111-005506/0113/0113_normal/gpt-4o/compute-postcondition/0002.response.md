The function returns `x`, which is assigned the value of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The return statement does not change the state of the other variables. Therefore, the output state will include the values of `n`, `k`, `multiplier`, and the returned value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000; and the function returns `x`, where `x` is assigned the value `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`.**
