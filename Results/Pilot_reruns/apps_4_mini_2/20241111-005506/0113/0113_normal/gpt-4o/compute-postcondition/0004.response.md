Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), calculates a `multiplier` as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and returns the value of `n` multiplied by `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. This effectively scales `n` based on the `multiplier` while ensuring it remains a multiple of `n`. **
