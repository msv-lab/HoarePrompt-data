The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer and can vary from `0` to `8`, the value of `multiplier` will correspond to `1`, `10`, `100`, `1000`, `10000`, `100000`, `1000000`, `10000000`, or `100000000`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the possible values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
