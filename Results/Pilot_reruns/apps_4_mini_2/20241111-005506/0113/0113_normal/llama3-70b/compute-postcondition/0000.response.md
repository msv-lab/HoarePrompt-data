The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input values provided by the user. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), their respective values will be set to whatever input is given. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input non-negative integer**
