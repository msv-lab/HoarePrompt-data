The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is adjusted to not be a multiple of 10, the exact new value of `n` will depend on its original value, but it will be one more than its current value. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now incremented by 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer, `x` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is now incremented by 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer, `x` is 10**
