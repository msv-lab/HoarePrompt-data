To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1(n, k)` and see if it handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

The program calculates the k-rounding of a given positive integer n, which is defined as the minimum positive integer x such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. It calculates `multiplier` as `10 ** k`, which gives us the smallest number with k zeros at the end (e.g., when k = 4, multiplier = 10000).
2. It uses the formula `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` to find the smallest multiple of n that is also a multiple of `multiplier`.

Now, we need to check if this logic correctly handles all possible cases:

- If `k = 0`: The output should be n itself (as it ends with 0 zeros). The formula would compute `x = n * (1)` since `gcd(n, 1) = n`. This works correctly.
  
- If `k > 0`: The program calculates the necessary multiple to ensure that the resulting number ends with at least k zeros and is a multiple of n. The use of `gcd` here helps to find the least multiple of n that meets the requirement.

### Test Cases

1. **Example Case**: (375, 4) should output 30000. This is correctly handled.
2. **Example Case**: (10000, 1) should output 10000. This is correctly handled.
3. **Example Case**: (38101, 0) should output 38101. This is correctly handled.
4. **Example Case**: (123456789, 8) should output 12345678900000000. This is correctly handled.

### Edge Cases

We also need to check edge cases:

- Test with the smallest values: (1, 0) should output 1; this is correctly handled.
- Test with the largest `n`: (10^9, 8) should output 10^9 * 10^8 = 10^17. The program should handle this as well.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic, running through various test and edge cases, the program consistently produces the expected outputs according to the problem description. 

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
