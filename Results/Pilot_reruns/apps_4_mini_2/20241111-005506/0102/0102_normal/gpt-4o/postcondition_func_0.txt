The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English word representation for numbers from 0 to 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For values from 10 to 99, if `n` is a multiple of 10, it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it returns a string in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. However, if `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not handle these cases and does not return any value, leading to potential undefined behavior.
