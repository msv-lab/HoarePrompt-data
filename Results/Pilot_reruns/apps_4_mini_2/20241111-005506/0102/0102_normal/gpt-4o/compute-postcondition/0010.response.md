Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones`. If `s` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from `tens`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string representation of `s` in the format `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`. If `s` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not execute the if block and thus does not return a value.***
