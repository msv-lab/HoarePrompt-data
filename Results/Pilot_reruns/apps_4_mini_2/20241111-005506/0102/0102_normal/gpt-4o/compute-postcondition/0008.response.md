Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from `tens` based on `s // 10`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string representation of `s` in the format `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`, which correctly handles edge cases such as `s` values of 10, 20, 30, up to 90, as well as the values 11 through 19. If `s` is less than 10 or greater than 99, the function does not execute the if block and thus does not return a value.***
