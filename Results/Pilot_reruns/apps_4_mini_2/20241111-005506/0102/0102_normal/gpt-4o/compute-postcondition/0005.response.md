To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. The variable `s` is an integer that can range from 0 to 99.
2. The expression `n // 10` indicates that `n` should be defined or previously set, but since `n` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, we cannot determine its value directly from `s`.
3. However, since the code is returning `tens[n // 10]`, it suggests that the intention is to convert the tens place of a number into its corresponding word representation.

Since we lack the definition or value of `n`, we cannot specify what `n // 10` evaluates to. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the fact that we are returning a value from the `tens` list based on a calculation involving an undefined variable `n`.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; returning tens[n // 10] based on an undefined n**
