The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones`. If `s` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from `tens`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string representation of `s` in the format `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`. If `s` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not execute the if block and thus does not return a value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` within the specified range and return its English representation based on various conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, returns the corresponding string from ones if s is between 0 and 9, returns the corresponding string from teens if s is between 11 and 19, returns the corresponding string from tens if s is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, and returns a combined string representation of tens and ones if s is not a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99. If s is less than 0 or greater than 99, it does not return a value.**
