Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function prints the corresponding string from the `ones` array. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the function prints the corresponding string from the `teens` array based on the value of `s`. If `s` is 20 or greater and less than 100, the function prints the English representation of `s` by combining the appropriate word from the `tens` array with the word from the `ones` array, separated by a hyphen if necessary. The function does not handle values of `s` below 0 or above 99, which may lead to `IndexError` or undesired outputs.***
