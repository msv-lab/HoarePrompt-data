Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 20, the function prints the corresponding English word from the `teens` array based on the value of `s`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the function prints the English representation of `s` by combining the appropriate word from the `tens` array with the word from the `ones` array, separated by a hyphen if necessary. The function does not handle values of `s` below 0 or above 99, which may lead to index errors or undesired outputs.***
