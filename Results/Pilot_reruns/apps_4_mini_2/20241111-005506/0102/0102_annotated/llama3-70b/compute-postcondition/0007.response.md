Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation of `s` in English, formatted as 'tens' followed by 'ones' with a hyphen if the ones place is not zero.***
