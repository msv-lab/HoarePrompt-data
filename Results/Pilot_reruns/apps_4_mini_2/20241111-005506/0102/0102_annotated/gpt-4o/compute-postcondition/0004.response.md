The function returns `teens[n - 10]`. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 99\), we need to ensure that `n` is at least 10 for `n - 10` to be a valid index for the `teens` list. The `teens` list includes values for numbers from 11 to 19, corresponding to indices 1 to 9. Therefore, if `n` is in the range of 10 to 19, the function will return values from `teens`.

Assuming that `n` is between 10 and 19, the output will be one of the values from the `teens` list. If `n` is less than 10, the return statement will not be valid, but the question constrains `n` to allow this operation under the assumption it is being called correctly when `n` is valid.

For valid values of `n` (10 through 19):
- `n = 10` returns `teens[0]` which is an empty string.
- `n = 11` returns `teens[1]` which is 'eleven'.
- `n = 12` returns `teens[2]` which is 'twelve'.
- `n = 13` returns `teens[3]` which is 'thirteen'.
- `n = 14` returns `teens[4]` which is 'fourteen'.
- `n = 15` returns `teens[5]` which is 'fifteen'.
- `n = 16` returns `teens[6]` which is 'sixteen'.
- `n = 17` returns `teens[7]` which is 'seventeen'.
- `n = 18` returns `teens[8]` which is 'eighteen'.
- `n = 19` returns `teens[9]` which is 'nineteen'.

Thus, the output state should reflect that `n` is within the valid range and that a value from the `teens` array is being returned.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 19; the function returns a value from the `teens` list corresponding to `n - 10`.**
