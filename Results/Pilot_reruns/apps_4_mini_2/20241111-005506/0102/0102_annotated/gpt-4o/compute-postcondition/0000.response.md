The code initializes a list named `ones` that contains the string representations of the numbers from 0 to 9. The value of `n` is not directly affected by this line of code, and it remains an integer within the specified range. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `n` along with the newly created list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99; `ones` is ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']**
