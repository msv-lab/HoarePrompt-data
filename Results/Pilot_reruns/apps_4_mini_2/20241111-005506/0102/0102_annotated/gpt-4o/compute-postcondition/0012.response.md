Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` in the range of 0 to 99 and returns its English word representation. For values 0 to 9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list. For values between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For multiples of 10 between 10 and 90, it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list. For other values from 10 to 99, it concatenates the word for the tens place and the word for the ones place, separated by a hyphen. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case for 10 or 20, which return 'ten' and 'twenty' respectively, but they fall under the multiples of ten condition. It handles `n` being 0 correctly by returning 'zero'.**
