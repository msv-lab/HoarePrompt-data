To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Specification:** 
   - The first line contains integers `n` (number of bus routes) and `t` (time Serval goes to the station).
   - The next `n` lines contain pairs of integers `s_i` (first bus time for route i) and `d_i` (interval between buses for route i).

2. **Desired Output:** 
   - We need to find which bus route Serval will use based on the earliest bus that arrives at or after time `t`.

### Key Points of the Implementation:
- The program checks each bus route to find the first bus that Serval can catch:
  - If the first bus (`s_i`) arrives after `t`, it calculates the wait time as `s_i - t`.
  - If Serval arrives exactly when a bus arrives (`(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), then the wait time is `0`.
  - If Serval arrives when no bus is currently there, it calculates when the next bus will arrive using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

- It keeps track of the minimum wait time and the corresponding bus route index.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Case Handling:** 
   - The program does not consider the scenario where `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not `0`. This could lead to an incorrect calculation of wait times.
   - If there are multiple buses arriving at the same earliest time, the program does not specify which one to choose, but allows for any valid route.

### Testing for Correctness:
Let's consider a test case:
- **Case:** 
  ```
  Input:
  1 10
  5 5
  ```
  - Here, `s_1 = 5` and `d_1 = 5`. The buses arrive at `5, 10, 15, ...`.
  - Serval arrives at `10`, which matches exactly with the second bus.
  - The expected output should be `1` (the first route).

- **Another Case:**
  ```
  Input:
  2 3
  1 2
  2 1
  ```
  - Here, `s_1 = 1, d_1 = 2` (buses at `1, 3, 5...`) and `s_2 = 2, d_2 = 1` (buses at `2, 3, 4...`).
  - Serval arrives at `3`, and both the first and second routes have a bus at `3`.
  - The output can be either `1` or `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the bus route Serval will take based on the rules provided, and all edge cases seem to be handled correctly. 

Therefore, after analyzing the code and considering various test cases:

Correctness: **True**
