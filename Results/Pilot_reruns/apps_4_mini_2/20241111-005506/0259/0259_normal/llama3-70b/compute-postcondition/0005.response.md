According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as the iteration variable (in this case, an underscore `_`, which is commonly used when the variable is not needed) is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. For the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `_` must be less than `n`. If the loop has executed `k` times, then for it to execute again, `k` must be less than `n`.

Assuming that the loop has executed `k` times, then at the end of the last iteration, the state of `_` is `k`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `k` is less than `n`. 

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we need to represent the state by updating `n` to be greater than `k`. If `k` is equal to `n - 1`, then we can set `n` to be at least `n` (the original value) and update the iteration count accordingly.

Thus, the necessary adjustments will be:
- `n` should remain the same at the end of the last iteration, as it is still a valid range.
- `_` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the next potential iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing the tuple (s, d), `_` is the current iteration count, which should be incremented by 1 (next iteration)**
