The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ans`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, as the other variables (`buses` and `min_time`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers; `min_time` is set to float('inf'); `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers; `min_time` is set to float('inf'); `ans` is -1**
