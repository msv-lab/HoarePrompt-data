Output State: **If `buses` is a list containing at least one tuple of integers, then after the loop executes, `min_time` will contain the minimum value of `(t - s) % d` for the optimal bus, and `ans` will be the index (1-based) of that bus in the list. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains float('inf') and `ans` remains -1.**
