The code `buses.append((s, d))` adds a new tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The variables `s` and `d` are inputs converted to integers. The initial state indicates that `buses` already contains all previous tuples.

Since the exact previous contents of `buses` are not specified, we assume it contains tuples from prior operations. The new tuple `(s, d)` will be added to this list.

The output state reflects that `buses` has been updated to include the new tuple while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is `n - 1`, and `buses` contains all previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d)**
