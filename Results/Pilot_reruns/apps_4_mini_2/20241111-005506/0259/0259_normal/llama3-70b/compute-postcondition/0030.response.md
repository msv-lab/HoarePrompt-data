According to the code, the loop execution depends on the `buses` list and the index `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are tuples in the `buses` list, and the index `i` will increment with each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple. Since `i` is the index of the current tuple being processed, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `buses`. 

If `buses` has at least 1 tuple, and since `i` is currently processing the first tuple (index 0), for the loop to execute again, `i` should be 1, and the next tuple `(s, d)` should be the second tuple in the `buses` list.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next index and the next tuple being processed.

State: **`buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, s is the second element in the second tuple, d is the second element in the second tuple, i is 1**
