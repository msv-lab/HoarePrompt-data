The variable `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`. The previous state indicates that `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `s` and `d` are the values of the next tuple in `buses`. The state of other variables (`buses`, `i`, `s`, `d`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple; `i` is equal to the length of `buses` - 1; `s` and `d` are the values of the next tuple in `buses`; `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d; `min_time` is equal to `time`.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple; `i` is equal to the length of `buses` - 1; `s` and `d` are the values of the next tuple in `buses`; `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d; `min_time` is equal to `time`**.
