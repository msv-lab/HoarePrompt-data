The values of `n` and `t` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` accepts two integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them into integers. The previous state of `n` and `t` is replaced by the newly input values, but the specific input values are unknown. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the change in `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000**
