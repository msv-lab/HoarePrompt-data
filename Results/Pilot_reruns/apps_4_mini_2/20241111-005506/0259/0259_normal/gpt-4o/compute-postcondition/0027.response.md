Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `i` is incremented by 1; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`. If the time `t` minus the start time `s_i` is perfectly divisible by the duration `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is non-negative and reflects the necessary waiting time for the next bus.***
