Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than `i`; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; if `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus is arriving exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`.***
