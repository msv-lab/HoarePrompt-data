The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
- `t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 100000 \).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers \( (s_i, d_i) \) such that \( 1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000 \).

After executing the function body, it evaluates all available bus routes and calculates the minimum wait time for the buses. It then identifies the route that corresponds to this minimum wait time. The function ultimately returns `chosen_route`, which indicates the route that provides the minimum wait time.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), t (a positive integer), and bus_routes (a list of tuples of positive integers), and returns the bus route that provides the minimum wait time after evaluating all available routes.**
