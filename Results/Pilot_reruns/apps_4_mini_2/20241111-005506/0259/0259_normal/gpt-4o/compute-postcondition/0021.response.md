Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than `i`; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This ensures that `min_wait_time` holds the smallest wait time encountered so far, and `chosen_route` identifies the corresponding bus route. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`. All scenarios regarding the calculation of `wait_time` based on the relationship between `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i` are accounted for, ensuring that the program correctly identifies the optimal bus route based on the wait times.***
