Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `wait_time` is computed based on the relationship between `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This covers all scenarios where the bus departure time is either after `t`, exactly at `t`, or when the next bus arrives, ensuring that the optimal route based on the minimum wait time is selected. If no updates occur (i.e., `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`), the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
