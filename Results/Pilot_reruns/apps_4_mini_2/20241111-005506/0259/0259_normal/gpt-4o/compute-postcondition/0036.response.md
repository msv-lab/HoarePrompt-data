Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of `bus_routes` where each route is defined by a start time `s_i` and a duration `d_i`. It calculates the minimum wait time for the buses based on these routes and returns the 1-based index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time. If no bus routes are available or if `n` is 0, it returns -1, indicating that no route was evaluated. **
