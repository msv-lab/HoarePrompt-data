The value of `wait_time` is assigned the result of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is the first element of the tuple retrieved from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, the value of `wait_time` will depend on both `s_i` and `t`. Since `s_i` could be any positive integer based on the bus route selected, the specific value of `wait_time` will vary accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than `i`; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `wait_time` is `s_i - t` where `s_i` is derived from `bus_routes[i]`.**
