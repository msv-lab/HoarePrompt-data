The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0, but no other variables are affected by this assignment. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial values of the other variables as well.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than `i`; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`; `wait_time` is 0**
