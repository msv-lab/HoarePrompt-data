The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, so the output state reflects that `chosen_route` is dependent on `i`. The variable `min_wait_time` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
