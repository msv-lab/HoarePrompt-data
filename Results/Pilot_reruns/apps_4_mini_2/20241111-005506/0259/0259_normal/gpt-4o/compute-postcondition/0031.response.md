Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; after evaluating the wait time, if the calculated `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. The calculation of `wait_time` takes into account all edge cases, including when `s_i` is exactly equal to `t`, ensuring it is always non-negative.***
