The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is taken from the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`, and `t` is a positive integer that is already defined within the provided bounds. 

Since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` must have been incremented and is less than `n`. Therefore, `s_i` can be considered, but the exact value of `s_i` and `t` are not specified in the initial state. 

The calculation of `wait_time` will depend on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. Thus, we can say that `wait_time` is a value that results from the calculation of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is an element from `bus_routes` and `t` is a defined integer.

Since we cannot determine exact numerical values for `wait_time` due to the undefined specifics of `s_i` and `t`, we state the relationship instead.

Output State: **`wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is a defined positive integer.**
