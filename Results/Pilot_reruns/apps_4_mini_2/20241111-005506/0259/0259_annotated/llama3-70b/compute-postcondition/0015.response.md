According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. For the loop to execute, `buses` must contain at least one tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `min_time` is set to infinity and `ans` is -1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `buses` must contain at least one tuple, and the index `i` should start at 0 with the first tuple `(s, d)` being the first bus in the list.

State: **`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`**
