Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 2 tuples, `i` is 2, `s` is the start of the third bus, `d` is the duration of the third bus, and `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 3; otherwise, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
