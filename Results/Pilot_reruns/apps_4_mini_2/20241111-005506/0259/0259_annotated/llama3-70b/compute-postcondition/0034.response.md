Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for two integers, `n` (the number of buses) and `t` (a time value), then collects `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` representing the start time and duration of each bus. It calculates the minimum waiting time for the buses at time `t` and prints the 1-based index of the bus that has the minimum waiting time. If there are no buses (`n` is 0), it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
