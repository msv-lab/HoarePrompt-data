Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to `2`. In all cases, `i` remains `1`, and `time` is updated to `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
