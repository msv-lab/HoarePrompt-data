The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state specifies that `buses` is an empty list, and the values of `s` and `d` are input integers. After executing the code, `buses` will contain one tuple with the values of `s` and `d`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
