The code `s, d = map(int, input().split())` assigns values to `s` and `d` by taking input from the user, splitting the input string into separate components, and converting those components into integers. The variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected by this operation, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `t`, and `buses`, while `s` and `d` will hold the values provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
