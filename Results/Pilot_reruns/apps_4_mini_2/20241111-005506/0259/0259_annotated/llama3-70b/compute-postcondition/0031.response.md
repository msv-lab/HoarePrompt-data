Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum value of `(t - s) % d` across all tuples in `buses`, or remains as infinity if `buses` is empty; `ans` is the 1-based index of the tuple that provided the minimum time, or remains -1 if `buses` is empty. If `buses` contains at least one tuple, the loop executes for each tuple, updating `min_time` and `ans` based on the condition. If `buses` is empty, the loop does not execute and `min_time` remains infinity and `ans` remains -1.**
