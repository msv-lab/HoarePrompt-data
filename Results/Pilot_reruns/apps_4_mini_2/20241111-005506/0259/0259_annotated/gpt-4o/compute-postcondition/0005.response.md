The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is set to infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is 0**.
