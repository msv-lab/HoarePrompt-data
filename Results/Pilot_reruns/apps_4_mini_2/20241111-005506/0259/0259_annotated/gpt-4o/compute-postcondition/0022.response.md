According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current index of the loop, which is `n - 1` (the last index), meaning it has executed `n` times already. 

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is possible since `i` can take values from `0` to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `n`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` remain unchanged based on the information provided.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`); `i` is `n`**
