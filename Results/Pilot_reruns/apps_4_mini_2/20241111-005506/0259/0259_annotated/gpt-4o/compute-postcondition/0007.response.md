Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`) such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is set to infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, and `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus is available immediately. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which gives the time to wait for the next bus, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative integer corresponding to the wait time until the next bus arrives.***
