The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unknown based on the initial state information provided. Therefore, after execution, `chosen_route` will be `i + 1`, but we do not know the specific value of `i`. The output state reflects the assignment that was made.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
