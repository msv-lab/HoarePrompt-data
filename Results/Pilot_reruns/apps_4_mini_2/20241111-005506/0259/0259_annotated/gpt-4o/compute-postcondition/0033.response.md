Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated based on the bus routes evaluated, `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is at least 1, then `min_wait_time` reflects the shortest wait time across all evaluated routes, considering cases where the bus arrives before, exactly at, or after `t`, and ensuring that all conditions for calculating `wait_time` are handled correctly.**
