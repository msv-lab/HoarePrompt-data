Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`). If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. If the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating the bus is at the stop when `t` is checked. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring it is a non-negative integer representing the time until the next bus arrives after `t` has been checked. This encompasses all scenarios for calculating `wait_time` based on the values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.***
