Postcondition: ***`s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. If the difference `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative value less than `d_i`.***
