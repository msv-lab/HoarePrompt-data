The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. However, the value of `wait_time` is not provided in the initial state, as it depends on the values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`, which influence its calculation based on the described conditions. Since the value of `wait_time` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, which is dependent on the conditions involving `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.**
