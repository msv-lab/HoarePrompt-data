Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains the start time `s_i` and the interval `d_i` for each bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the buses based on their schedules and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that has the shortest wait time. If no bus routes are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it returns -1, indicating that no route was evaluated. The function handles the cases where the bus arrives before, exactly at, or after the current time `t`. **
