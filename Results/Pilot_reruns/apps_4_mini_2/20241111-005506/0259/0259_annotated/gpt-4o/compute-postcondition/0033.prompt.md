You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the for loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see examples of the loop executing several times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after the execution of the for loop. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i
```
Output state after the loop executes 1 times:  `factorial` is `1`, 'i' is 1 , n is at least 1.
Output state after the loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is 2, 'i' is 2 , n is at least 2.
Output state after the loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is 6 , 'i' is 3 , n is at least 3.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
If n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and i will be n. If n is 0 or lower then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
Output State: **`if n is at least 1 then factorial` is the factorial of `n`. if i is lower than 1 the loop doesnt execute and factorial is 1**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0,'students_num' is 0, students is a list of students.
Code of the loop:
```
for student in students:
    total += student
    students_num += 1
```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `total` is equal to the first student, 'students_num' is 1, students is a list with at least one student, student is the first student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student, 'students_num' is 2, students is a list with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student plus the third student, 'students_num' is 3, students is a list with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list.


Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of a list students and stores it in total and the number of students in students_num. The loop will be executed at least once if students is a list with at least one student. If the list is empty the loop does not execute and total and students_num are 0.
Output State: **total is equal to the sum of all students, students_num is the number of students, students is a list of students.**
Your Task:

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is set to infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(n):
    s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
    if s_i >= t:
        wait_time = s_i - t
    elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
        wait_time = 0
    else:
        wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
    if wait_time < min_wait_time:
        min_wait_time = wait_time
        chosen_route = i + 1

```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`), and `wait_time` is calculated as described. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This accounts for all cases including when the bus arrives before, exactly at, or after `t`, as well as when `s_i` equals `t` or when `t` is just after `s_i`, ensuring that the waiting time reflects the next available bus based on the given bus routes.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`). If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that the chosen route corresponds to the minimum wait time among the evaluated bus routes.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`s_i` and `d_i` are values from `bus_routes[n]`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This ensures that `min_wait_time` retains its previous value if `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, correctly reflecting the minimum wait time encountered so far. Additionally, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions defined, ensuring that it is a non-negative value less than `d_i`, thus accounting for all edge cases regarding the relationship between `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`.


Now, please think step by step. Use the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example to help you, but mostly focus on the loop code to  determine the loop's output state. Try to understand what the loops functionality is and what will be the values of the variables after it executes. Are there cases where the loop wont execute?
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. As the output state have a summary of what the loop does what are the values of the variables after the loop executes as well as the cases where the loop does not execute and the values of the variables in those cases.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
