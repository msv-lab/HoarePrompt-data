Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`), and `wait_time` is calculated as described. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This accounts for all cases including when the bus arrives before, exactly at, or after `t`, as well as when `s_i` equals `t` or when `t` is just after `s_i`, ensuring that the waiting time reflects the next available bus based on the given bus routes.***
