Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `posn = a.index(n)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a` to the variable `posn`.

Since `n` is an input integer, its value is not fixed. However, we know that `a` is a list of input integers and `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`.

After executing the code, `posn` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`. If `n` is not found in `a`, the code will raise a `ValueError`. However, since we are only asked to provide the output state, we will assume that `n` is found in `a`.

The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, and `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, and `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
