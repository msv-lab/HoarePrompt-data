The code `pos1 = a.index(1)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of the value 1 in the list `a` to the variable `pos1`. The value of `n` is not affected by this statement. The list `a` is also not modified, but its contents are used to determine the value of `pos1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`**
