To solve this task, we need to analyze the given Python code and the initial state of the variables.


The initial state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.


Now, let's analyze the code:


`n = int(input())`


This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` is overwritten by this new value.


However, the initial state of `a` is not affected by this line of code, as it is a separate variable that is not referenced or modified in the code.


Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.


Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
