To calculate the `max_distance`, we need to consider the values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. Since the values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are already calculated in the initial state, we can directly compare them to find the maximum value.

The value of `max_distance` will be the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. 

The values of other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is either `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`, `dist3` is the absolute value of `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute value of `n - 1 - min_pos`, and `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.**
