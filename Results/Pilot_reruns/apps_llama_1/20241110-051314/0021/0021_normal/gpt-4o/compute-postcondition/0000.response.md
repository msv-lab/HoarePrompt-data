The code `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n`, which is the integer input by the user. This new value of `n` overwrites the initial value of `n`. The initial state of `a` is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to the original value of `n`**
