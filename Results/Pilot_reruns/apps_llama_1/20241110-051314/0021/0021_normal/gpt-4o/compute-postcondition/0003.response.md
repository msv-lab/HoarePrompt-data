To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State**: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, and `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`.

2. **Code Impact**: The code `max_pos = a.index(n)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a` to the variable `max_pos`.

3. **Affected Variables**: The variable `max_pos` is introduced and assigned a value based on `n` and `a`.

4. **Calculating Result**: Since `n` is an input integer and `a` is a list of input integers, the value of `max_pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`. The value of `min_pos` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.

5. **Output State**: Considering the initial state and the impact of the code, the output state is as follows: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
