Based on the provided code and return postconditions, I will analyze the function and provide a concise summary of its functionality.

The function `func` appears to accept no parameters, but based on the annotations, it seems to expect two inputs: an integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `a` from 1 to `n`. However, since the function definition does not include these parameters, I will assume that the function is designed to take input from the user.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the function:

1. The function takes an integer input `n` from the user.
2. It then takes a list of integers `a` as input from the user.
3. The function finds the index of the first occurrence of 1 and `n` in the list `a`, storing them in `min_pos` and `max_pos`, respectively.
4. It calculates four distances: `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, which represent the absolute differences between the indices of 1 and `n` and the start and end of the list.
5. The function then finds the maximum of these four distances, `max_distance`.
6. Finally, the function prints the `max_distance`.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The function does not handle cases where the input list `a` does not contain 1 or `n`.
* The function does not handle cases where the input list `a` is empty.
* The function does not handle cases where the input integer `n` is less than 2.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function takes an integer input `n` and a list of integers `a` as input from the user, calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n` in the list, and prints the result. However, it does not handle cases where the input list is empty or does not contain 1 or `n`, and it does not handle cases where the input integer `n` is less than 2. **
