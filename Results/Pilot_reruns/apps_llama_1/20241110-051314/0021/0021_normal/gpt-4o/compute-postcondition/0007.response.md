Let's analyze the given code snippet.


The code snippet is: `dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`


`dist4` is assigned the absolute value of the difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.


Since `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, it is an integer value. Similarly, `n` is also an integer value.


Therefore, the value of `dist4` will be the absolute value of the difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`. This can be either `n - 1 - min_pos` or `min_pos - (n - 1)`, depending on whether `n - 1` is greater than or less than `min_pos`.


The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is either `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`, `dist3` is the absolute value of `min_pos`, and `dist4` is the absolute value of `n - 1 - min_pos`.


Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is either `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`, `dist3` is the absolute value of `min_pos`, and `dist4` is the absolute value of `n - 1 - min_pos`.**
