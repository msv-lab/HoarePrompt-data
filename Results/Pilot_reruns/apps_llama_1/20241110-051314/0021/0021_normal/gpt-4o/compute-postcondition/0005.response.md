To determine the output state, we need to calculate the value of `dist2`.

`dist2` is assigned the value `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. We know that `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`.

Since `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, we can say that `max_pos` is either `dist1` or `-dist1`.

Now, let's calculate the value of `dist2`:

`dist2` = `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`
= `abs(n - 1 - (dist1 or -dist1))`
= `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`

Since `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, we can say that `dist2` is either `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`.

The values of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, and `dist1` are not changed by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, and `dist2` is either `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, and `dist2` is either `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`**
