It seems like there's a mistake in the task description. The function definition is `def func():`, which means it doesn't accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `n` and `a`. I'll assume the correct function definition is `def func(n, a):`.

The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `a` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

However, the output is not provided. Please provide the output description, and I'll be happy to help you describe the functionality of the function.
