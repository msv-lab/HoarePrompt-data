Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program only considers the distances from the minimum and maximum elements to the edges of the array, but it does not consider the possibility of swapping the minimum and maximum elements with other elements in the array to maximize the distance.

For example, consider the input:

```
4
2 1 4 3
```

In this case, the program will output `3`, but the correct answer is `4`, which can be achieved by swapping the elements at positions 1 and 3. The program does not consider this possibility because it only looks at the distances from the minimum and maximum elements to the edges of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible swaps of the minimum and maximum elements with other elements in the array and calculate the maximum distance that can be achieved.
