The code `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n`, which is the integer converted from the user's input. This new value of `n` does not depend on the previous value of `n`, so the initial state of `n` being an integer greater than or equal to 2 is overridden. The list `a` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to the original value of `n`**
