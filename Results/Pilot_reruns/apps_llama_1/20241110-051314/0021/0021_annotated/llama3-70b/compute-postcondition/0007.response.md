Based on the provided information, I will describe the functionality of the function.


The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. 


However, since the output is not provided, I will wait for the output information to complete the functionality description.


Please provide the output information to proceed.
