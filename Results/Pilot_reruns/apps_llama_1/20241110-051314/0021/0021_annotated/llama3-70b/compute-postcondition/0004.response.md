`max_dist` is assigned the value of the maximum between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The value of `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`, the value of `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of the number `n` in the list `a`, and the value of `n` is an input integer. 

Since the values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are not known, we cannot directly calculate the value of `max_dist`. However, we can express the output state based on the given information.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from a new input, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of the number `n` in the list `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.**
