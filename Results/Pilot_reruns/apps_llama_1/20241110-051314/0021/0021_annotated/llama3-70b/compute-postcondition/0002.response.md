To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers from a new input

The code is:
```python
pos1 = a.index(1)
```

This line of code finds the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `pos1`.

Since `a` is a list of integers and we are finding the index of the number 1, we can assume that the number 1 exists in the list `a`. If it didn't, the code would raise a `ValueError`.

The output state is:
- `n` is still an input integer (its value doesn't change)
- `a` is still a list of integers from a new input (its value doesn't change)
- `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from a new input, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`**
