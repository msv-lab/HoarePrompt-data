To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

The code snippet is: `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))`

From the initial state, we know that:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers from a new input
- `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`
- `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of the number `n` in the list `a`
- `max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`
- `min_dist` is the minimum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`

The code snippet calculates the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`, and then prints the result.

Since the `print` statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the calculated value is printed.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers from a new input
- `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`
- `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of the number `n` in the list `a`
- `max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`
- `min_dist` is the minimum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`
- The function prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from a new input, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of the number `n` in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`, `min_dist` is the minimum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`, and the function prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.**
