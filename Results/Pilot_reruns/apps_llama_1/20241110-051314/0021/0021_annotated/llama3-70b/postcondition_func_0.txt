The function takes two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It calculates the indices of the first occurrences of 1 and `n` in the list `a`, and then calculates the maximum and minimum distances between these indices. The function then prints the maximum of the maximum distance and `n - 1 - min_dist`, but may produce incorrect or undefined results if the input `n` is not an integer greater than or equal to 2, or if the input list `a` does not meet the expected constraints.
