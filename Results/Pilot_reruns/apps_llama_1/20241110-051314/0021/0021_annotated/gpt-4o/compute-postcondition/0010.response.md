It seems like there is a mistake in your prompt. The function definition is provided as `def func():`, which does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `n` and `a`. I will assume the correct function definition is `def func(n, a):`.

Here's the description of the functionality:

The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. However, the output of the function is not provided. Therefore, I will leave the return value description empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The return value is not specified.**
