To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`
- `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`
- `dist3` is `min_pos`
- `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`

The given code is:
```python
max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
```

The impact of the code on the program is that it calculates the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, and assigns it to the variable `max_distance`. 

Since the values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are already calculated in the initial state, we can directly calculate `max_distance` using these values.

However, without knowing the specific values of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, we cannot determine the exact value of `max_distance`. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`
- `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`
- `dist3` is `min_pos`
- `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`
- `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, `dist3` is `min_pos`, `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`, and `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`**
