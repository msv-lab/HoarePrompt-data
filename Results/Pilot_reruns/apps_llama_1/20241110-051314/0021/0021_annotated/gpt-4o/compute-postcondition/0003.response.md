The code `max_pos = a.index(n)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a` to the variable `max_pos`. 

The value of `n` is an input integer, and the list `a` contains input integers. The variable `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, but this information is not directly relevant to the assignment of `max_pos`.

After the execution of the code, the variable `max_pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`. The values of `n` and `a` are not changed, and `min_pos` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
