The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, and `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).

However, you haven't provided the output or any cases for the function. Please provide the output or cases so I can complete the functionality description.

Once you provide the output or cases, I'll be able to describe the return value of the function based on the input parameters.
