To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. 

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2. Since `N` is already at least 2, it does not need to be adjusted further to ensure the loop can execute again.

However, since `i` is being used as an index (starting from 1) and is now incremented to 2, it implies that the list `A` must have at least 3 elements for `i` to be a valid index in the next iteration. Therefore, the state of `A` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it has at least 3 elements.

Additionally, since `gcd` is the gcd of the first two elements of `A`, and `i` is moving to the next element, `gcd` should be updated to reflect its relation with the next element in the list. However, without the specifics of how `gcd` is updated in the loop body, we cannot accurately define its new state. For the purpose of this exercise, we will focus on the states directly influenced by the loop condition.

State: **`N` is at least 2, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least 3 elements, `gcd` is updated based on its previous value and the next element in `A`, `i` is 2**
