The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `A`. The values of `N`, `K`, and the rest of the list `A` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a list of input integers, and `gcd` is the first element of `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a list of input integers, and `gcd` is the first element of `A`.**
