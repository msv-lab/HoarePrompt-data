Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements, `K` is an input integer, `N` is at least 1, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 4. If `i` squared is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `gcd` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
