According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `N` is at least 2. `N` being at least 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is at least 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is at least 3, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least 3 elements, `gcd` is updated based on its previous value and `A[2]`, `i` is 2**
