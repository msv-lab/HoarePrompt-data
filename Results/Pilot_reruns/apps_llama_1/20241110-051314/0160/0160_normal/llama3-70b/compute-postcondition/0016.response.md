Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `K` is an input integer, and `max_divisor` is either the greatest common divisor of the first `N` integers in the list `A` or the first integer in the list `A`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value, `i`, and `gcd` divided by `i` if `i` squared is not equal to `gcd`; otherwise, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
