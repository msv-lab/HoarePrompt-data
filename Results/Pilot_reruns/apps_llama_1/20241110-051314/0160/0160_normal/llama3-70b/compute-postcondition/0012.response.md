To ensure the loop executes, we need to analyze the conditions that must be met before the loop starts. The loop iterates from 1 to the square root of `gcd` (inclusive), so we need to ensure that `gcd` is at least 1 to have a valid range.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the square root of `gcd` is at least 1, meaning `gcd` must be at least 1. 

Since `gcd` is either the greatest common divisor of the first `N` integers in the list `A` or the first integer in the list `A`, we can infer that `N` must be at least 1, and `A` must have at least one integer.

Additionally, `i` is either `N-1` or 0, but since the loop iterates from 1, we can set `i` to 1.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `K` is an input integer, and `max_divisor` is either the greatest common divisor of the first `N` integers in the list `A` or the first integer in the list `A`.**
