Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `gcd` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `A` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `K` is an input integer, and `max_divisor` is either the greatest common divisor of the first `N` integers in the list `A` or the first integer in the list `A`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`, and if `i` squared is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to be the maximum of its new value and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
