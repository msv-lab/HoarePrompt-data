To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `N` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a new list of integers

Given Code:
```python
gcd = A[0]
```

Impact of the code: The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `A`.

Previous values of affected variables: `A` is a new list of integers, but its elements are not specified. However, since `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, we know that `gcd` will take the value of the first integer in the list `A`.

Calculation of the result: Since the specific elements of `A` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `gcd`. However, we can conclude that `gcd` will be equal to the first integer in the list `A`.

Output State: `N` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a new list of integers, and `gcd` is the first integer in the list `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a new list of integers, and `gcd` is the first integer in the list `A`.**
