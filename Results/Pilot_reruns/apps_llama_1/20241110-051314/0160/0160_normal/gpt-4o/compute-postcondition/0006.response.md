The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The initial state of `i` is 2, so 2 is added to the set `divisors`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, x is an integer such that x >= 1, i is 2, divisors is a set that contains 1, 2, and/or x, and 2 is added to the set divisors.**
