Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, x is an integer such that x >= 1, i is 1. If x is divisible by i, divisors is a set containing 1 and x, otherwise divisors remains an empty set.***
