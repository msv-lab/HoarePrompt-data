To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9
- `A` is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i
- `x` is an integer such that x >= 9
- `i` is 3
- `divisors` is a set that contains 1, 2, 3, x, x // 2, and/or x // i if x is even, otherwise divisors remains unchanged

The code snippet is:
```python
divisors.add(x // i)
```

Since `i` is 3, we need to check if `x` is divisible by 3. Given that `x` is an integer such that x >= 9, it is possible for `x` to be divisible by 3.

If `x` is divisible by 3, then `x // i` (which is `x // 3`) will be an integer and will be added to the `divisors` set.

The states of `N`, `K`, `A`, `x`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. The only change is in the `divisors` set.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9
- `A` is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i
- `x` is an integer such that x >= 9
- `i` is 3
- `divisors` is a set that contains 1, 2, 3, x, x // 2, x // 3 (if x is divisible by 3)

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, `x` is an integer such that x >= 9, `i` is 3, and `divisors` is a set that contains 1, 2, 3, x, x // 2, and x // 3 (if x is divisible by 3)**
