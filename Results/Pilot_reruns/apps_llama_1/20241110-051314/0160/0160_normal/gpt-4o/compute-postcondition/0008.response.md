Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, x is an integer such that x >= 1, i is 2, and divisors is a set that contains 1, 2, x, x // 2, and/or x // i if x is even, otherwise divisors remains unchanged***
