The given code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` accepts two space-separated integer inputs and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. However, the initial state already provides the values of `n` and `k`. 

The new values of `n` and `k` will overwrite the initial values. The new values of `n` and `k` will be the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
