Based on the provided information, here is the description of the function's functionality:


The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer, where 1 <= n <= 10^9 and 0 <= k <= 8. However, since the function definition is `def func():`, it does not accept any parameters. Therefore, the description should be adjusted accordingly.


Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
