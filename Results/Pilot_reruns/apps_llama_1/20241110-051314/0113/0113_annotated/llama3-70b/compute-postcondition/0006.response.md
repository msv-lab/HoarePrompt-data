The value of `n` is incremented by 1, and `n` is an input integer plus 2, so the new value of `n` is an input integer plus 3. The values of `k` and `x` are not affected, so `k` remains an input integer, and `x` remains 10 raised to the power of `k`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer plus 3, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.**
