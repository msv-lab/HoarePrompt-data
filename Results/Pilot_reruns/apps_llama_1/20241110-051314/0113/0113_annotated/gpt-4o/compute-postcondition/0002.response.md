The function returns `x`, and `x` is `n` multiplied by a power of 10. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and the power of 10 is determined by `multiplier`, which can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 8, `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, `x` is `n` multiplied by a power of 10, and the function returns `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 8, `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, `x` is `n` multiplied by a power of 10, and the function returns `x`**
