The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the product of `n` and a power of 10 determined by `k`, and returns the result. If `k` is greater than 8, the function still calculates the result correctly. If `n` is not a positive integer or `k` is not a non-negative integer, the function may raise a `ValueError` or produce incorrect results.
