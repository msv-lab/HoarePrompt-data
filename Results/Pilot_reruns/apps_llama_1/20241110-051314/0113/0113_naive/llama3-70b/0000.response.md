Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 123456789 and k = 8, the program will enter an infinite loop because n will never be divisible by 10^8. This is because n is not a multiple of 2^8 or 5^8, which are the prime factors of 10^8.

A correct solution would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of n and 10^k, which can be done using the formula lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b), where gcd is the greatest common divisor. Here is an example of a correct solution:

```python
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
x = 10 ** k
lcm = abs(n*x) // math.gcd(n, x)
print(lcm)
```

This solution correctly calculates the k-rounding of n for all cases.
