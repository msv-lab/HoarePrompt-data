The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is an input integer + 2, so the new value of `n` is (an input integer + 2) + 1, which simplifies to an input integer + 3. The values of `k` and `x` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer + 3, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 10 raised to the power of an input integer**
