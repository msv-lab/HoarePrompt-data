The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the input. The `input()` function accepts a string input, and the `split()` function splits the input into two parts. The `map(int,...)` function converts these two parts into integers. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 8 in the initial state, these constraints are no longer valid after the execution of the code because `n` and `k` are reassigned new values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
