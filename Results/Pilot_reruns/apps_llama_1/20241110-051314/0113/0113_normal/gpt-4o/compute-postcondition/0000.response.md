The code `multiplier = 10 ** k` assigns the value of `10` raised to the power of `k` to the variable `multiplier`. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8.

The possible values of `10 ** k` are:
- `10 ** 0` = 1
- `10 ** 1` = 10
- `10 ** 2` = 100
- `10 ** 3` = 1000
- `10 ** 4` = 10000
- `10 ** 5` = 100000
- `10 ** 6` = 1000000
- `10 ** 7` = 10000000
- `10 ** 8` = 100000000

Since `n` is a positive integer and its value is not affected by the code, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, and `multiplier` is a power of 10 between 1 and 100000000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, and `multiplier` is a power of 10 between 1 and 100000000**
