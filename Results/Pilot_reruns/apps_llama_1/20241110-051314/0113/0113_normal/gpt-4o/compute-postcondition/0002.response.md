The function returns `x`, and `x` is a multiple of `n`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `multiplier` is a power of 10 between 1 and 100000000, `x` is a multiple of `n`, and the function returns a multiple of `n`.
