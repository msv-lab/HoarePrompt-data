Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples. If `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to the current route index plus one. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`.***
