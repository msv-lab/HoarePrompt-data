`s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the `i-th` tuple in `bus_routes`. Given that `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the second tuple in `bus_routes`. However, since the initial state already states that `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes` and `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, the values of `s_i` and `d_i` do not change.

The output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes**
