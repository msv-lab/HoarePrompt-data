`chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`, and `i` is 0, so `chosen_route` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`.**
