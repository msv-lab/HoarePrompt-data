`wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, and `t` is a positive integer. Since `s_i` is a specific value (the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`), we use that specific value directly for calculations. The value of `wait_time` is the difference between `s_i` and `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.**
