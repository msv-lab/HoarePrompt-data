`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` depends on the values of `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. 

Since `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes` and `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, and `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` have specific values. However, the exact values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not provided. 

The value of `wait_time` can be `s_i - t`, 0, or `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` based on the conditions provided. Since `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i` have specific values, `wait_time` also has a specific value. 

`min_wait_time` is assigned this specific value of `wait_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is the previously calculated value, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is the previously calculated value, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time**
