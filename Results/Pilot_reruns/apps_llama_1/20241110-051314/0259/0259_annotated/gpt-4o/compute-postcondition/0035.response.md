The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, and `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers.

After executing the function body, if `n` is greater than 0, the function returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time. Otherwise, it returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of `n` tuples `bus_routes`, and return the index of the route with the minimum wait time if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise return -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a positive integer t, and a list of n tuples bus_routes, and returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time if n is greater than 0, otherwise returns -1.**
