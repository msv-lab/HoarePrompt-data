Output State: **The loop calculates the minimum wait time for the next bus across all routes and stores it in `min_wait_time`, and the corresponding route index in `chosen_route`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes `n` times, and `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time across all routes, and `chosen_route` is the index of the route with the minimum wait time. `i` is `n-1` after the loop executes, `s_i` is the first element of the last tuple in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the last tuple in `bus_routes`.**
