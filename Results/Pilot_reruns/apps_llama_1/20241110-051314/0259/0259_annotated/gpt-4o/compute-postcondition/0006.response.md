To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
```
From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `t` is a positive integer
- `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples
- `min_wait_time` is positive infinity
- `chosen_route` is -1
- `i` is 0
- `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`
- `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`

Now, let's calculate the value of `wait_time`:
- `t - s_i` is the difference between the current time `t` and the start time `s_i` of the first bus route.
- `(t - s_i) % d_i` is the remainder of the division of the above difference by the duration `d_i` of the first bus route.
- `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` is the difference between the duration `d_i` and the remainder, which gives the waiting time `wait_time` for the first bus route.

The output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `t` is a positive integer
- `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples
- `min_wait_time` is positive infinity
- `chosen_route` is -1
- `i` is 0
- `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`
- `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`
- `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i**
