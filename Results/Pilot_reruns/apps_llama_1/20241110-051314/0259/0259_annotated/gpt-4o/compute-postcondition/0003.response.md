`s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`. The value of `i` is 0, so `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`.**
