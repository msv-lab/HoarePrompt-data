To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given code and state.

The loop is a simple `for` loop that iterates over the range of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. 

The other states (`t`, `bus_routes`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`) do not affect the loop's execution. They are used in the loop body, but their values do not determine whether the loop will execute again.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, which must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time` is the current minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is the current chosen route**
