The function returns `chosen_route`, and `chosen_route` is the index of the route with the minimum wait time if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise it is -1. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time across all routes if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise it is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is the index of the route with the minimum wait time if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise it is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `s_i` is the first element of the last tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the last tuple in `bus_routes`, and the function returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise it returns -1.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time across all routes if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise it is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is the index of the route with the minimum wait time if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise it is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `s_i` is the first element of the last tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the last tuple in `bus_routes`, and the function returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise it returns -1**
