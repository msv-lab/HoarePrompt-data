Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After executing the if statement, if `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 2. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
