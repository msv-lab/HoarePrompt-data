The values of `n` and `t` are overwritten by the result of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input()` accepts a string input and `split()` splits it into two parts, and `map(int,...)` converts these two parts into integers. The initial values of `n` and `t` are lost, and `n` and `t` now hold the two input integers. The state of `buses` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s and d**
