The code `ans = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ans`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`buses` is a list of `n` tuples, each containing two input integers `s` and `d`, `s` and `d` have the values of the last input integers from the last iteration of the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `min_time` is positive infinity, and `ans` is -1**
