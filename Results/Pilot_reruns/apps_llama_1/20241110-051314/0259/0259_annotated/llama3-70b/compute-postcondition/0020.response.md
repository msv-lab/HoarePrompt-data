To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is: `for (i, (s, d)) in enumerate(buses):`

This means that the loop will iterate over the `buses` list, and `i` will take on the index of each tuple in the list, while `(s, d)` will take on the values of each tuple.

The current state is:
- `buses` is a list of `n` tuples with `n` greater than 0
- `s` and `d` are the first pair of integers in the list
- `i` is 0
- `t` remains unchanged
- `min_time` is positive infinity
- `ans` is -1

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions need to be met:

- `buses` must have at least one more tuple after the current one.
- `i` must be incremented to point to the next tuple in the list.
- `(s, d)` must take on the values of the next tuple in the list.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `buses` remains a list of `n` tuples with `n` greater than 0 (no change needed)
- `s` and `d` must be updated to the next pair of integers in the list
- `i` must be incremented to 1

The other states (`t`, `min_time`, and `ans`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`buses` is a list of `n` tuples with `n` greater than 0, `s` and `d` are the second pair of integers in the list, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1**
