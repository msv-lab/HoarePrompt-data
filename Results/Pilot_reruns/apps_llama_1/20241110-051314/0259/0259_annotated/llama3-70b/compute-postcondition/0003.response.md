The code uses the `map` function to convert two input values to integers and assigns them to the variables `s` and `d`. The `input().split()` function accepts two space-separated input values.

The initial state is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list.

After execution, the variables `s` and `d` are assigned the values of the two input integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
