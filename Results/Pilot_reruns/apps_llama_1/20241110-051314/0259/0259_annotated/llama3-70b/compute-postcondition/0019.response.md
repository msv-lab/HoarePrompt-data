Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of `n` tuples with `n` greater than 0, `s` and `d` are the first pair of integers in the list, `i` is 0, `t` remains unchanged. If the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d` is less than the initial `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to this remainder and `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged, with `min_time` being positive infinity and `ans` being -1.***
