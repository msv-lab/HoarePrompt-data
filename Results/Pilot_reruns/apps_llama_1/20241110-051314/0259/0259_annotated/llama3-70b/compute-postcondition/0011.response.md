To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as the loop variable `_` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` should be less than `n`, which means `n` should be greater than the current value of `_`. Since `_` is not explicitly defined in the state, we can assume it's the loop counter, which increments by 1 in each iteration. 

So, if `n` is greater than 1, `_` is likely 1 at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` should be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing three tuples with input integers, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
