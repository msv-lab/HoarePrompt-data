To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `t` is an input integer
- `buses` is a list containing one tuple with input integers `s` and `d`
- `s` is a new input integer
- `d` is a new input integer

The code snippet is:
```python
buses.append((s, d))
```
This line of code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:
- `n` is greater than 1 (no change)
- `t` is an input integer (no change)
- `buses` is a list containing two tuples with input integers: the original tuple `(s, d)` and the new tuple `(s, d)`
- `s` is a new input integer (no change)
- `d` is a new input integer (no change)

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing two tuples with input integers, `s` is a new input integer, `d` is a new input integer**
