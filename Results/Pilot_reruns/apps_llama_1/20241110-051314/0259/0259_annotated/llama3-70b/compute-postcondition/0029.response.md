Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of `n` tuples with `n` greater than 2, `s` is `buses[2][0]`, `d` is `buses[2][1]`, `i` is 2, `t` remains unchanged, and `time` is `(t - buses[2][0]) % buses[2][1]`. If `time` is less than the current `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to `i + 1`, which is 3. Otherwise, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
