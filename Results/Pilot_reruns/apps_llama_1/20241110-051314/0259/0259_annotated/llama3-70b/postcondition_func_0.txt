The function accepts no parameters, takes input integers `n` and `t`, and `n` tuples of two integers `s` and `d`, calculates the minimum time `(t - s) % d` for each tuple, and prints the index of the tuple with the minimum time plus 1, or -1 if the input list is empty, but may produce incorrect results or errors if the input integers are not positive or if errors occur during input or calculation.
