According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing a tuple with an input integer and another input integer, and the tuple (s, d), `_` is 2, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
