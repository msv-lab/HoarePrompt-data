Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is 1. If `(t - s) % d` is less than the current `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `(t - s) % d` and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
