To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given code and the current state.

The loop iterates over the `buses` list using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the value of each tuple `(s, d)` in the list. 

Given the current state:
- `buses` is a list of at least 1 tuple.
- `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`.
- `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`.
- `_` is `n-1`.
- The value of `i` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `buses` must have at least 2 tuples, because the loop needs to move to the next tuple.
- `i` needs to be incremented to 1, because it is currently 0 and the loop iterates over the indices of the list.
- `s` and `d` need to be updated to the first and second elements of the second tuple in `buses`, respectively, because the loop moves to the next tuple.

The value of `_` and the conditional updates to `min_time` and `ans` do not affect the loop's ability to execute again, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`buses` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is 1**
