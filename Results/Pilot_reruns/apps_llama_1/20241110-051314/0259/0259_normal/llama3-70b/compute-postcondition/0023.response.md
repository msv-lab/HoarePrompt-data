To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

Given the initial state:
- `buses` is a list of at least 2 tuples
- `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`
- `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`
- `_` is `n-1` (Note: The variable name `_` is not typically used in explanations as it's often a throwaway variable in Python, but we'll track it for completeness)
- `i` is 1
- `time` is `(t - s) % d`
- `min_time` is `(t - s) % d`

The code to execute is:
```python
ans = i + 1
```

Now, let's calculate the result:
- The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 1, `ans` will be 2.
- The values of `buses`, `s`, `d`, `_`, `time`, and `min_time` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `buses` is a list of at least 2 tuples
- `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`
- `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`
- `_` is `n-1`
- `i` is 1
- `time` is `(t - s) % d`
- `min_time` is `(t - s) % d`
- `ans` is 2

Output State: **`buses` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `time` is `(t - s) % d`, `min_time` is `(t - s) % d`, and `ans` is 2**
