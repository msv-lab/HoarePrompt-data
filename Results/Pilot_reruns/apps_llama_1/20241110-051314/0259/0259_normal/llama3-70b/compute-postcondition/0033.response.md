Based on the provided parameter constraints, the function accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `buses`. `n` and `t` are positive integers, and `buses` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `s` and `d`.

However, the function definition provided is incomplete, as it does not include the parameters. It should be:
```
def func(n, t, buses):
```
Unfortunately, the output of the function is not provided, so I cannot describe the return value. Please provide the output information, and I will be happy to complete the functionality description.
