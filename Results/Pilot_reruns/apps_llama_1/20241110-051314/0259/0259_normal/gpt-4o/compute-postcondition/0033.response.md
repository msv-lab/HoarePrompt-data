Output State: **The loop calculates the minimum waiting time for a bus and the chosen route. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop iterates over each bus route, calculates the waiting time based on the conditions, and updates `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` if a smaller waiting time is found. After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` is the minimum waiting time among all bus routes, and `chosen_route` is the route with the minimum waiting time. The values of `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` remain unchanged.**
