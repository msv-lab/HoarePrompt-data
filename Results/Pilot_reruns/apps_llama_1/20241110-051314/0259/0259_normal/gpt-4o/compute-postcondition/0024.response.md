To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state of the variables.

The code is: `wait_time = s_i - t`

From the initial state, we know that `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `t` is a positive integer.

The code calculates the `wait_time` by subtracting `t` from `s_i`. 

The output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t**
