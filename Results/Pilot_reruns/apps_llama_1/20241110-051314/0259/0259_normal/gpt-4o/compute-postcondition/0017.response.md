Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes`. If `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is an integer between 1 (inclusive) and `d_i` (inclusive), representing the difference between `d_i` and the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`.***
