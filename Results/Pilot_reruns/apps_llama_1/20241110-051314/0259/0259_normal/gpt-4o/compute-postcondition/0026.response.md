To calculate the output state, we need to understand the given Python code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

The code calculates the `wait_time` using the formula: `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

Here, `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, `t` is a positive integer, and `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`.

Given the initial state, we know that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`.

Since we do not have the exact values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `wait_time`. However, we can express the output state in terms of the calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
