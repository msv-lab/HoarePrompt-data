Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is either 1 (if `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`) or 2 (if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`). `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions: if `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, it is `s_i - t`; if `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, it is 0; otherwise, it is an integer between 1 (inclusive) and `d_i` (inclusive), representing the difference between `d_i` and the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`.***
