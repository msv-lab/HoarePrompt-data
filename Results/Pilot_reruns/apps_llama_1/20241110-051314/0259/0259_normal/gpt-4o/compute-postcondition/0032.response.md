To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next integer, which means `i` has been incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current value of `i`, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`.**
