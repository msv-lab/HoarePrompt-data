`s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`. The values of `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` are not affected. The value of `i` is also not affected, it remains the next integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`.**
