To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that make the loop run. In this case, the loop iterates over the range of `n`, which is already stated to be a positive integer. This means the loop will execute at least once.

However, to make the loop execute meaningfully, we should consider the initial values of the variables involved directly or indirectly with the loop. Here, `i` is the loop variable, and it should start from 0 to make the loop execute as intended.

Given the initial state, we should adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now 0, as this is the starting point of the loop. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself but are part of the program state that could be modified within the loop body (not shown here).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
