The code `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` updates the value of `wait_time`. 

Since `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes` and `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, we can say `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers.

The expression `(t - s_i) % d_i` calculates the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`. Since `t` and `s_i` are positive integers, `(t - s_i)` is an integer. The remainder of an integer divided by a positive integer is an integer between 0 (inclusive) and the divisor (exclusive). Therefore, `(t - s_i) % d_i` is an integer between 0 (inclusive) and `d_i` (exclusive).

The expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` subtracts the remainder from `d_i`. Since `(t - s_i) % d_i` is an integer between 0 (inclusive) and `d_i` (exclusive), `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` is an integer between 1 (inclusive) and `d_i` (inclusive).

The value of `wait_time` is updated to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which is an integer between 1 (inclusive) and `d_i` (inclusive). The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `wait_time` is an integer between 1 (inclusive) and `d_i` (inclusive), `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes**
