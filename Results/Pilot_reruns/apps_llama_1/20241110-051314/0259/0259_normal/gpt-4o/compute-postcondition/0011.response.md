Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 1. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` remains infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. In either case, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`.***
