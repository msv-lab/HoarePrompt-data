Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `wait_time = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `wait_time`.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `t` is a positive integer
- `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers
- `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`
- `min_wait_time` is a positive integer
- `chosen_route` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`
- `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes`

After executing the code, the state of `wait_time` changes to 0, but the states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `wait_time` is 0, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes**
