To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the variables involved.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `n` should be greater than 1 to ensure the loop condition is still met.

Additionally, since `i` is now 1, `s_i` and `d_i` should be updated to the first and second elements of the second pair in `bus_routes`, respectively.

The values of `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

The value of `t` is not related to the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes`.**
