To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step.

1. `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
2. The value of `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, which is a positive integer.
3. The value of `t` is a positive integer.
4. The value of `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, which is a positive integer.
5. The expression `(t - s_i) % d_i` calculates the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`, which is a non-negative integer less than `d_i`.
6. The value of `wait_time` is the difference between `d_i` and the result of the expression `(t - s_i) % d_i`, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `d_i`.

The output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `d_i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `d_i`.**
