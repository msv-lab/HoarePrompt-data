Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, and `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`).

The function initializes two variables: `min_wait_time` to infinity and `chosen_route` to -1.

The function then iterates over each bus route in `bus_routes`. For each route, it calculates the waiting time based on the conditions:

* If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the waiting time is `s_i - t`.
* If `t - s_i` is a multiple of `d_i`, the waiting time is 0.
* Otherwise, the waiting time is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

If the calculated waiting time is less than `min_wait_time`, the function updates `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` accordingly.

After iterating over all bus routes, the function returns `chosen_route`, which is the route with the minimum waiting time.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `n` is 0, the function does not iterate over any bus routes, and `min_wait_time` remains infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. In this case, the function returns -1, which may not be the expected behavior.
* If all bus routes have a waiting time of infinity (i.e., `s_i` is always less than `t` and `d_i` is always 1), the function returns -1, which may not be the expected behavior.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of `n` pairs of positive integers `bus_routes`, and returns the bus route with the minimum waiting time. If `n` is 0 or all bus routes have a waiting time of infinity, the function returns -1. **
