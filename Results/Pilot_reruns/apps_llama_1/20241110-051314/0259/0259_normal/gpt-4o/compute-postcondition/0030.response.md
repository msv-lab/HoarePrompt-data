The value of `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. Since `i` is the next integer, `i + 1` is also an integer. The previous value of `chosen_route` was either 1 or 2, but it is now updated to `i + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes**
