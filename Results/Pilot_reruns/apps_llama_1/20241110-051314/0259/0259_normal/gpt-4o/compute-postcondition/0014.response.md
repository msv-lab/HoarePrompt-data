To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
wait_time = s_i - t
```
From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers.
- `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.
- `min_wait_time` is a positive integer.
- `chosen_route` is 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`.
- `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes`.

The code assigns a new value to `wait_time`, which is the difference between `s_i` and `t`. Since `s_i` is a positive integer (as it's part of a pair of positive integers in `bus_routes`) and `t` is also a positive integer, `wait_time` will be an integer. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `wait_time` without knowing the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, and `d_i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.**
