It seems like there is some missing information in the task you provided. The function `func` is defined without any parameters, but the parameter constraints mention a variable `s`. I'll assume that the function should actually accept a parameter `s`.

Here's my attempt to describe the functionality of the function:

The function `func` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99. However, the output of the function is not provided. Please provide the output information so I can complete the functionality description.

Once the output information is provided, I can update the description accordingly. 

Please provide the output information so I can assist you further.
