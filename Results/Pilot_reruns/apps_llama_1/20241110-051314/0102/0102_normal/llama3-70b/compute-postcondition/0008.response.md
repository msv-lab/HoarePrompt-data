Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. The function prints the string representation of `s` in words: if `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding string from the `ones` list; if `s` is less than 20, it prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list; otherwise, it prints a string representation of the input integer `s` in words, where the tens place is represented by a string from the `tens` list and the ones place is represented by a string from the `ones` list, with a hyphen in between if the ones place is not zero.***
