A list of strings `ones` is created with the names of numbers from 0 to 9. The state of `s` is not affected, so the output state is: `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings ['','one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight','nine'].
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings ['','one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight','nine']**
