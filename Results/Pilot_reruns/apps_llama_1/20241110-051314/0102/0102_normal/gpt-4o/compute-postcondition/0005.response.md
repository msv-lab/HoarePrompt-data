Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The code `n // 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, which gives the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are not taken into account.
2. Since `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, the value of `n // 10` will be an integer between 0 and 9.
3. The list `tens` has 10 elements, with the first element being an empty string and the remaining elements being the tens place names.
4. The code `return tens[n // 10]` returns the element at the index `n // 10` from the `tens` list.

Now, let's analyze the possible values of `n // 10` and the corresponding elements in the `tens` list:

* If `n` is between 0 and 9, `n // 10` is 0, and the returned value is an empty string.
* If `n` is between 10 and 19, `n // 10` is 1, and the returned value is 'ten'.
* If `n` is between 20 and 29, `n // 10` is 2, and the returned value is 'twenty'.
* If `n` is between 30 and 39, `n // 10` is 3, and the returned value is 'thirty'.
* If `n` is between 40 and 49, `n // 10` is 4, and the returned value is 'forty'.
* If `n` is between 50 and 59, `n // 10` is 5, and the returned value is 'fifty'.
* If `n` is between 60 and 69, `n // 10` is 6, and the returned value is 'sixty'.
* If `n` is between 70 and 79, `n // 10` is 7, and the returned value is 'seventy'.
* If `n` is between 80 and 89, `n // 10` is 8, and the returned value is 'eighty'.
* If `n` is between 90 and 99, `n // 10` is 9, and the returned value is 'ninety'.

The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, `ones` is a list ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'], `teens` is a list ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen'], and `tens` is a list ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'], and the function returns the tens place name corresponding to the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, `ones` is a list ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'], `teens` is a list ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen'], and `tens` is a list ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'], and the function returns the tens place name corresponding to the value of `n`.**
