To determine the output state, let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99
- `ones` is a list ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']
- `teens` is a list ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
- `tens` is a list ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']

The code snippet is:
```python
return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
```

Now, let's analyze the code:

- `n // 10` will give the quotient of `n` divided by 10, which represents the tens place of the number `n`. This value will be used to index the `tens` list.
- `n % 10` will give the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which represents the ones place of the number `n`. This value will be used to index the `ones` list.
- The expression `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]` concatenates the string at the index `n // 10` in the `tens` list, a hyphen, and the string at the index `n % 10` in the `ones` list.

However, this code snippet does not handle the cases where `n` is between 10 and 19 (inclusive) correctly, as it does not use the `teens` list for these cases. For numbers between 10 and 19, the correct output should come from the `teens` list, not by combining `tens` and `ones`.

But, based on the given code, let's determine the output state.

For `n` values between 0 and 9, `n // 10` will be 0, and `n % 10` will be `n`. So, the output will be `ones[n]`, but since `tens[0]` is an empty string, the actual output will be `-` + `ones[n]`.

For `n` values between 10 and 19, the code will incorrectly use `tens[1]` (which is 'ten') and `ones[n % 10]`, resulting in incorrect outputs like 'ten-one', 'ten-two', etc.

For `n` values between 20 and 99, `n // 10` will give the correct tens place, and `n % 10` will give the correct ones place, so the output will be a correct combination of `tens[n // 10]` and `ones[n % 10]`, separated by a hyphen.

So, the output state will be:
- For `n` between 0 and 9: an empty string + '-' + `ones[n]`
- For `n` between 10 and 19: incorrect outputs like 'ten-' + `ones[n % 10]`
- For `n` between 20 and 99: `tens[n // 10]` + '-' + `ones[n % 10]`

However, since the code does not handle the `teens` list correctly, the actual output state will not be as expected for numbers between 10 and 19.

Output State: **For `n` between 0 and 9: an empty string + '-' + `ones[n]`; For `n` between 10 and 19: incorrect outputs like 'ten-' + `ones[n % 10]`; For `n` between 20 and 99: `tens[n // 10]` + '-' + `ones[n % 10]`, and the function returns this value.**
