Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly converts an integer score between 0 and 99 into its English word representation. The program handles the cases for ones, teens, and tens correctly, and it also handles the cases where the number is a multiple of 10.

The program uses three lists to store the word representations of ones, teens, and tens. It then uses conditional statements to determine which list to use based on the input number. If the number is between 0 and 9, it uses the ones list. If the number is between 11 and 19, it uses the teens list. If the number is between 10 and 99, it uses the tens list and appends the ones list if the number is not a multiple of 10.

The program also handles the case where the input number is 10 correctly, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description but is still a valid input.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including 0, 1, 6, 10, 11, 20, 99, and it produces the correct output in all cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
