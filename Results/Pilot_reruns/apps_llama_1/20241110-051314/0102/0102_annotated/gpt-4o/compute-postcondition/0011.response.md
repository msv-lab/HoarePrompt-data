The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99. After executing the function body, the function returns a string representation of `n` based on its value. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` such that 0 <= n <= 99, and return its string representation in the following format: 
- if `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representation of `n` from the `ones` list; 
- if `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation of `n` from the `teens` list; 
- if `n` is a multiple of 10 and greater than or equal to 10, it returns the string representation of the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list; 
- if `n` is greater than 10 and not a multiple of 10, it returns a string in the format "tens-ones" representing the tens and ones places of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 0 <= n <= 99, and returns its string representation in the format "ones", "teens", "tens", or "tens-ones" based on the value of `n`.**
