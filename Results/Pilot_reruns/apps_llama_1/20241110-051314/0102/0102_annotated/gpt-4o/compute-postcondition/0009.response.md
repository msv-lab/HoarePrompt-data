Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from ten to ninety. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns a string representing a number between eleven and nineteen. If `n` is a multiple of 10 and greater than or equal to 10, the function returns a string representing the tens place of `n`. If `n` is greater than 10 and not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string in the format "tens-ones" representing the tens and ones places of `n`. If `n` is less than 10, the function does not return any value.***
