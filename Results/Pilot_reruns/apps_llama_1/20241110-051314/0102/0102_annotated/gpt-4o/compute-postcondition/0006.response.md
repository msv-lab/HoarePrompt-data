To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code:

1. `n // 10` calculates the quotient of `n` divided by 10, which gives the tens digit of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, the tens digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

2. `tens[n // 10]` uses the tens digit to index the `tens` list, which contains strings representing tens from ten to ninety. This will give the string representation of the tens digit of `n`.

3. `n % 10` calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which gives the ones digit of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, the ones digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

4. `ones[n % 10]` uses the ones digit to index the `ones` list, which contains strings representing numbers from zero to nine. This will give the string representation of the ones digit of `n`.

5. The function returns the concatenation of the tens string, a hyphen, and the ones string.

The state of the variables does not change, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from ten to ninety, and the function returns a string in the format "tens-ones".

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from ten to ninety, and the function returns a string in the format "tens-ones".**
