Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly handles all possible input cases from 0 to 99.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

* For numbers less than 10, it uses the `ones` list to print the correct word.
* For numbers between 10 and 19, it uses the `teens` list to print the correct word.
* For numbers 20 and above, it uses the `tens` list to print the correct tens word and appends the ones word if the number is not a multiple of 10. The `-` character is correctly used to separate the tens and ones words.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as printing "twenty" for the input 20, and "ninety-nine" for the input 99.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
