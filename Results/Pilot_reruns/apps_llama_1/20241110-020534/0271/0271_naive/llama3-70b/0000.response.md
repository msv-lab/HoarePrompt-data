Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program works as expected for all potential cases. If the input number `n` is already a multiple of 10, it simply prints `n`. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the remainder (`n % 10`). If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder (`10 - n % 10`).

The program handles all edge cases correctly:

* If `n` is 0, it prints 0.
* If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n`.
* If `n` ends with a digit less than or equal to 5, it rounds down correctly.
* If `n` ends with a digit greater than 5, it rounds up correctly.

The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correct behavior of the program. Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and I conclude that the program is correct.
