Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to round the input number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The logic is as follows:

* If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program subtracts the remainder from `n` to get the rounded number. This is because the nearest integer that ends with 0 is the one that is less than or equal to `n`.
* If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5, the program adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n` to get the rounded number. This is because the nearest integer that ends with 0 is the one that is greater than `n`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When `n` is a multiple of 10, the program returns `n` as it is already rounded.
* When `n` is not a multiple of 10, the program correctly rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0.

The program also passes all the provided test cases, which further confirms its correctness.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
