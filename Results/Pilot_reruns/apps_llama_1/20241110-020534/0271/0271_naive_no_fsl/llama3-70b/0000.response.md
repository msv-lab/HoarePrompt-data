Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. If the input number `n` already ends with 0, the program prints `n` as it is, since it's already rounded to the nearest integer ending with 0.
2. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, the program rounds down to the nearest integer ending with 0 by subtracting the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`).
3. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, the program rounds up to the nearest integer ending with 0 by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`10 - n % 10`).

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n` as it is.
* If `n` ends with a digit less than or equal to 5, it rounds down correctly.
* If `n` ends with a digit greater than 5, it rounds up correctly.

All the provided examples are correctly handled by the program, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
