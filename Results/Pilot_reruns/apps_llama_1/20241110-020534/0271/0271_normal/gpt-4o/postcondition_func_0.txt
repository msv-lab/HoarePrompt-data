The function takes an integer input from the user, calculates the remainder when divided by 10, and prints the resulting value after adjusting it based on the remainder. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from the input. Otherwise, it adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to the input, potentially resulting in a value outside the range of 1-5. The function does not handle errors during the input process.
