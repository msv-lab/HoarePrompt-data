To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step.

1. The initial state provides that `n` is an input integer and `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9.
2. The code snippet is `result = n - remainder`.
3. This line of code introduces a new variable `result` and assigns it the value of `n` minus `remainder`.
4. Since `n` is an input integer, its value can be any integer.
5. `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, so its value is constrained within this range.
6. The subtraction `n - remainder` will yield a value that depends on the specific values of `n` and `remainder`. However, we can say that `result` will be an integer because both `n` and `remainder` are integers.
7. The output state will include the initial state variables (`n` and `remainder`) and the newly introduced variable `result`.

Given the constraints and operations, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, `result` is `n` minus `remainder`**
