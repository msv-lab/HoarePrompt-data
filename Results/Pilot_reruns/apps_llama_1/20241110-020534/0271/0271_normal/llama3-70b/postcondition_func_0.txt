The function takes an integer input from the user, checks if it's a multiple of 10, and prints the input value if it is. If not, it prints the nearest multiple of 10 based on the remainder of the input divided by 10. However, it does not handle non-integer or negative inputs, and it does not check for inputs greater than 10^9.
