To calculate the output state, let's break down the code step by step.

The code `print(n + (10 - n % 10))` is executed.

1. `n % 10` calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10. This will give a value between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
2. `10 - n % 10` subtracts the remainder from 10, which will give a value between 1 and 10 (inclusive). This effectively "rounds up" `n` to the nearest multiple of 10.
3. `n + (10 - n % 10)` adds `n` to the result of the previous step, effectively replacing `n` with the next multiple of 10.

Since `n` is an input integer, let's consider some examples:

* If `n` is 12, `n % 10` is 2, `10 - n % 10` is 8, and `n + (10 - n % 10)` is 20.
* If `n` is 25, `n % 10` is 5, `10 - n % 10` is 5, and `n + (10 - n % 10)` is 30.

In general, the output will be the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and the function prints the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`.**
