The code `print(n - n % 10)` calculates the value of `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then prints the result. The value of `n` is an input integer, but the specific value is unknown.

The expression `n - n % 10` effectively rounds down `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. For example, if `n` is 17, `n % 10` is 7, and `n - n % 10` is 10. If `n` is 25, `n % 10` is 5, and `n - n % 10` is 20.

Since the specific value of `n` is unknown, the output of the print statement is also unknown, but it will be a multiple of 10.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and the function prints a multiple of 10**
