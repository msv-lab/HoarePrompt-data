The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value `int(input())` to `n`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer.

However, in this case, the initial state of `n` is overridden by the new input. The new value of `n` can be any integer, not necessarily less than or equal to 10^9, because the input can be any integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
