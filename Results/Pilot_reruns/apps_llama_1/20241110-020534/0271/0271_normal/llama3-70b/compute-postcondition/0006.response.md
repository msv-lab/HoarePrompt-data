It seems like there is a mistake in the problem description. The function definition is `def func():`, which means it doesn't accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `n` as a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9.

Assuming the function definition should be `def func(n):`, here's the answer:

The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9. Unfortunately, the output is not provided, so I'll describe the functionality based on the input parameter.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n` less than or equal to 10^9.**
