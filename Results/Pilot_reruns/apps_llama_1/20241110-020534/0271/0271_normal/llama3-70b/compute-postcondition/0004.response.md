Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, and the function prints the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`.***
