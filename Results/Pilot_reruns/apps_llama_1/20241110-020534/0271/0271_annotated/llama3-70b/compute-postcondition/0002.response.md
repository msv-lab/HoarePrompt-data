To determine the output state, let's break down the code step by step:

1. The expression `n % 10` calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which gives the last digit of `n`.
2. The expression `n - n % 10` subtracts the last digit from `n`, effectively removing the last digit and leaving the number truncated to the nearest ten.

Since `n` is an input integer, the output will be the input integer truncated to the nearest ten.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and the function prints the input integer truncated to the nearest ten**
