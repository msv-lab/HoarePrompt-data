Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `result = n + (10 - remainder)` calculates a new value and assigns it to the variable `result`.

We know that `n` is an input integer, and `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9.

The expression `10 - remainder` will evaluate to a value between 1 and 10, since `remainder` is between 0 and 9.

The value of `result` will be the sum of `n` and the value of `10 - remainder`. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `result` will depend on the input value of `n`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, `result` is an integer that is `n` plus a value between 1 and 10.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, `result` is an integer that is `n` plus a value between 1 and 10**
