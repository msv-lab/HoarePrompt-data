Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is the difference between `n` and `remainder`. Otherwise, `result` is `n` plus a value between 1 and 5 (10 minus `remainder`), effectively making `remainder` 10 or a multiple of 10 when added to `n`.***
