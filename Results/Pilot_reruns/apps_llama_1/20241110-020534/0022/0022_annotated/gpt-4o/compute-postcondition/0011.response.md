Output State: **The loop checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string, moving towards the center. If any pair of characters does not match, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the function does not return `False`, implying that `s` is a palindrome. The loop executes only if `n` is at least 2, because the loop iterates `n // 2` times. If `n` is 0 or 1, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return `False`. The value of `i` after the loop is `n // 2 - 1`. The relationship between `s` and `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.**
