Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i` in `s`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, no explicit action is taken, maintaining the original state of `s`, `n`, and `i`.***
