To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we'll analyze the loop condition and the current states.

The loop condition is `i in range(n // 2)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`.

Currently, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2`. Since `i` is 2, `n // 2` must be at least 3. This implies that `n` must be at least 6.

The other states, `s` and `is_spalindrome`, do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 6, `i` is 2**
