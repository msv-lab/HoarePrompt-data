Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` in `s`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to `False` and the loop is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `is_spalindrome` and the loop continues. In all cases, `s`, `n`, and `i` retain their initial values.***
