`s` is an input string, and `len(s)` returns the length of the string `s`. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(s)`, so `n` is the length of the input string `s`. The state of `s` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is `s` is an input string, and `n` is the length of the input string.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, and `n` is the length of the input string**
