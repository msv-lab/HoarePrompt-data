The code `n = len(s)` assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since the length of `s` is at least 1 and at most 1000, the value of `n` will be an integer between 1 and 1000. The state of the string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 1 and at most 1000, consisting only of English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
