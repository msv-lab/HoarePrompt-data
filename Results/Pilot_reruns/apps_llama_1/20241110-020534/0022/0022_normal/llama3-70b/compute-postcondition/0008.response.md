Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `is_spalindrome = False` assigns a new value to the variable `is_spalindrome`. The previous value of `is_spalindrome` is True, but it is overwritten by the new value False.

The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * i + 1, `i` is the incremented value, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * i + 1, `i` is the incremented value, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
