`n` is assigned the value `len(s)`, where `len` returns the length of the string `s`. The value of `s` is an input string, so the value of `n` is the length of the input string. The state of `s` is not affected, so the output state is `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of the input string.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of the input string**
