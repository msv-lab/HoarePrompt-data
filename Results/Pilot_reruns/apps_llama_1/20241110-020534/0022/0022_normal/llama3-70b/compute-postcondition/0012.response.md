To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. The initial state is: `s` is an input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * (`i` + 1) + 1, `i` is the incremented value, `is_spalindrome` is True.

2. The code `is_spalindrome = False` directly assigns the value `False` to the variable `is_spalindrome`.

3. This assignment does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `i`. It only changes the value of `is_spalindrome` from `True` to `False`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is: `s` is an input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * (`i` + 1) + 1, `i` is the incremented value, `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * (`i` + 1) + 1, `i` is the incremented value, `is_spalindrome` is False**
