Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine the result of the voting system. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by adding the unknown votes (z) to the known upvotes (x) and downvotes (y).
2. Then, it checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes. If so, it prints '-', indicating that the result is definitely negative.
3. If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints '+', indicating that the result is definitely positive.
4. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that the result is uncertain, and the program prints '?'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the result is definitely positive or negative (e.g., examples 1-3)
* When the result is uncertain (e.g., example 4)
* When there are no unknown votes (z=0)
* When there are no known upvotes or downvotes (x=0 or y=0)

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
