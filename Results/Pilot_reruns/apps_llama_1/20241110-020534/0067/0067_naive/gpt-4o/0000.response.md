Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the outcome of the voting based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible number of upvotes and downvotes by considering the unknown votes as either upvotes or downvotes.

The program then checks the following conditions:

- If the maximum possible number of upvotes is less than the minimum possible number of downvotes, the outcome is definitely "-".
- If the maximum possible number of downvotes is less than the minimum possible number of upvotes, the outcome is definitely "+".
- If neither of the above conditions is true, the outcome is uncertain, and the program prints "?".

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible scenarios, including the edge cases where the number of unknown votes is 0. Therefore, the program is correct.
