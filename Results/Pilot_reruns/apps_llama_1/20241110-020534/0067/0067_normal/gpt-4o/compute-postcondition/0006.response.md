The code prints '+' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is an input integer equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`, `min_downvotes` is an input integer equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`.**
