Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`, `max_downvotes` are input integers where `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals the sum of `x` and `z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, and `max_downvotes` equals the sum of `y` and `z`. If the sum of `y` and `z` is less than `x`, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'***
