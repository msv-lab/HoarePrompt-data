`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, which is an input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is an input integer equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`, and `min_downvotes` is an input integer equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is an input integer equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`, and `min_downvotes` is an input integer equal to `y`.**
