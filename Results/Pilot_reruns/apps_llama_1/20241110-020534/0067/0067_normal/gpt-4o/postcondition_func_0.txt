The function takes three integers as input from the user, calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes, and prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' otherwise. The function does not validate the input values, so it may produce incorrect results if the input values are outside the range 0 to 100, are not integers, or are missing.
