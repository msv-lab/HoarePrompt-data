The function reads three integers from the input string and prints '+' if the first integer is greater than the sum of the other two, '-' if the first integer is less than the second, '0' if the first two integers are equal and the third is 0, and '?' otherwise. However, the function does not handle invalid input formats, out-of-range integers, or the case where all three integers are equal.
