The code prints the string '0' to the console. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, and their values are determined by the input string, and '0' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, and their values are determined by the input string, and '0' is printed to the console.**
