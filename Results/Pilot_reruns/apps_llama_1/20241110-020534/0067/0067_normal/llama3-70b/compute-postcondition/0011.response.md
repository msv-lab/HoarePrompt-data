Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `func` accepts no parameters.
2. It reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. The code checks the conditions and prints the corresponding output:
	* If `x > y + z`, it prints '+'.
	* If `x < y`, it prints '-'.
	* If `x == y`, it checks if `z == 0`. If true, it prints '0', otherwise it prints '?'.
	* If none of the above conditions are true, it prints '?'.

Now, let's look at the potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The code does not handle the case where the input string is not in the format of three integers separated by spaces. In this case, the `map(int, input().split())` line will raise a `ValueError`.
* The code does not handle the case where the input integers are not within the range 0 to 100. Although the annotations mention this range, the code does not enforce it.
* The code does not handle the case where `x`, `y`, and `z` are equal. In this case, the code will print '?'.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function reads three integers from the input string and prints '+' if the first integer is greater than the sum of the other two, '-' if the first integer is less than the second, '0' if the first two integers are equal and the third is 0, and '?' otherwise. However, the function does not handle invalid input formats, out-of-range integers, or the case where all three integers are equal. **
