The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer using the `map` function, and assigns the results to `x`, `y`, and `z`, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, and the code updates these values based on the input, the output state will be the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` after the input is processed.

However, without knowing the specific input, we cannot determine the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. Therefore, the output state will be a description of the possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, and their values are determined by the input string.**
