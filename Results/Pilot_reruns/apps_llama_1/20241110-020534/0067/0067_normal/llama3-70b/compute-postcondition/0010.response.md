Based on the provided information, I will describe the functionality of the function.


The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, the problem statement mentions that x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. This implies that the function likely uses these variables internally or is expected to be used in a context where these variables are defined.


Since there is no output description provided, I will assume that the function's return value is not specified or is not relevant to the problem at hand.


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and has an unspecified return value, with the context implying the use of integer variables x, y, and z within the range 0 to 100.**
