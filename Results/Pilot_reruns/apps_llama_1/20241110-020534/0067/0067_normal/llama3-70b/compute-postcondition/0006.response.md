The code `print('?')` prints the string '?' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, and their values are determined by the input string, and '?' is printed to the console.**
