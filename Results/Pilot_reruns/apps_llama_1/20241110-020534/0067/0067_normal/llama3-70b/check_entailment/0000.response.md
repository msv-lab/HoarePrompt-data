Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. It handles the cases where there are more upvotes than downvotes, more downvotes than upvotes, and equal upvotes and downvotes. It also handles the case where the result is uncertain.

However, I do notice that the code does not explicitly handle the case where all three integers are equal. But upon closer inspection, I realize that this case is actually covered by the condition `x == y` and `z == 0`, which prints '0'.

Now, let's examine the output hints. The hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the cases where the function prints '?'.

After reviewing the code, the problem description, and the output hints, I conclude that the code is correct. It handles all the cases described in the problem description and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly handles all the cases described in the problem description. It prints '+' if there are more upvotes than downvotes, '-' if there are more downvotes than upvotes, '0' if there are equal upvotes and downvotes, and '?' if the result is uncertain. The code also handles the edge cases where all three integers are equal and where the result is uncertain. The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the cases where the function prints '?'.
