The function `func` accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` as input from the user, which are assumed to be within the range of 0 to 100. 

However, the function does not explicitly validate or restrict the input range. 

The function calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on the input values. 

It then checks the following conditions:

- If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'.
- If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'.
- In all other cases, it prints '?'.

The function does not handle cases where the input values are not integers or are outside the assumed range of 0 to 100. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` as input from the user, calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes, and prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' otherwise, without validating the input range or type. **
