The code assigns the value of `y` to `min_downvotes`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `min_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x + z`. 

After execution, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `min_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is an integer with the value of `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `min_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is an integer with the value of `y`.**
