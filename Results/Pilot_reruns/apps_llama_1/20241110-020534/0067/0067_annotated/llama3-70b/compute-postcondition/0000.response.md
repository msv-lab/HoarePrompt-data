The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of three input integers to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

The `input().split()` function splits the input string into three separate strings based on whitespace, and `map(int,...)` converts these strings into integers.

Since the initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`, but does not provide specific values, the output state will be that `x`, `y`, and `z` are three input integers.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are three input integers**
