Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One case where the program fails is when the substring `sub` is not a contiguous substring of the original number `s`. The program assumes that `sub` is a contiguous substring and generates all permutations of the remaining characters. However, if `sub` is not contiguous, the program will not be able to find the correct smallest number.

For example, if the input is `s = "123456"` and `sub = "12"`, the program will not be able to find the correct smallest number because it assumes that `sub` is a contiguous substring of `s`. However, in this case, `sub` is not contiguous, and the correct smallest number is `1123456`, which the program will not be able to find.

The program needs to be modified to handle the case where `sub` is not a contiguous substring of `s`. One possible approach is to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming, to find the smallest number that contains `sub` as a substring.
