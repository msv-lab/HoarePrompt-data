Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the substring t is not a consecutive substring of s. For example, if s = "123456" and t = "214", the program will return 214123456, which is not the smallest possible initial integer n.

In this case, the correct output should be 214365, because the substring "214" can be a part of the original number "214365" and the number of digits in the original number is 6, which is equal to the number of digits in the substring "123456" plus the number of digits in the substring "214" minus the number of overlapping digits.

The program does not handle this case correctly because it simply concatenates the substring t to the end of the string s, without considering the possibility that the substring t may be a part of the original number s.
