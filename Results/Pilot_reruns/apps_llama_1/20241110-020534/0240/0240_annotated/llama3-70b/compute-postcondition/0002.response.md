According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the state more specific, we can adjust it to `s` has at least 1 character and `c` is the first character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character in `s`**
