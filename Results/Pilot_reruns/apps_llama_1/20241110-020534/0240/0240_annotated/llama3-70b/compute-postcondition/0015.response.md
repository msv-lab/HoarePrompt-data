The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `t`, both of which are non-empty strings consisting of digits. The function also uses a set `t_set` containing the unique digits present in `t`, and a string `n` which is the original string `s` followed by the string `t`. After executing the function body, the function returns the integer value of the string `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-empty strings `s` and `t` consisting of digits, and return the integer value of the string formed by appending `t` to `s` and then appending the count of digits in the resulting string.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-empty strings s and t consisting of digits, and returns the integer value of the string formed by appending t to s and then appending the count of digits in the resulting string.**
