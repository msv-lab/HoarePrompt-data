To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for perm in permutations(chars):`. This means that the loop will iterate over all permutations of the string `chars`.

The current state is:
* `chars` is a non-empty string of digits
* `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`
* `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations
* `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations

Since the loop will iterate over all permutations of `chars`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `perm`. The next permutation of `chars` should be the next one in the sequence of all permutations.

The states of `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` do not need to be adjusted, as they are not directly related to the loop iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations**
