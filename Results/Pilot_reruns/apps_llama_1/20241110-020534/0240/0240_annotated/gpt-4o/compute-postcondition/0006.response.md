The code yields the value of `candidate`, which is the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of the next permutation of `chars`. The state of the variables does not change, but the value of `candidate` is yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of the next permutation of `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
