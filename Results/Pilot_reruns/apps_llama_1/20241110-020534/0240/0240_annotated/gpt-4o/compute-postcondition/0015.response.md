To provide a complete answer, I will need the output cases for the function. However, based on the code and annotations, I can make an educated guess about the functionality of the function.

The function `generate_possible_numbers` appears to accept two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, and `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`.

The function generates all permutations of `chars` and yields all valid numbers that contain `sub` as a substring. If no valid numbers are found, the loop does not yield any values. If `chars` is empty or `sub` is not a substring of any permutation of `chars`, the loop does not execute.

However, without the output cases, it's difficult to provide a complete summary of the function's functionality. 

Assuming the output cases are as follows:

- If `sub` is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, the function yields all valid numbers that contain `sub` as a substring.
- If `sub` is not a substring of any permutation of `chars`, the function does not yield any values.
- If `chars` is empty, the function does not yield any values.

With these output cases in mind, here is a summary of the function's functionality:

Functionality: ** The function generates all permutations of a given string of digits `chars` and yields all valid numbers that contain a given substring `sub`. If `sub` is not found in any permutation of `chars` or if `chars` is empty, the function does not yield any values. **
