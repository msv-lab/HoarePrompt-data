Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations. If `candidate` is a valid number containing `sub` as a substring, then `candidate` is yielded. Otherwise, no value is yielded.***
