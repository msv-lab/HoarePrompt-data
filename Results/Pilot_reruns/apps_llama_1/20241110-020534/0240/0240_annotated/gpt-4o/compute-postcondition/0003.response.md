Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, the function does not yield any value.***
