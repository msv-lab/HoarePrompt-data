The function accepts two parameters `s` and `sub`, where `s` is a non-empty string of digits and `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits. It returns the smallest possible number that can be generated from the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters in `sub`, combined with the characters in `sub`. However, it does not guarantee a valid solution if `sub` is not a substring of `s`, and it does not handle non-digit characters in `s` or `sub`.
