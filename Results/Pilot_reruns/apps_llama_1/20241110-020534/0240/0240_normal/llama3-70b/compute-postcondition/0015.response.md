The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`. Both `s` and `t` are non-empty strings consisting only of digits. Additionally, `s` contains all the digits of `t`. After executing the function body, the function returns an integer `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-empty strings `s` and `t` consisting only of digits, where `s` contains all the digits of `t`, and return an integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `t` consisting only of digits, where `s` contains all the digits of `t`, and returns an integer `n`.**
