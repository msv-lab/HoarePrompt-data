The function returns `int(n)`, where `n` is a substring of `s` containing all the digits that are present in `t`, followed by the entire string `t`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `s` remains unchanged, `t_set` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, and the function returns `int(n)`.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `t_set` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, and the function returns `int(n)`**
