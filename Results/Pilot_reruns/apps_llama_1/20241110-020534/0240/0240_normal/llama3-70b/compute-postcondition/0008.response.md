To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for c in s:`, which means the loop will iterate over each character `c` in the string `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, contains all the digits of `t`, and has at least one more character after the first one.
- `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits.
- `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`.
- `n` is a string that may be empty, contain the first character of `s`, or contain the previous value of `n` concatenated with the second character of `s` if the second character of `s` is in `t_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character that hasn't been processed yet. Since `s` has at least one more character after the first one and we've just finished an iteration, we can infer that `s` must have at least one more character after the second one for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `s` must have at least one more character after the second one.
- The second character of `s` has been processed, so we move to the next character. If `s` had more than two characters, it still contains all the digits of `t`, but now the "second character" in the description would refer to the third character of the original string, and so on.

Given the adjustments, the new state is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, contains all the digits of `t`, and has at least one more character after the current first character, `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`, `n` is a string containing the previous value of `n` concatenated with the previous second character of `s` if it was in `t_set`, otherwise remains unchanged.**

However, to adhere strictly to the requested format and given the instructions, we simplify the state description focusing on the essential changes and what's provided:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, contains all the digits of `t`, and has at least one more character after the current first character, `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`, `n` is a string that may be empty or contain characters from `s` based on previous conditions.**
