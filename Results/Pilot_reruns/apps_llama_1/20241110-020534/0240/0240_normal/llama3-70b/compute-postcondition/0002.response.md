According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `s` is already stated to be a non-empty string, we need to adjust the state to reflect the start of the loop iteration. Specifically, we need to introduce the loop variable `c` and set it to the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits and contains all the digits of `t`, `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`**
