The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `t` consisting only of digits, where `s` contains all the digits of `t`, and returns an integer `n`. `n` is constructed by appending all the digits of `s` that are also present in `t`, followed by the entire string `t`. If `s` is empty, the function raises a `ValueError`. If `t` is empty, the function returns the integer value of `t`. If `s` contains digits not present in `t`, these digits are not included in `n`. If `t` contains duplicate digits, these duplicates are removed.
