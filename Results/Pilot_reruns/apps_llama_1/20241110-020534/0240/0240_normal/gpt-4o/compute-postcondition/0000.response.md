According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `chars`. If `chars` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. The `permutations` function generates all possible permutations of the characters in `chars`. 

Before the loop starts, `chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, and `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, but these states do not ensure that the loop will execute. The loop will execute if `chars` has at least 1 character. 

So, for the loop to be executed, `chars` must have at least 1 character, and `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`. 

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`**
