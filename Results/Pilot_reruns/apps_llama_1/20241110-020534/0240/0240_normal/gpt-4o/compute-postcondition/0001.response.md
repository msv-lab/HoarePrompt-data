The value of `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which is a string formed by concatenating all characters in `perm`. Since `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`, `candidate` will be a permutation of `chars`. The states of `chars` and `sub` are not affected.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`, and `candidate` is a permutation of `chars`**
