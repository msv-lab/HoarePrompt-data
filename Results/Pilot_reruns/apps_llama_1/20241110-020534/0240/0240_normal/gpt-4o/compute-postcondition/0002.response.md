To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character.
- `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits.
- `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`.
- `candidate` is a permutation of `chars`.

The code snippet is:
```python
yield candidate
```

This code uses the `yield` keyword, which is used in Python to define generators. When `yield` is encountered, the function returns the value specified by `yield`, but it also remembers the state of the function so that when the function is called again, it can pick up where it left off.

Given the initial state, the impact of the code is that the `candidate` permutation of `chars` is yielded. This means that the value of `candidate` is returned by the generator, but the state of the variables (`chars`, `sub`, `perm`, and `candidate`) is preserved.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character.
- `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits.
- `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`.
- `candidate` is a permutation of `chars`, and the function yields the value of `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`, `candidate` is a permutation of `chars`, and the function yields the value of `candidate`.**
