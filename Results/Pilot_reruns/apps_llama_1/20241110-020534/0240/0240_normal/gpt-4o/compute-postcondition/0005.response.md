The value of `candidate` is reassigned to be the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`. Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be a permutation of `chars` as well.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`**
