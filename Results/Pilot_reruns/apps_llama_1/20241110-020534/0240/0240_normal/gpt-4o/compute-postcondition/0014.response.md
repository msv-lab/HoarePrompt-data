The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, and `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, with no leading zeroes if its length is greater than 1.

Please provide the output information (i.e., the return value) so I can complete the functionality description. I will format it according to the specified format.
