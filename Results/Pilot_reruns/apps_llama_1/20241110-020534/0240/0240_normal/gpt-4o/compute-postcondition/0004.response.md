To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop iterates over the permutations of `chars`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another permutation of `chars` that hasn't been processed yet.

At the end of the previous iteration, `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`, and `candidate` is a permutation of `chars`. This means that `perm` has already been processed, and we need to move on to the next permutation.

Since `chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, and `perm` is one of its permutations, we can conclude that there are more permutations of `chars` if and only if `chars` has more than one character.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

* `chars` remains a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character.
* `sub` remains a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits (no change needed).
* `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars` (but we don't know what it is, so we can't specify its value).
* `candidate` needs to be updated to a permutation of `chars` that hasn't been processed yet (but we don't know what it is, so we can't specify its value).

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a permutation of `chars`**
