According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `chars` and the `permutations` function. The `permutations` function generates all possible permutations of the input string `chars`. If there are more permutations left to generate, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `permutations` function must have more permutations to generate. This means that `perm` and `candidate` should be adjusted to be the next permutation of `chars` again.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`**
