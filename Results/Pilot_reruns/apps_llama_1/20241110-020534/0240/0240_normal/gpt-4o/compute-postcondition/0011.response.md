Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, which is the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function does not yield any value.***
