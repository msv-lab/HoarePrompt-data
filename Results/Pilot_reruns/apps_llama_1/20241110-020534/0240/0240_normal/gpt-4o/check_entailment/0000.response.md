Correctness: **False**.

The code does not handle cases where the input string `s` or the substring `sub` contains leading zeroes. In such cases, the function `func_1` may return incorrect results or raise errors. 

For example, if `s` is "003512" and `sub` is "021", the function `func_1` will correctly return "30021". However, if `s` is "003512" and `sub` is "012", the function `func_1` will incorrectly return "30012" because it does not account for the leading zeroes in `sub`.

Additionally, the function `is_valid_number` uses an undefined variable `n_len`, which will result in a `NameError`. Even if `n_len` were defined, the function would not correctly validate the number because it does not check if the number has leading zeroes.

The function `generate_possible_numbers` does not handle cases where `chars` or `sub` contains non-digit characters or leading zeroes. It also does not provide any error handling for these cases.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of cases that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
