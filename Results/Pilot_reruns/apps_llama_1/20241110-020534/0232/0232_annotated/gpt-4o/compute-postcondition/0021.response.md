Output State: **The function returns 'NO', `right` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to the number of times the inner while loop executed, and `current_counts` reflects the counts of colors in the subarray from index `left` to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, `left`, `right`, and `current_counts` remain unchanged. If `desired_counts` is empty, `left`, `right`, and `current_counts` remain unchanged.**
