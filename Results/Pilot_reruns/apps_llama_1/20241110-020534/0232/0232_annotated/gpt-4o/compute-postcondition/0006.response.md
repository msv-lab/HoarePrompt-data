Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `colors` is a list of integers in the range `{1, 2,..., m}` of length `n`, `k` is a list of positive integers of length `m`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `m` associated with positive integer values from `k`, `current_counts` is a dictionary with `current_counts[colors[right]]` incremented by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0. If all colors in `colors` have reached their desired counts as specified in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return 'YES', indicating that not all colors have reached their desired counts.***
