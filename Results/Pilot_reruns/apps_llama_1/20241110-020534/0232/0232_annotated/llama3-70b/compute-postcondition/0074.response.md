Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is some value, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `color` is `colors[i + 2]`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of the key `colors[i]` or `colors[i + 1]` is incremented by 1, and the value of the key `colors[i + 2]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
