The values of `n` and `m` are reassigned based on the input, but the previous constraints on `n` and `m` are still valid. The input values of `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= m <= n. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of integers of length n such that 1 <= colors[i] <= m for all i, and counts is a list of non-negative integers of length m such that 1 <= sum(counts) <= n.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of integers of length n such that 1 <= colors[i] <= m for all i, and counts is a list of non-negative integers of length m such that 1 <= sum(counts) <= n**
