The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+1`, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is equal to the value of `colors[i+1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `window_counts[colors[j+1]]` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
