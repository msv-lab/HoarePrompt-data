Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n`, `colors` is a list of input integers with at least 1 more element, `counts` is a list of input integers, `color` is the next element in the `colors` list, and `color_counts` is updated such that if `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, otherwise, its value remains unchanged.***
