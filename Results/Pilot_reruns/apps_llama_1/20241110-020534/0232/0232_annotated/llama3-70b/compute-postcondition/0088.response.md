Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is equal to the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[colors[j]]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
