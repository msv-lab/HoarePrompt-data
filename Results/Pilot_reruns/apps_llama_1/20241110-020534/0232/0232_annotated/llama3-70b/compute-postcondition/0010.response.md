Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n`, `colors` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `counts` is a list of input integers. The dictionary `color_counts` is updated such that if `color` is not already a key, it is added with a value of 0, otherwise its value remains unchanged, and other keys retain their previous values.***
