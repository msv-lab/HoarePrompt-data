Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+1`, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is equal to the value of `colors[i+1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `window_counts[colors[j+1]]` remains unchanged. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
