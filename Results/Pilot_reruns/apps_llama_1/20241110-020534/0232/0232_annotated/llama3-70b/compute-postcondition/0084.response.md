Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than `i`, and `color` is equal to the value of `colors[j]`. The `window_counts` is a dictionary where the key is `color` and the value is 0 if `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`; otherwise, `window_counts` remains unchanged.***
