To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State:
- `i` is less than `n - 1`
- `j` is equal to `i + 2`
- `colors` is the list of colors
- `counts` is the target counts
- `color` is the `(i+2)`-th color in the `colors` list
- `found` remains unchanged
- If the `(i+2)`-th color is not in the `window_counts` dictionary, the count of this color in `window_counts` is reset to 0, otherwise, the `window_counts` dictionary remains unchanged

Given Code:
```python
window_counts[color] += 1
```
Now, let's think step by step:

- The code increments the count of `color` in the `window_counts` dictionary by 1.
- Since `color` is the `(i+2)`-th color in the `colors` list, the count of this specific color in `window_counts` will be incremented.
- The other variables (`i`, `j`, `colors`, `counts`, and `found`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State:
- `i` is less than `n - 1`
- `j` is equal to `i + 2`
- `colors` is the list of colors
- `counts` is the target counts
- `color` is the `(i+2)`-th color in the `colors` list
- `found` remains unchanged
- The count of `color` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1

Output State: **`i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts, `color` is the `(i+2)`-th color in the `colors` list, `found` remains unchanged, and the count of `color` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1**
