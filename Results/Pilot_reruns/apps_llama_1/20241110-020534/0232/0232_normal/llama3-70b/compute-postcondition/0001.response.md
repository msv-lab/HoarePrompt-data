The code `colors = list(map(int, input().split()))` accepts an input string, splits it into substrings separated by spaces, converts each substring to an integer using the `map` function, and then creates a list of these integers. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `colors` is a list of input integers**
