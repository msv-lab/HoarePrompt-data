Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i`, and the value associated with the key `color` (which is `colors[i]`) in `window_counts` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited; otherwise, no changes are made to `found` and the loop or if statement continues.***
