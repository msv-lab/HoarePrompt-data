Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is unchanged, `counts` is unchanged, `color_counts` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, `color` is the `j-th` element of the `colors` list, `window_counts` includes `color` with a count incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `found` remains unchanged.***
