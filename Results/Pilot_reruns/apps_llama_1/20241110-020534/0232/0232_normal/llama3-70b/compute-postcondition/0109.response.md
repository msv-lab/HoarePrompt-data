To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will execute again. 

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state does not explicitly state the relationship between `i` and `n`, but it does mention that if `i` is not less than `n`, the loop does not execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is less than `n`.

Additionally, since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop's execution is only dependent on the relationship between `i` and `n`.

State: **`found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the index where the match was found or `n`, `window_counts` contains the count of each color in the last window examined, `counts` is not empty, `colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`**
