To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The code snippet is: `color_counts[color] += 1`

From the initial state, we know that `color` is the third color in the `colors` list and `color_counts` is a dictionary that maps `color` to 0 if `color` was not already a key in `color_counts`, otherwise `color_counts` remains unchanged.

When we execute the code snippet, the value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.

Since `color_counts[color]` was initially 0 (because `color` was not already a key in `color_counts`), the new value of `color_counts[color]` will be 1.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 colors, `counts` is a list of integers, `color` is the third color in the `colors` list, and `color_counts` is a dictionary that maps `color` to 1.**
