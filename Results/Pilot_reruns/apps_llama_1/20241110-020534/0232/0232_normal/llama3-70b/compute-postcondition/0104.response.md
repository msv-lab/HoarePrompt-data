Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts, `color` is the `(i+2)`-th color in the `colors` list, the count of `color` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the target counts, then `found` is True and the loop breaks, otherwise `found` remains unchanged.***
