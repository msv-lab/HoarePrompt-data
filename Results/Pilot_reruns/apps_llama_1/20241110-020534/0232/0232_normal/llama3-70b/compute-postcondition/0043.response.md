The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is unchanged, `counts` is unchanged, `color_counts` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, `color` is the `j-th` element of the `colors` list, `window_counts` includes `color` with a count incremented by 1, and `found` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
