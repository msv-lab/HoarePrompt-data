Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts, and `found` is the flag indicating whether the counts match the targets. `window_counts` is a dictionary where the `i`-th color in the `colors` list is a key, and its value is either the initial count (if the color was already in the dictionary) or 0 (if the color was not in the dictionary).***
