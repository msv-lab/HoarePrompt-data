Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts, `color` is the `(i+2)`-th color in the `colors` list, and `found` remains unchanged. If the `(i+2)`-th color is not in the `window_counts` dictionary, the count of this color in `window_counts` is reset to 0, otherwise, the `window_counts` dictionary remains unchanged.***
