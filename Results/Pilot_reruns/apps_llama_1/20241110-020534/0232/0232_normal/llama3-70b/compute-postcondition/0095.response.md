We break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts, `found` is `True`, `color` is the `(i+1)`-th color in the `colors` list, `window_counts` dictionary has the count of the `(i+1)`-th color incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
