The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `right` is 2, so the color at index 2 is incremented by 1 in `current_counts`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the number of colors that have been decremented, `current_counts` reflect the updated counts with the color at index 1 incremented by 1 and the color at index 2 incremented by 1, `right` is 2, `n` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`left` is the number of colors that have been decremented, `current_counts` reflect the updated counts with the color at index 1 incremented by 1 and the color at index 2 incremented by 1, `right` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
