`left` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `colors` is a list of integers in the range {1, 2,..., m} of length `n`, `k` is a list of positive integers of length `m` such that 1 <= sum(k) <= n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from 1 to `m` and the values are the corresponding elements in `k`, `current_counts` is a dictionary with default value 0 for each key, and `left` is 0.
