To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is `res += char`. This means the value of `char` will be appended to the end of the string `res`.

From the initial state, we know that `char` is 'z'. 

If 'a' is in `s`, then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by all the characters from 'b' to 'z' in sequence. After appending 'z' to `res`, the sequence of characters from 'b' to 'z' will still be maintained, but 'z' will be duplicated at the end.

If 'a' is not in `s`, then `res` is the string of all characters from 'b' to 'z' in sequence. After appending 'z' to `res`, the sequence of characters from 'b' to 'z' will still be maintained, but 'z' will be duplicated at the end.

In both cases, `s`, `alphabet`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: If 'a' is in `s`, then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by all the characters from 'b' to 'z' in sequence and an additional 'z' at the end, `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, 'y' replaced by 'z', and all the characters from 'b' to 'x' replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and `char` is 'z'. If 'a' is not in `s`, then `res` is the string of all characters from 'b' to 'z' in sequence and an additional 'z' at the end, `s` is the input string with 'y' replaced by 'z', and all the characters from 'b' to 'x' replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and `char` is 'z'.

Output State: **If 'a' is in `s`, then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by all the characters from 'b' to 'z' in sequence and an additional 'z' at the end, `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, 'y' replaced by 'z', and all the characters from 'b' to 'x' replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and `char` is 'z'. If 'a' is not in `s`, then `res` is the string of all characters from 'b' to 'z' in sequence and an additional 'z' at the end, `s` is the input string with 'y' replaced by 'z', and all the characters from 'b' to 'x' replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and `char` is 'z'.**
