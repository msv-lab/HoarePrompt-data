Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of the string `res`. 

If 'a' is in `s`, then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by 'b'. So, `res` ends with 'b'. Now, `char` is 'b', so `res` will end with 'bb'.

If 'a' is not in `s`, then `res` is 'b'. Now, `char` is 'b', so `res` will be 'bb'.

In both cases, `s` remains the same because it is not modified by the code. The same applies to `alphabet` and `char`.

Therefore, the Output State is: If 'a' is in `s`, then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by 'bb', `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's and the first 'b' replaced by 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `char` is 'b'. If 'a' is not in `s`, then `res` is 'bb', `s` is the input string with the first 'b' replaced by 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `char` is 'b'.
Output State: **If 'a' is in `s`, then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by 'bb', `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's and the first 'b' replaced by 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `char` is 'b'. If 'a' is not in `s`, then `res` is 'bb', `s` is the input string with the first 'b' replaced by 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `char` is 'b'.**
