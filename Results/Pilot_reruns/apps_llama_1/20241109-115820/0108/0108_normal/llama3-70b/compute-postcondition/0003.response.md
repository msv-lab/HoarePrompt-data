To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. In this case, the loop iterates over the `alphabet` string. 

The loop will execute if the `alphabet` string is not empty. Since `alphabet` is already given as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which is not empty, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to consider the state of the loop variable `char`.

At the start of the loop, `char` should be the first character of the `alphabet` string, which is 'a'.

The states of `s` and `res` do not affect the execution of the loop, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
