The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. The initial value of `res` is 'ab', and `char` is 'b'. Therefore, the new value of `res` is 'abb'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced with 'c' and 'b' is still present in `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'.**
