`s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character after `char` in the alphabet, since `ord(char) + 1` gives the ASCII value of the next character in the alphabet. The value of `char` is 'a', so it is replaced with 'b'. The values of `alphabet` and `res` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced with 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced with 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.**
