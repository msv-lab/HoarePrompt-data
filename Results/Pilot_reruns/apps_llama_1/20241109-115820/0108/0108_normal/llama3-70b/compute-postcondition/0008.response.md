`s` is assigned the value of `s` with the first occurrence of `char` replaced with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The value of `char` is 'b', so `ord(char)` is 98 and `chr(ord(char) + 1)` is 'c'. Therefore, the first 'b' in `s` is replaced with 'c'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced with 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'.**
