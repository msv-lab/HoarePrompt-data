Output State: **`if s contains char then res` accumulates characters from 'a' up to but not including the first character not found in `s`, `s` has its characters shifted one position forward in the alphabet, replacing each occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, until `char` is not found in `s`. `alphabet` remains unchanged. If `s` does not contain `char` initially, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains empty, `s` remains unchanged. `char` is the first character not found in `s` after the loop execution.**

In this output state, I have considered the following:

* If `s` contains `char`, the loop will execute, and `res` will accumulate characters from 'a' up to but not including the first character not found in `s`.
* `s` will have its characters shifted one position forward in the alphabet, replacing each occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, until `char` is not found in `s`.
* `alphabet` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
* If `s` does not contain `char` initially, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains empty, `s` remains unchanged.
* `char` is the first character not found in `s` after the loop execution.

I have also considered the edge cases where `s` does not contain `char` initially, and the loop does not execute.
