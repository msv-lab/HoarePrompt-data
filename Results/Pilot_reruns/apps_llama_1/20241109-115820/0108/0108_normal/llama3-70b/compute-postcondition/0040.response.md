Postcondition: ***The input string `s` is empty. If `res` contains all 26 characters from the `alphabet` in alphabetical order, `res` is printed and remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `res` does not contain all 26 characters, the function prints -1 and `res` remains unchanged, potentially empty if `s` did not contain any characters from the `alphabet`. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged throughout the execution.***
