Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The program iterates over each character in the alphabet.
2. For each character, it checks if the character exists in the input string `s`. If it does, it adds the character to the result string `res` and replaces the first occurrence of the character in `s` with the next character in alphabetical order. This ensures that the character is "moved" to the next position in the alphabet.
3. The program repeats step 2 until all characters in the alphabet have been processed.
4. If the length of the result string `res` is 26, it means that all characters in the alphabet have been found in the input string `s` and have been "moved" to their correct positions. In this case, the program prints the result string `res`.
5. If the length of the result string `res` is not 26, it means that not all characters in the alphabet could be found in the input string `s` or could not be "moved" to their correct positions. In this case, the program prints -1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the input string `s` contains all characters in the alphabet, the program correctly "moves" them to their correct positions and prints the alphabet.
* When the input string `s` does not contain all characters in the alphabet, the program correctly prints -1.
* When the input string `s` contains duplicate characters, the program correctly "moves" them to their correct positions and prints the alphabet.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
