The function accepts three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, where 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It calculates the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, modulo `MOD`, and returns the result. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0. The function's behavior is dependent on the implementation of `func_1` and the value of `MOD`.
