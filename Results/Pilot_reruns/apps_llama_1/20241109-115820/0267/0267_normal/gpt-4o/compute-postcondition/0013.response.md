Let's break it down step by step:

The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. 

* `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, which means `l` and `r` are positive integers where `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and both are less than 10^18.
* `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, which means `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive).

The function returns a value called `total_sum`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` within a certain range and an integer `k` between 1 and 10, and return a calculated `total_sum` based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` where 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and an integer `k` where 1 <= k <= 10, and returns a calculated `total_sum`.**
