To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.


Initial State: `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`


The code snippet is: 
```
total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
```


The value of `total_sum` is not provided in the initial state, so it can be any integer. The value of `num` is `l + 1`. The value of `MOD` is not provided, so it can be any integer.


After executing the code, `total_sum` is assigned the value `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Since `num` is `l + 1`, we can substitute this value into the expression. However, the exact value of `total_sum` and `MOD` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `total_sum`.


The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by the code.


Therefore, the output state is: `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`.


Output State: **`l` is `l + 1`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD**
