Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition func_1(num, k), and stores it in total_sum. The sum is calculated modulo MOD. If no numbers in the range satisfy the condition, total_sum remains 0. If l is greater than r, the loop does not execute and total_sum remains 0. In all cases, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.**

Note: The output state includes the cases where the loop does not execute, which are when l is greater than r, or when no numbers in the range satisfy the condition func_1(num, k). In these cases, total_sum remains 0.
