To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is `num in range(l, r + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is `l + 1`, `l` is `l + 1` (which means the new value of `l` is the old value of `l` plus 1), `r` is greater than `l`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `num` is `l + 1` and `l` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `num` should be the old value of `num` plus 1, which is `l + 2`.

The state of `r` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num` is less than or equal to `r`. Since `r` is greater than `l`, it should be greater than or equal to `l + 2` to allow the loop to execute one more time.

The state of `k` remains unchanged, as it is not related to the loop condition.

The state of `total_sum` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`l` is `l + 1`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is `l + 2`, `total_sum` is unchanged**
