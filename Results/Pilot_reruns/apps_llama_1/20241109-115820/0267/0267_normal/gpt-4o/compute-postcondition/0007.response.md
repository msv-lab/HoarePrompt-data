To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the loop condition and the updates made to the variables in the previous iteration.

The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was updated to `l + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `num` should be less than or equal to `r`.

Since `num` is now `l + 1`, we can infer that `l` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration. Therefore, `l` is now `l + 1`.

The state of `r` remains the same, as it is not updated in the loop body.

The state of `k` remains the same, as it is not updated in the loop body.

The state of `total_sum` is updated based on the value of `func_1(num, k)`, but its exact value is not relevant to the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`l` is `l + 1`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`**
