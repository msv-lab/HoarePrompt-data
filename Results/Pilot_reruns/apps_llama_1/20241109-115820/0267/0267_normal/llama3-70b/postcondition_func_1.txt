The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k` such that `k` <= 10, and a data structure `dp`. It returns the corresponding value from `dp` for the pair `(n, k)` if it exists, or calculates and stores the value in `dp` using a formula if `n` is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of `k`. However, the function's behavior is unspecified for `k` greater than 10, negative `n`, or invalid `dp`.
