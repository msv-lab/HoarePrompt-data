Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

Initially, the code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and returns the result modulo `MOD`. The function `count` calculates the count of numbers less than or equal to `n` with at most `k` different digits.

The output hints agree with the code and do not provide any cases that the code might not be handling. The function `count` handles the case when `n` is less than `10 ** k` and the case when `n` is greater than or equal to `10 ** k`. The function also handles the case when `k` is 0.

The code uses dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems, which makes it efficient. The use of modulo `MOD` ensures that the result does not overflow.

After carefully examining the code and the output hints, I could not find any edge cases that the code might not be handling. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Note: The code assumes that the input values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are valid, i.e., `1 <= l <= r < 10 ** 18` and `1 <= k <= 10`. If the input values can be invalid, additional error checking code may be necessary.
