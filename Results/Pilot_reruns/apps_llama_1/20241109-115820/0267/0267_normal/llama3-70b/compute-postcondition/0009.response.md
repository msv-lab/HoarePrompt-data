To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The code is: `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10
- `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 90 to slightly less than 9 billion
- `i` is 2

Now, let's calculate the value of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`:

- `i - 1` is 1
- `10 ** (i - 1)` is 10
- `k - i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 8 (since `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10, and `i` is 2)
- `10 ** (k - i)` is a power of 10, greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 10^8
- `10 ** (i - 1)` is 10
- `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` is a value greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 10^8 - 10

Now, let's calculate the value of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`:

- `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)` is 90
- `90 * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` is a value greater than or equal to 900 and less than or equal to 9 * 10^8 - 900

Now, let's calculate the new value of `dp[n, k]`:

- `dp[n, k]` is increased by a value greater than or equal to 900 and less than or equal to 9 * 10^8 - 900

The output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 990 to slightly less than 9 billion, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 990 to slightly less than 9 billion, `i` is 2**
