Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer such that k <= 10. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, the dictionary dp has a new key-value pair (n, k) with value n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is calculated as a value in the range of 0 to MOD - 1 using the given formula, which considers the cases where n is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of k, and the result is stored in dp[n, k] modulo MOD. In both cases, if the pair (n, k) exists in dp, the function returns the corresponding value dp[n, k]; otherwise, the function's behavior is unspecified for the given values of k, but it does not return 0.***
