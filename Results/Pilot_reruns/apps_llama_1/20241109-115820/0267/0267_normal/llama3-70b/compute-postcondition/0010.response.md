To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```
for i in range(1, k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` should still be greater than the new value of `i`. 

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 990 to slightly less than 9 billion, `i` is 3**
