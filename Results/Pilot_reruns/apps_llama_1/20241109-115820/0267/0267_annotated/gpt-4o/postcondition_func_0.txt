The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, and returns True if the number of unique digits in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`, False otherwise. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is a negative integer, a non-integer value, or a non-string value, and may raise a TypeError or produce unexpected results in these cases.
