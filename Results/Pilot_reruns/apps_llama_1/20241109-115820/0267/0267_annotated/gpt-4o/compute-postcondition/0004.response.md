To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is `num in range(l, r + 1)`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is equal to `l`. For the loop to execute again, `num` must be incremented to the next value in the range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num`, which should be incremented to `l + 1`.

The other states, `l`, `r`, `k`, `total_sum`, and the conditions on `l`, `r`, and `k`, do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`, If `func_1(l, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is `l % MOD` and `l` is the previous value of `num`. If `func_1(l, k)` returns False, then `total_sum` remains 0 and `l` is the previous value of `num`.**
