To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is as follows:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10
- `num` is `l + 1`
- If `func_1(l, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is `l % MOD` and `l` is the previous value of `num`
- If `func_1(l, k)` returns False, then `total_sum` remains 0 and `l` is the previous value of `num`

The given code is:
```python
total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
```

The impact of the code on the program is that it updates the value of `total_sum`. 

Since `num` is `l + 1` and the previous value of `total_sum` depends on the return value of `func_1(l, k)`, we have two possible scenarios:

1. If `func_1(l, k)` returns True, then the previous value of `total_sum` is `l % MOD`. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` is `(l % MOD + l + 1) % MOD`.

2. If `func_1(l, k)` returns False, then the previous value of `total_sum` is 0. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` is `(0 + l + 1) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 1) % MOD`.

The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by the given code. The value of `num` is also not updated in the given code.

Therefore, the output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is either `(l % MOD + l + 1) % MOD` or `(l + 1) % MOD` depending on the return value of `func_1(l, k)`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is either `(l % MOD + l + 1) % MOD` or `(l + 1) % MOD` depending on the return value of `func_1(l, k)`.**
