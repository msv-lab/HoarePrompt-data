To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the range specified in the `for` loop statement, which is `range(l, r + 1)`. This implies that the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` and `r` are already constrained to be within certain ranges (1 <= l <= r < 10^18), and `k` and `total_sum` do not directly affect the loop's execution, we focus on the relationship between `l` and `r`.

Given that `l` and `r` are integers and 1 <= l <= r, for the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `num` (the loop variable) is initialized to `l`, since that's the starting point of the range.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
