To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `for num in range(l, r + 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`.

In the current state, `num` is `l + 2`, which is greater than `l`. For the loop to execute again, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `num` is `l + 2`, we can infer that `l + 2` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `r`, which must be greater than or equal to `l + 2` for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, since `num` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `num` at the start of the next iteration will be `l + 3`.

The other states, `k` and `total_sum`, do not depend on the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is the previous value of `num` plus 1, `r` is an integer such that `l + 2` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is `l + 3`. If `func_1(num, k)` is true, `total_sum` is either `((l % MOD + l + 3) + l + 3) % MOD`, `((l + 3) + l + 3) % MOD`, or `(l + 3) % MOD`. Otherwise, `total_sum` remains either `(l % MOD + l + 3) % MOD`, `(l + 3) % MOD`, or 0.**
