Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` does not handle cases where `n` is a negative integer, a non-integer value, or a non-string value, and may raise a TypeError or produce unexpected results in these cases. However, this is not the main issue.

The main issue is that the function `func_2` does not calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, but instead calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, which is not the same thing.

For example, if `l = 10`, `r = 20`, and `k = 2`, the function `func_2` will return the sum of numbers from `10` to `20` that have at most `2` different digits, but it will not include numbers like `11`, `22`, etc., which have only one digit but are still within the range.

The function `func_2` should be modified to correctly calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.

Additionally, the problem description provides examples that the code should be able to handle, but the code does not provide any error checking or handling for cases where `l` is greater than `r`, or where `k` is less than `1` or greater than `10`. These cases should be handled to ensure the code is correct.
