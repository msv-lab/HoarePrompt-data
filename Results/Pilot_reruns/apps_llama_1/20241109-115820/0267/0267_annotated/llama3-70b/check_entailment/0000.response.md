Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description. 

The problem description requires the program to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (including `l` and `r`) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and print this sum modulo `998244353`. However, the code does not correctly calculate this sum.

The function `count(n, k, dp)` is supposed to calculate the count of numbers less than or equal to `n` with at most `k` different digits. However, the code only calculates the count of numbers less than or equal to `n` with exactly `k` different digits. 

For example, when `n = 100` and `k = 2`, the function `count(n, k, dp)` should return the count of numbers less than or equal to `100` with at most `2` different digits, which includes numbers like `11`, `22`, `33`,..., `99`, `101`, `110`, `111`,..., `199`. However, the code only calculates the count of numbers less than or equal to `100` with exactly `2` different digits, which only includes numbers like `11`, `22`, `33`,..., `99`.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
