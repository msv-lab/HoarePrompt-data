The function returns `dp[n, k]`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer, and `dp` is a dictionary. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.**
