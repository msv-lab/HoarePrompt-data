To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
```
From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10.
- `dp` is a dictionary where `dp[n, k]` is 9.
- `i` is 1.

Given `i` is 1, let's substitute `i` in the equation:
```python
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (1 - 1) * (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (1 - 1))
```
This simplifies to:
```python
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** 0 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** 0)
```
Since `10 ** 0` is 1, the equation further simplifies to:
```python
dp[n, k] += 9 * 1 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
```
Which is:
```python
dp[n, k] += 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
```
Given that `dp[n, k]` initially is 9, the new value of `dp[n, k]` will be:
```python
dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
```
Since `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10, let's consider the range of values for `10 ** (k - 1)`:
- For `k = 2`, `10 ** (k - 1)` is `10 ** 1` which is 10.
- For `k = 10`, `10 ** (k - 1)` is `10 ** 9`.

So, `10 ** (k - 1)` ranges from 10 to `10 ** 9`. Therefore, `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)` will be a multiple of 9, ranging from 81 (when `k = 2`) to a very large number (when `k = 10`).

The value of `dp[n, k]` after the operation will be `9 + 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`, which is a multiple of 9 plus 9.

Considering the initial state and the operation performed, the output state is:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `k` remains an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10.
- `dp[n, k]` is now a value that is a multiple of 9 plus 9, which is still a multiple of 9 but greater than the initial value by a multiple of 9.
- `i` remains 1.

However, given the specific operation and the fact that `dp[n, k]` is being updated based on `k` and `i`, and considering `i` is 1, the output state simplifies to focusing on the change in `dp[n, k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is 9 + 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1), `i` is 1**
