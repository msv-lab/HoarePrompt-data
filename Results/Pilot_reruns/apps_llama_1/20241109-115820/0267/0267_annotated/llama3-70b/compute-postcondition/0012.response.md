According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is at least 1 since it's the end of the previous iteration. `k` is an integer such that 4 <= k <= 10. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, since it starts from 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 4 <= k <= 10, `i` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is 10 + 9 * 10**
