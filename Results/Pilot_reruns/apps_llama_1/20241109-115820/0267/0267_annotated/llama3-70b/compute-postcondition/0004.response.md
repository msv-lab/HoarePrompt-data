The value of `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. The state of `n` and `k` remains the same. The function does not return any value. The output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary where `dp[n, k]` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary where `dp[n, k]` is `n`.**
