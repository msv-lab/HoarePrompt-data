The value of `dp[n, k]` is increased by `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. However, the value of `i` is unknown. Since `k` is between 4 and 10, and `i` is likely related to `k`, let's assume `i` is an integer between 1 and `k`. The value of `dp[n, k]` can be calculated as follows:

`dp[n, k]` is initially 10
`dp[n, k]` is increased by `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`

Since `i` is unknown, the exact value of `dp[n, k]` cannot be determined. However, we can express the new value of `dp[n, k]` in terms of `i` and `k`.

The values of `n` and `k` are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 4 <= k <= 10, and `dp[n, k]` is 10 + 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)), where i is an integer between 1 and k.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 4 <= k <= 10, and `dp[n, k]` is 10 + 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)), where i is an integer between 1 and k.**
