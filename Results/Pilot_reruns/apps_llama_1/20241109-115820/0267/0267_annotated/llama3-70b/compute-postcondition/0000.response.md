The function returns 0. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary, and the function returns 0**
