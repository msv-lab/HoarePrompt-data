Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (including `l` and `r`) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and print this sum modulo `998244353`. However, the code does not handle the case where `l` is greater than `r`. In this case, the function `func_2` returns 0, which is incorrect.

According to the problem description, the function should return the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (including `l` and `r`) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, taken modulo `998244353`. However, the code does not handle the case where `l` is greater than `r`, and instead returns 0.

The annotations in the code also mention that if `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. However, this is not correct, as the function should return the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (including `l` and `r`) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, taken modulo `998244353`, even if `l` is greater than `r`.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
