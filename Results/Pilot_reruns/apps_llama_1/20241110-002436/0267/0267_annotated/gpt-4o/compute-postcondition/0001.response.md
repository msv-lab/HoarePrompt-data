To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the range specified in the `for` loop statement, which is `range(l, r + 1)`. This implies that the loop will iterate over all integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` and `r` are already constrained to be within certain ranges (`1 <= l <= r < 10^18`), we need to ensure that `l` is indeed less than or equal to `r` for the loop to have at least one iteration.

Given that `l` and `r` are integers and `l <= r`, and considering the constraints provided, the loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. The value of `k` and `total_sum` does not affect the execution of the loop in this context.

However, to align with the format of specifying states before the loop starts, we acknowledge that `num` (the loop variable) will take on the value of `l` at the start of the first iteration. Thus, we specify the state of `num` as being equal to `l` to reflect the initial condition of the loop.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`**
