To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given state.

The loop condition is `num in range(l, r + 1)`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18
* `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10
* `num` is equal to `l + 1`
* `total_sum` is either `(l + 1) % MOD` or `(total_sum + 2*l + 1) % MOD`, or remains unchanged, either 0 or `(total_sum + l) % MOD`

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* `num` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range.
* Since `num` is equal to `l + 1`, we need to increment `l` to make `num` equal to `l + 2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` + 1 <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is equal to `l + 2`, `total_sum` is either `(l + 1) % MOD` or `(total_sum + 2*l + 1) % MOD`, or remains unchanged, either 0 or `(total_sum + l) % MOD**
