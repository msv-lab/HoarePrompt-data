To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `num` is in the range `[l, r + 1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 2`. 

For the loop to execute again, `num` should be equal to `l + 3`. The state of `l` and `r` also needs to be adjusted to ensure that `l + 3` is within the range `[l, r + 1]`. This means `r` should be greater than or equal to `l + 3`.

The state of `k` remains the same, as it is not affected by the loop condition.

The state of `total_sum` is not directly affected by the loop condition, but it may have changed in the previous iteration. However, we do not need to adjust its state, as it is not relevant to the loop condition.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` + 1 <= `r` >= `l` + 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is `l + 3**
