To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The code is: `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`

From the initial state, we know that `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, `dp[n, k]` is 9, and `i` is 1.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. `10 ** (i - 1)` is `10 ** 0` which is 1.
2. `10 ** (k - i)` is `10 ** (k - 1)`, but we don't know the exact value of `k`, so we'll leave it as is.
3. `10 ** (i - 1)` is `10 ** 0` which is 1.
4. The expression inside the parentheses is `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)`, which simplifies to `10 ** (k - 1) - 1`.
5. Multiply `9` by `10 ** (i - 1)`, which is `9 * 1`, resulting in `9`.
6. Multiply `9` by the expression inside the parentheses, resulting in `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.
7. Add the result to `dp[n, k]`, which is initially 9.

So, the new value of `dp[n, k]` is `9 + 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.

The output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, `dp[n, k]` is `9 + 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, `dp[n, k]` is `9 + 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`, and `i` is 1**
