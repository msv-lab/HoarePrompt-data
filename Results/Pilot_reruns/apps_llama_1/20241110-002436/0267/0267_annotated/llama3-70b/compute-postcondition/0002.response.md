The function returns `dp[n, k]`, which is a value from the dictionary `dp`. The value of `dp[n, k]` is a non-negative integer. The values of `n`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, and the function returns a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, and the function returns a non-negative integer**
