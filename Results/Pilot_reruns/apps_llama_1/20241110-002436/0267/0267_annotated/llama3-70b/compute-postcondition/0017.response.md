The function returns `dp[n, k]`, and the value of `dp[n, k]` depends on the values of `n`, `k`, and `dp`. The value of `dp[n, k]` is already calculated and stored in the dictionary `dp`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.**
