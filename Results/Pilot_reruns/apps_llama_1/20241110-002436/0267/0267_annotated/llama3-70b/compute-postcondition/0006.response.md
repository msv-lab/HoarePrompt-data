To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that must be met for the loop to start. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `k`, exclusive of `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state, we know `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10. For the loop to execute, we need to adjust this state so that `k` is at least 2 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `k`). Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, its initial value before the loop starts executing would be the first value in the range, which is 1.

The state of `n` being a non-negative integer and `dp` being a dictionary with `dp[n, k]` being 9 does not directly affect the loop's execution condition based on the provided loop statement. However, these conditions could affect the loop body's behavior or the overall program logic, but they do not influence whether the loop will execute or not based on the loop statement provided.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes would be:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
