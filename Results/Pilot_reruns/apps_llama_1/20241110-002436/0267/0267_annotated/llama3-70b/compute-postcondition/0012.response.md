To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is `range(1, k)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is an integer greater than 3.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can assume that `i` is the loop variable, and its initial value is 1 (since the range starts from 1).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 (assuming it's the first iteration) or `i` is 2 (if it's the second iteration). To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2 or 3, respectively.

However, the state of `k` also needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. Since `k` is an integer greater than 3, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer greater than the new value of `i`, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, `dp[n, k]` is `9 + 9 * 10`**

Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can assume that `i` is the loop variable, and its initial value is 1. After the first iteration, `i` becomes 2. Therefore, `k` should be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, `dp[n, k]` is `9 + 9 * 10`**

Note that the value of `dp[n, k]` remains the same, as it is not affected by the loop iteration.
