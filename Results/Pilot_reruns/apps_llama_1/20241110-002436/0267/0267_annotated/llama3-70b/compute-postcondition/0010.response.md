According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is equal to `k-1` since the loop iterates from 1 to `k`. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented, so it should be `k`. However, this would mean that `i` is no longer less than `k`, so the loop would not execute again. But since we are asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than its current value.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer greater than 3, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, `dp[n, k]` is `9 + 9 * (10**k - 1) // 9`**
