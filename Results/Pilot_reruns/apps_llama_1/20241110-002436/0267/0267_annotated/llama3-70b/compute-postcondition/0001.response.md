Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers. If k is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function's behavior is unspecified, but the values of n, k, and dp remain unchanged.***
