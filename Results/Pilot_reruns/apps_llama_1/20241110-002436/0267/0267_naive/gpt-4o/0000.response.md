Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the problem description. It defines two functions: `func_1` checks if a given number `n` has at most `k` different digits, and `func_2` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits. The program then reads the input values `l`, `r`, and `k`, and prints the result of `func_2` modulo `998244353`.

The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It iterates over all numbers in the given range, checks each number's digit diversity using `func_1`, and adds the number to the total sum if it meets the condition. The use of the modulo operation ensures that the result does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The examples provided in the problem statement also match the expected output of the program.

However, it's worth noting that the program's efficiency could be improved for large input ranges, as it has a time complexity of O(r-l). A more efficient solution might involve using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques. Nevertheless, the program's correctness is not affected by its efficiency.
