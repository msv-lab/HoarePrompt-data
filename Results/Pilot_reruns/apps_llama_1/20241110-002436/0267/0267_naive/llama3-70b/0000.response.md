Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the `count` function, which calculates the number of numbers with at most `k` different digits up to `n`. The function uses a dynamic programming approach with memoization, but it does not handle the case where `n` is a power of 10 (e.g., 10, 100, 1000, etc.) correctly.

When `n` is a power of 10, the function `count(n, k, dp)` returns `n`, which is incorrect. For example, when `n = 10` and `k = 1`, the function should return 9 (the numbers 1, 2,..., 9), not 10.

This error propagates to the `func_1` function, which calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` with at most `k` different digits. As a result, the program produces incorrect results for certain inputs.

To fix this issue, the `count` function should be modified to handle the case where `n` is a power of 10 correctly. One possible solution is to add a special case for powers of 10, where the function returns `n - 1` instead of `n`.

Here's an example of how the `count` function could be modified:
```python
def count(n, k, dp):
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    if (n, k) in dp:
        return dp[n, k]
    if n < 10 ** k:
        if n % 10 == 0:  # handle powers of 10
            dp[n, k] = n - 1
        else:
            dp[n, k] = n
    else:
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    return dp[n, k]
```
With this modification, the program should produce correct results for all inputs.
