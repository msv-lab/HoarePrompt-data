To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `num` is in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive). Since `num` is an integer and the loop iterates over the range `range(l, r + 1)`, the next value of `num` will be the current value of `num` plus 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is equal to `l`. For the loop to execute again, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to be `l + 1`.

The state of `total_sum` and `k` does not affect the loop condition, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0 or `l % MOD`, `num` is `l + 1`.**
