The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers that represent the left and right boundaries of a range, respectively, where 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18. `k` is an integer that serves as a parameter for another function `func_1`, where 1 <= `k` <= 10.

After executing the function body, the function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, modulo MOD.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l, r, and k, and returns the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition func_1(num, k), modulo MOD.**
