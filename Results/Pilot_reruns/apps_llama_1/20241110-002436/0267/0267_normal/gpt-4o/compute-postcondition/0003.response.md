Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After the execution, if `func_1(num, k)` returns True, `total_sum` is equal to `l % MOD` and `num` remains equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns False, the state of the program variables remains unchanged, i.e., `total_sum` is 0 and `num` is equal to `l`.***
