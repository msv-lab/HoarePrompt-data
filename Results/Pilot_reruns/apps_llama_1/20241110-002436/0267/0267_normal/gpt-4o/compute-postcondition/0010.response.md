To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `num` is in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l + 1 <= r < 10^18`. This implies that the loop has already executed for `num = l`. For the loop to execute again, `num` should be the next integer after `l`, which is `l + 1`.

Since `l` and `r` are integers, and `l + 1` is still within the range defined by `r`, we can conclude that `l` needs to be adjusted to `l + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

The other states (`k`, `total_sum`, and the condition `func_1(l + 1, k)`) do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l + 1 <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is either `((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD`, `(((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD + l + 1) % MOD`, `(l + 1) % MOD`, or `((l % MOD) + l + 1) % MOD` if `func_1(l + 1, k)` is true, or 0 or `l % MOD` if `func_1(l + 1, k)` is false, `r` is an integer greater than `l`**
