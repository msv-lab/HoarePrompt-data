Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I understand that the function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= 10`.

The function calculates the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, modulo `MOD`. If no numbers in the range satisfy the condition, the function returns `0`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns `0` without executing the loop.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the annotations do not explicitly mention what happens when `l` is equal to `r`. In this case, the loop executes once, and the function returns either `l % MOD` or `0`, depending on the result of `func_1(l, k)`.

Additionally, the annotations do not mention what happens when `func_1(num, k)` returns `True` for all numbers in the range `[l, r]`. In this case, the function returns the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]`, modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, and an integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= 10`. It returns the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, modulo `MOD`. If no numbers in the range satisfy the condition, it returns `0`. If `l` is greater than `r`, it returns `0`. If `l` is equal to `r`, it returns either `l % MOD` or `0`, depending on the result of `func_1(l, k)`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns `True` for all numbers in the range `[l, r]`, it returns the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]`, modulo `MOD`. **
