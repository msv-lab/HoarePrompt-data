Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the program seems to be correct. It appears to be calculating the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that have at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the program uses a brute force approach by iterating over all numbers in the range `[l, r]`. This might be inefficient for large ranges, but it does not seem to be incorrect.

The output hints seem to agree with the code. They describe the behavior of the functions correctly, and they do not mention any cases that the code does not handle.

After re-examining the code and the output hints, I did not find any cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that have at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. It uses a brute force approach, but it is correct and efficient for the given constraints. The output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected, and I did not find any edge cases that the program does not handle.
