The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` equals 0, the corresponding value `dp[n, k]` if `(n, k)` is a key in `dp`, and a calculated value based on `n` and `k` otherwise, which is a value between 0 and MOD-1, where MOD is an unspecified positive integer. However, the function's behavior is unspecified if `k` is greater than 10, and the value of `dp[n, k]` might not be valid in this case.
