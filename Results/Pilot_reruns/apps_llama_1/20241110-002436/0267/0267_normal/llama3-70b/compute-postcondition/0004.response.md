The value of `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. The state of `k` remains unchanged, and it remains a positive integer such that `k <= 10`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and it remains a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= 10`, `dp` is a dictionary with the key `(n, k)` and its corresponding value is `n`**
