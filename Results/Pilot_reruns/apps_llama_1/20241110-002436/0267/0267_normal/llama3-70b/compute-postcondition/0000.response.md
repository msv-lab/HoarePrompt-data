The function returns 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `dp` do not change, so the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns 0**
