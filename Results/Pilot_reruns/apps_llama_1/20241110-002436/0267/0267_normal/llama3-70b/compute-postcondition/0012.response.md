To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, k):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. 

Given the current state: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 2 and `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with the value for key `(n, k)` increased by a positive amount dependent on `k`, and `i` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently 3, `k` must be greater than 3. The current state already ensures that `k` > 2, but to guarantee another iteration, we need to adjust the state of `k` to be greater than 3.

Additionally, since `i` is 3, it should be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.

The states of `n` and `dp` do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 3 and `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with the value for key `(n, k)` increased by a positive amount dependent on `k`, and `i` is 4**
