The function returns the value of `dp[n, k]`, which is a dictionary lookup. The values of `n`, `k`, and `dp` do not change, so the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.**
