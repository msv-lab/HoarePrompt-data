After reviewing the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. It checks the conditions for the sequence and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

However, I do notice that the code does not handle the case where `c` is negative. In this case, the sequence would decrease by `c` for each subsequent element, and the condition `(b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0` might not be sufficient to determine if `b` is in the sequence.

The output hints seem to agree with the code, but they do not provide any additional information that would suggest the code is incorrect.

After further review, I realize that the code actually handles the case where `c` is negative correctly. The condition `(b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0` is sufficient to determine if `b` is in the sequence, even when `c` is negative. This is because the modulo operation and division operation in Python work correctly with negative numbers.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks the conditions for the sequence and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. It handles all cases, including when `c` is negative, and the conditions are sufficient to determine if `b` is in the sequence.
