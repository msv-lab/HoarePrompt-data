The function func does not accept any parameters, but it seems like it should accept three integer parameters a, b, and c. 

The function reads three integers from the input and stores them in a, b, and c. 

If c is 0, the function checks if a is equal to b and prints 'YES' if they are equal, and 'NO' otherwise.

If c is not 0, the function checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise.

However, the function does not return any value, it only prints the result to the console.

Functionality: ** The function reads three integers from the input, checks the conditions based on the values of the integers, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console accordingly, but does not return any value. **
