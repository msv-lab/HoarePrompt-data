Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `c` is 0, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is equal to `b`, and 'NO' is printed otherwise. If `c` is not 0, then 'YES' is printed if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, otherwise 'NO' is printed.***
