Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence `s`. Here's why:

1. If `b` is equal to the first element `a`, it prints "YES" because `b` is indeed in the sequence.
2. If the difference `c` is 0, it prints "NO" because the sequence will be constant and `b` will not appear in it unless `b` is equal to `a`, which is already handled in the first condition.
3. If the difference `c` is non-zero, it checks if `(b - a)` is a multiple of `c` and if the result is non-negative. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES" because `b` will appear in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If `c` is positive, it checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `a` and if the difference is a multiple of `c`.
* If `c` is negative, it checks if `b` is less than or equal to `a` and if the difference is a multiple of `c`.
* If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints "YES" regardless of the value of `c`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
