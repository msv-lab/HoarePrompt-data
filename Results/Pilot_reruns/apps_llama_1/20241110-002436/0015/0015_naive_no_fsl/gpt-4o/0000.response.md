Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether the number `b` appears in the sequence `s` with the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Here's why:

1. If `b` is equal to `a`, then `b` is the first element of the sequence, so the program correctly prints 'YES'.

2. If `c` is equal to 0, then all elements of the sequence are equal to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a`, then `b` does not appear in the sequence, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.

3. If `c` is not equal to 0, then the program checks whether the difference `b - a` is a multiple of `c` and whether the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. If both conditions are true, then `b` appears in the sequence, so the program correctly prints 'YES'. Otherwise, `b` does not appear in the sequence, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, including the case where `c` is negative (in which case the sequence decreases instead of increases). 

Therefore, the program is correct for all possible inputs, and the Correctness is **True**.
