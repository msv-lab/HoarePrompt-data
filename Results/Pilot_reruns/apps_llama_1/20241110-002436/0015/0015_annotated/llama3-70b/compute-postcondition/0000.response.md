The code uses the `map` function to apply the `int` function to each element of the input, which is split into a list of strings using the `split` method. The resulting list of integers is then unpacked and assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are initially integers, their values will be overwritten with the new values obtained from the input.

The output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers**
