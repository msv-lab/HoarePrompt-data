Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `c` is zero, 'YES' is printed if `a` equals `b`, and 'NO' is printed otherwise. If `c` is non-zero, 'YES' is printed if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, and 'NO' is printed otherwise, covering all cases including division by zero errors and negative results.***
