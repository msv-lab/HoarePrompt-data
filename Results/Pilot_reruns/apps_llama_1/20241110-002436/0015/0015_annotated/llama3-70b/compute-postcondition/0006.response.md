Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, covering all cases including when `c` is zero, which would result in a division by zero error, and when the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c` or the result is negative.***
