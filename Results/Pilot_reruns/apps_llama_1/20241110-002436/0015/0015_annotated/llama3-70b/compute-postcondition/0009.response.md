The function func does not accept any parameters. It takes three integers as input from the user, denoted as a, b, and c. 

The function first checks if c is zero. If c is zero, it then checks if a equals b. If a equals b, it prints 'YES' to the console. If a does not equal b, it prints 'NO' to the console.

If c is not zero, it checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and if the result is non-negative. If the difference is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES' to the console. If the difference is not divisible by c or the result is negative, it prints 'NO' to the console.

However, there are no return statements in the function, so the return value is unknown. The function only prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console.

Functionality: ** The function takes three integers as input from the user, and based on certain conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console, but does not return any value. **
