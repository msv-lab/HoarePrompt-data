The function takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input from the user and prints 'YES' if `b` equals `a`, or if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative. It prints 'NO' in all other cases, including when `c` is zero, the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`, or the result of the division is negative. However, if `c` is zero and the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`, the function will still print 'NO', although the annotations suggest that it should print 'NO' only when `c` is zero.
