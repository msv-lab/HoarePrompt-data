Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I have analyzed the function's functionality as follows:

The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input from the user. The function then checks the following conditions:

1. If `b` equals `a`, it prints 'YES'.
2. If `c` is zero, it prints 'NO'.
3. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES'.
4. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the annotations suggest that the function checks if `b` equals `a` first, and if not, it checks the other conditions. But the code actually checks these conditions sequentially, without any prioritization.

Moreover, the annotations imply that the function covers all cases, including when `c` is zero, the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`, or the result of the division is negative. However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where `c` is zero and the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`. In this case, the code will still print 'NO', but the annotations suggest that it should print 'NO' only when `c` is zero.

Taking these observations into account, I conclude that the functionality of the function is as follows:

Functionality: ** The function takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input from the user and prints 'YES' if `b` equals `a`, or if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative. It prints 'NO' in all other cases, including when `c` is zero, the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`, or the result of the division is negative. However, if `c` is zero and the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`, the function will still print 'NO', although the annotations suggest that it should print 'NO' only when `c` is zero. **
