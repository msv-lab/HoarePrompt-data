`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, converted to integers by the `int` function and split by the `split` function. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown, so the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers**
