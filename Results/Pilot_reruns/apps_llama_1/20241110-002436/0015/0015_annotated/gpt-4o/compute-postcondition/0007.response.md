Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. The program prints 'YES' if `b` equals `a`, or if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative. Otherwise, it prints 'NO', covering all cases including when `c` is zero, the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`, or the result of the division is negative.***
