Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, then 'YES' is printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, which covers the cases where `c` is zero, the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`, or the result of the division is negative.***
