The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user to input a string, and checks if the input string contains all 26 letters of the alphabet at least once. If it does, the function prints the letters in alphabetical order. If it does not, the function prints -1. The function does not handle cases where the input string contains uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters, and will include them in the remaining string. The function also does not handle empty input strings and will print -1 in such cases.
