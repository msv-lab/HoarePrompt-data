To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet.

The code snippet is `s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)`. 

Here, `s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced by 'b' and contains at least one 'a' beyond the first character. `char` is 'a'.

When `s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)` is executed, it replaces the first occurrence of `char` ('a') in `s` with the character that is one position ahead of `char` in the ASCII table. Since `char` is 'a', `chr(ord(char) + 1)` will be 'b'. However, since the first 'a' in `s` is already replaced by 'b' according to the initial state, this replacement operation will actually replace the first 'a' that appears after the first character with 'b'.

The states of the other variables (`alphabet` and `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the input string with the first two 'a's replaced by 'b's and contains at least one 'a' beyond the second character, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is the input string with the first two 'a's replaced by 'b's and contains at least one 'a' beyond the second character, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.**
