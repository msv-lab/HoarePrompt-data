The function `func` accepts no parameters and returns no value. It prompts the user to input a string `s`. The function then iterates over each character in the alphabet, removing all occurrences of each character from the input string `s`, replacing them with the next character in the alphabet, and appends the removed characters to the result string `res`. After the loop executes, `res` will contain all characters from the input string `s` in the order of their appearance in the alphabet, and `s` will be empty if all characters were successfully replaced, or will contain characters that are not in the alphabet if there were any.

The function then checks if the length of `res` is 26. If it is, the function prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1. This implies that the function is checking if the input string `s` contains all 26 letters of the alphabet at least once. If it does, the function prints the letters in alphabetical order. If it does not, the function prints -1.

However, the function does not handle cases where the input string `s` contains uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. In such cases, the function will not replace these characters and will include them in the remaining string `s` after the loop executes.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string `s` is empty. In such cases, the function will print -1.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user to input a string, and checks if the input string contains all 26 letters of the alphabet at least once. If it does, the function prints the letters in alphabetical order. If it does not, the function prints -1. The function does not handle cases where the input string contains uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters, and will include them in the remaining string. The function also does not handle empty input strings and will print -1 in such cases. **
