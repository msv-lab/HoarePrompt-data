Based on the initial state, the code `print(res)` will print the string `res` which contains all characters from the input string `s` in the order of their appearance in the alphabet.

The values of the variables `s` and `char` do not change because of this print statement. 

Output State: **`res` is printed, `s` is empty or contains non-alphabet characters, `char` is the last character in the alphabet**
