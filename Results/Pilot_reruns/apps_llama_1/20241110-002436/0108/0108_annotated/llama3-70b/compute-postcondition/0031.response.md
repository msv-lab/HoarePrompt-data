According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has one less 'd' and one more 'e', and `char` is 'd'. Since `s` has one less 'd', it is possible that there are no 'd's left in `s`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `s` must still have at least one 'd'. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`res` remains the same, `s` has one less 'd' and one more 'e' and `s` still has at least one 'd', `char` is 'd'.**
