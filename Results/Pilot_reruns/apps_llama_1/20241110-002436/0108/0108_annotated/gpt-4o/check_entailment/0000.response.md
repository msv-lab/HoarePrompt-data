Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to make some number of moves to get the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" as a subsequence, but the code only checks if the input string contains all the characters of the alphabet in order. It does not attempt to make any moves to achieve this goal.

The annotations mention that the function does not handle edge cases such as empty input or non-alphabet characters. This is a valid concern, as the problem description does not specify what should happen in these cases. However, the code's failure to attempt to make moves to achieve the goal is a more significant issue.

For example, if the input string is "aaabbbccc", the code will print -1, but it is possible to make moves to get the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" as a subsequence by replacing some of the characters with the next character in alphabetical order.

The annotations also mention that the function prints the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' if the input string contains all characters of the target in order, or -1 otherwise. This is a correct description of the code's behavior, but it does not match the problem description's goal of making moves to achieve this goal.

Overall, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
