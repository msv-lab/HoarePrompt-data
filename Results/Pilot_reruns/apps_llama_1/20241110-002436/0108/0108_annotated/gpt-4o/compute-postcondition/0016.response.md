Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is equal to the minimum of `len(s)` and `target_len`, `j` is the number of characters in `s` that match the characters in `target` in order. If `len(s)` is less than `target_len`, the loop will terminate when `i` equals `len(s)`. If `target_len` is less than `len(s)`, the loop will terminate when `j` equals `target_len`. If `s` does not contain all characters of `target` in order, `j` will be less than `target_len`. If `s` is an empty string or `target` is an empty string, the loop will not execute and `i` and `j` will remain 0.**
