The value of `j` is incremented by 1, regardless of its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 2`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 2 from its original value, `j` is either incremented by 2 or increased by 1 from its original value depending on the match between `s` and `target`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 2`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 2 from its original value, `j` is either incremented by 2 or increased by 1 from its original value depending on the match between `s` and `target`.**
