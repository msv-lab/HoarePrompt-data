To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition: `while i < len(s) and j < target_len`.

1. `i < len(s)`: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `s`. Given that `s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 2`, we can infer that `s` has enough characters to allow `i` to increase without immediately exceeding the length of `s`. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the increment of `i` and the condition that `s` has a length greater than `i + 2`. Since `i` is increased by 3 from its original value, we need to ensure that after this increment, `i` is still less than `len(s)`. Therefore, the length of `s` must be greater than the new value of `i + 2`, which implies `s` must have a length greater than the original `i + 5`.

2. `j < target_len`: Given that `target_len` is 26, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 26. Since the problem doesn't specify how `j` changes except in relation to the match at index `i - 2` of `s` and index `j` of `target`, and we don't have the exact values of `j` after the last iteration, we cannot directly adjust `j`. However, we can infer that since `j` is incremented by 1 when a match is found, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be less than 26 after the last iteration.

Considering these points, the states that need adjustment are:

- `s` is an input string with length greater than the original `i + 5`, to ensure `i < len(s)` after `i` is increased by 3.
- `j` must be less than 26, but since we don't have the exact value of `j` after the last iteration, we cannot specify a particular value for `j`. However, we know that for the loop to continue, `j` must not have reached 26.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`s` is an input string with length greater than the original `i + 5`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 3 from its original value, `j` is less than 26**
