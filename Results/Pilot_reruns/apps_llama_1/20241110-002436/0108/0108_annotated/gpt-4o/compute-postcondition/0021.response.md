The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it implicitly accepts a string input from the user. 

Based on the code, the function checks if the input string contains all the characters of the alphabet in order. If it does, the function prints the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If it does not, the function prints -1.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic. For example, the function does not handle the case where the input string is empty or contains non-alphabet characters. In such cases, the function will still print -1.

Additionally, the function does not return any value, it only prints the result. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user, checks if the input string contains all the characters of the alphabet in order, and prints the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' if it does, or -1 otherwise, without handling edge cases such as empty input or non-alphabet characters. **
