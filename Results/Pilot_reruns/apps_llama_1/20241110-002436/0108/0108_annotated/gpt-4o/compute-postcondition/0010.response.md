Based on the initial state and the given Python code snippet, the output state can be calculated as follows:

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1.

Since `i` was previously increased by 1, the new value of `i` will be 2 more than its original value.

The other variables `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 1`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 2 from its original value, `j` is either incremented by 1 or retains its original value depending on the match between `s` and `target`.
