Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that it only checks if the characters in the input string `s` match the characters in the target string in the order they appear, without considering the possibility of replacing characters in `s` to get the target string as a subsequence.

For example, if the input string is "abbc", the program will output "-1" because it does not find the character "c" immediately after "b". However, according to the problem description, it is possible to replace the second "b" with "c" to get the target string "abc" as a subsequence.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
