The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is less than 25, so the new value of `j` is less than or equal to 25. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1 again, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` is less than or equal to 25.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1 again, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` is less than or equal to 25**
