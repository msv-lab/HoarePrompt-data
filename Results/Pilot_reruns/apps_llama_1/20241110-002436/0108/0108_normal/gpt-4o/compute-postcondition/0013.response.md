Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1 again, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` is less than 25. If the character at index `i` in `s` matches the character at index `j` in `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.***
