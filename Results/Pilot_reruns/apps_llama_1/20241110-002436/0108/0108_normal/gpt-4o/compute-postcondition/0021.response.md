Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func` accepts no parameters and returns no value. It prompts the user to input a string `s`. The function then checks if the input string `s` contains all the characters of the alphabet in order. If it does, the function prints the alphabet string `target`. Otherwise, it prints -1.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the function does not handle the case where the input string `s` is empty or contains non-alphabet characters. In such cases, the function will still print -1, but it would be more accurate to say that the function prints -1 for any input string that does not contain all the characters of the alphabet in order.

Additionally, the annotations mention that the function returns a value, but the code does not contain a return statement. Therefore, I will not include any mention of a return value in the functionality summary.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user to input a string, and prints the alphabet string if the input string contains all the characters of the alphabet in order; otherwise, it prints -1 for any input string that does not meet this condition, including empty strings and strings containing non-alphabet characters. **
