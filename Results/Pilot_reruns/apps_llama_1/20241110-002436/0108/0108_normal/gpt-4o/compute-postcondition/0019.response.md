Postcondition: ***`i` is the minimum of `len(s)` and the position where `j` reaches `target_len`, `j` is the number of characters in `target` found in `s` in order, capped at `target_len`. If `j` equals `target_len`, `target` is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed. This covers all cases, including when `s` is empty or `target_len` is 0, in which case `i` and `j` remain 0 and -1 is printed.***
