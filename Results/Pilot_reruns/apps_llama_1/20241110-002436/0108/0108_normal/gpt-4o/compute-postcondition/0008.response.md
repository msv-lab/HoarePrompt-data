The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is less than 26, so the output state is: `s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` is less than or equal to 26.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` is less than or equal to 26**
