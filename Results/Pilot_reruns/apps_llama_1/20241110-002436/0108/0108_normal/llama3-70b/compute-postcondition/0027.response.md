To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `if 'b' is in s then res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus the number of times the loop executes plus one 'c'.
- `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's and all 'b's replaced by 'c's.
- `char` is 'c'.

The code is: `s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)`

This line of code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that is one position ahead of `char` in the ASCII table. Since `char` is 'c', `chr(ord(char) + 1)` will be 'd'.

So, after executing this line of code, the first 'c' in `s` will be replaced by 'd'.

The output state is:
- `if 'b' is in s then res` is still a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in the updated `s` plus the number of times the loop executes plus one 'c'.
- `s` is the updated input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, all 'b's replaced by 'c's, and the first 'c' replaced by 'd'.
- `char` is still 'c'.

Output State: **`if 'b' is in s then res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in the updated `s` plus the number of times the loop executes plus one 'c', `s` is the updated input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, all 'b's replaced by 'c's, and the first 'c' replaced by 'd', `char` is 'c'.**
