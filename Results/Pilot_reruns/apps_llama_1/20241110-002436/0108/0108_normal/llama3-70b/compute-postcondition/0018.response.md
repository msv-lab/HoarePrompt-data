To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus 1.
- `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, the first 'b' replaced by 'c', and at least one 'b' still present.
- `char` is 'b'.

The code to execute is:
```python
res += char
```

Given that `char` is 'b', this code appends 'b' to the end of the string `res`.

Since `res` initially has a number of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus 1, adding one more 'b' to `res` will increase the count of 'b's in `res` by 1.

The states of `s` and `char` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus 2.
- `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, the first 'b' replaced by 'c', and at least one 'b' still present.
- `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus 2, `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, the first 'b' replaced by 'c', and at least one 'b' still present, `char` is 'b'.**
