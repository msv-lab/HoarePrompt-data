Postcondition: ***The input string `s` has all its characters replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and `res` is a string containing all characters from `s` in the order they appear in the alphabet. If `res` contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, `res` is printed to the console; otherwise, the value -1 is printed, indicating that `res` does not contain all characters of the alphabet. If `s` is an empty string, `res` remains an empty string, and -1 is printed. If `s` contains characters not in the alphabet, these characters remain unchanged in `s`, and the corresponding characters in `res` are determined by the characters in `s` that are in the alphabet.***
