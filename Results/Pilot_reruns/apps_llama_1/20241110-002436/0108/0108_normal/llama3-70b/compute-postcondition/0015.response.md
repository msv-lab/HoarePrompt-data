The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of `res`. Since `char` is 'b', `res` will have an additional 'b' at the end.

Initial State: `if 'b' is in s then res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in s, s is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, char is 'b'

Output State: **`res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in s plus 1, s is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, char is 'b'**
