Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will provide a concise summary of the function's functionality.

The function `func` accepts no parameters. It takes an input string `s` from the user and replaces each character in the string with the next character in the alphabet. The replaced characters are added to a result string `res` in the order they appear in the alphabet. If the input string contains characters not in the alphabet, these characters remain unchanged.

After processing the input string, the function checks if the result string `res` contains all 26 characters of the alphabet. If it does, the function prints the result string `res` to the console. Otherwise, it prints the value -1, indicating that the result string does not contain all characters of the alphabet.

The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains non-alphabet characters. In these cases, the function will still process the input string, but the result string `res` may not contain all 26 characters of the alphabet, and the function will print -1.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, takes an input string from the user, replaces each character with the next character in the alphabet, and adds the replaced characters to a result string in alphabetical order. If the result string contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it prints the result string; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle empty input strings or non-alphabet characters, and in these cases, it will print -1. **
