The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of `res`. The value of `char` is 'c', and `res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus the number of times the loop executes.

After execution, `res` is appended with 'c'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `if 'b' is in s then res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus the number of times the loop executes plus one 'c', `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's and all 'b's replaced by 'c's, `char` is 'c'.

Output State: **`if 'b' is in s then res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus the number of times the loop executes plus one 'c', `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's and all 'b's replaced by 'c's, `char` is 'c'.**
