Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. The logic is as follows:

- It first finds the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is the minimum of the number of lemons available (`a`), the number of apples available divided by 2 (`b // 2`), and the number of pears available divided by 4 (`c // 4`). This ensures that the ratio of lemons to apples to pears is 1:2:4.

- Then, it calculates the total number of fruits that can be used by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 1 (for lemons), 2 (for apples), and 4 (for pears), and summing these values.

This approach correctly handles all possible cases, including when Nikolay does not have enough fruits to cook any compote (in which case `max_lemons` will be 0). The program also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases, and the correctness is **True**.
