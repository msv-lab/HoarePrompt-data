To calculate the output state, we need to determine the value of `max_lemons` based on the given initial state.

`max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we can't determine their exact values. However, we can express the output state in terms of the input values.

The value of `max_lemons` will be the smallest among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This means `max_lemons` will be less than or equal to `a`, less than or equal to half of `b`, and less than or equal to a quarter of `c`.

The output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
