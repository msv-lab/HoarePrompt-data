The function accepts no parameters, uses three input integers a, b, and c, calculates the minimum among a, b // 2, and c // 4, calculates the total fruits as 7 times this minimum value, and prints this total fruits value, assuming that the inputs are integers. If the inputs are not integers, the function will raise a ValueError. If the inputs are not positive integers, the result might not be meaningful.
