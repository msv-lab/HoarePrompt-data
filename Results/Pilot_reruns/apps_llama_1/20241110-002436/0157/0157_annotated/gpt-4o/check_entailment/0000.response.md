Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote in the ratio 1:2:4.

The annotations helped me understand the code better, especially the calculation of `max_lemons` and `total_fruits`. The annotation for `max_lemons` states that it is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which makes sense because we need to find the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available number of apples and pears.

The annotation for `total_fruits` states that it is 7 times the value of `max_lemons`, which is correct because for each lemon, we need 2 apples and 4 pears, so the total number of fruits is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 times the number of lemons.

I checked the examples provided in the problem description, and the code produces the correct output for all of them. I also tried to think of other potential cases, but I couldn't find any where the code would not work as expected.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
