Correctness: **True**

I analyzed the code and the problem description, and I believe that the code correctly implements the problem description. The code takes three integer inputs from the user, calculates the minimum value among the first input, half of the second input, and a quarter of the third input, and prints the result multiplied by 7. This matches the problem description, which states that the fruits should be in the ratio 1:2:4 and that the maximum total number of fruits should be printed.

The code annotations were helpful in understanding the code, but I did not find any cases that suggested the code was incorrect. The annotations mention that the function does not handle non-integer inputs or negative integers, but this is not a requirement of the problem description, which states that the inputs are positive integers.

I also checked the examples provided in the problem description, and the code produces the correct output for all of them. For example, when the inputs are 2, 5, and 7, the code correctly prints 7, which is the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote.

Overall, I believe that the code correctly implements the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
