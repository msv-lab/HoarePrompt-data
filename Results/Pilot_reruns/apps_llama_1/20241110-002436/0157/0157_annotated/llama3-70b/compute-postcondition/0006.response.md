Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it takes three integer inputs from the user and stores them in variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The code then calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` and stores it in the variable `min_lemon`.

Finally, the function prints the value of `min_lemon * 7`.

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The code does not handle cases where the user inputs non-integer values. In such cases, the `int(input())` statement will raise a `ValueError`.
* The code does not handle cases where the user inputs negative integers. Although the annotations state that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, the code does not enforce this constraint.
* The code does not return any value, but instead prints the result directly. This is different from the usual behavior of a function, which typically returns a value.

Taking these edge cases and missing logic into account, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function takes three integer inputs from the user, calculates the minimum value among the first input, half of the second input, and a quarter of the third input, and prints the result multiplied by 7. The function does not handle non-integer inputs or negative integers, and does not return any value. **
