To calculate the output state, we need to understand the given code and initial state. The initial state provides us with the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `min_lemon`. The code snippet is a print statement that calculates a value based on `min_lemon`.

The print statement calculates `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This can be simplified to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which is `min_lemon * 7`.

Since `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, we don't know the exact value of `min_lemon`. However, we know that it is the minimum of these three values.

The print statement does not change the state of the variables, so the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `min_lemon` remain the same.

The output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the function prints `min_lemon * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the function prints `min_lemon * 7`.**
