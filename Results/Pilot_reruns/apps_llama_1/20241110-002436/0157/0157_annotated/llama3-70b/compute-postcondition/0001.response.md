The value of `b` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which is an input integer. The previous state of `b` being a positive integer is overridden. The states of `a` and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
