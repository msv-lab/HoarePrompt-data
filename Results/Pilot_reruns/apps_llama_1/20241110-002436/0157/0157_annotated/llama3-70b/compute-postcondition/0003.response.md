`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, the values of `b // 2` and `c // 4` are integers as well, obtained by performing integer division. The output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**
