The code assigns a new value to `a` using the `int(input())` function, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, but the specific values are not known.

Since `a` is reassigned a new value, its previous value as a positive integer is lost. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
