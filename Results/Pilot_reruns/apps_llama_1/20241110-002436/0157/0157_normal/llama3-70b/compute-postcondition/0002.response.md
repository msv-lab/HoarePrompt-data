To solve this problem, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer.

The given code is:
```
c = int(input())
```
This line of code assigns a new value to `c`. The `input()` function accepts an input from the user, and `int()` converts this input into an integer. 

However, the initial state already states that `c` is a positive integer. The code does not change the values of `a` and `b`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
