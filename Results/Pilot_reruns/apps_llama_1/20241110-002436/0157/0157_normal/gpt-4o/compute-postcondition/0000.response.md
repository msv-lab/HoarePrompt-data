The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to `a`. The initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, but the value of `a` is overwritten by the input. The values of `b` and `c` are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
