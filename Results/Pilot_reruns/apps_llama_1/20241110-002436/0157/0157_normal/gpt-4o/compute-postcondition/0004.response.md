To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Given Code:
```python
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

Now, let's calculate the result step by step:

1. `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. However, the exact value of `max_lemons` is unknown since it depends on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. The code calculates `total_fruits` by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1, 2, and 4, and then adding the results.

3. We can simplify the calculation as follows:
   - `max_lemons * 1` equals `max_lemons`
   - `max_lemons * 2` equals `2 * max_lemons`
   - `max_lemons * 4` equals `4 * max_lemons`
   - Adding these results gives us `max_lemons + 2 * max_lemons + 4 * max_lemons`, which simplifies to `7 * max_lemons`.

4. Therefore, `total_fruits` is equal to `7 * max_lemons`.

5. The states of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is 7 times `max_lemons`**
