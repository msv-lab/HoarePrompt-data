Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `func` does not accept any parameters.
2. The function takes three integer inputs from the user: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The function calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` and assigns it to `max_lemons`.
4. The function calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying `max_lemons` by 7 (1 + 2 + 4) and assigns it to `total_fruits`.
5. The function prints the value of `total_fruits`.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If the user inputs non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
* If the user inputs negative integers, the function will still calculate the minimum value and total fruits, but the result may not make sense in the context of the problem.
* If the user inputs zero for any of the inputs, the function will still calculate the minimum value and total fruits, but the result may not make sense in the context of the problem.

Based on the code and considering the potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function takes three integer inputs from the user, calculates the minimum value among the inputs and their divisions by 2 and 4, calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the minimum value by 7, and prints the result. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, negative integers, or zero inputs, and the result may not make sense in these cases. **
