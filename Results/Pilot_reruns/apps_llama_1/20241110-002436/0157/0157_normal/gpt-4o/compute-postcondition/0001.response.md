The code `b = int(input())` assigns a new value to `b`, which is the integer conversion of the user's input. The previous state of `b` being a positive integer is overridden by this new value. The state of `a` and `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
