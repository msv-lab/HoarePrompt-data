Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. The key insight is to find the minimum number of lemons that can be used, given the constraints of the ratio 1:2:4. This is done by finding the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which represents the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available number of apples or pears.

Once the minimum number of lemons is found, the program calculates the total number of fruits that can be used by multiplying the minimum number of lemons by the corresponding ratio factors (1, 2, and 4).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program correctly handles the cases where Nikolay has enough fruits to cook the compote, as well as the cases where he doesn't have enough fruits. The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
