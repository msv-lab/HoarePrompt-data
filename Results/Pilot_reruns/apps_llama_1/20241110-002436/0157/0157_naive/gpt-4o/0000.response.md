Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It first finds the minimum number of lemons that can be used, considering the constraints that for each lemon, there must be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. This is done by finding the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 1 (for lemons), 2 (for apples), and 4 (for pears), and summing them up.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where Nikolay does not have enough fruits to cook any compote (in which case the output is 0). The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program.
