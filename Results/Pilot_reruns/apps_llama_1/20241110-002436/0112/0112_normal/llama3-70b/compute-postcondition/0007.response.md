To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as there are more sublists in `cubes`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `cubes` is a list of at least 2 sublists, and `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`. For the loop to execute again, `cubes` must have at least 3 sublists, and `cube` should be the third sublist in `cubes`. The state of `n` and `digits` does not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cubes` is a list of at least 3 sublists, `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique digit in both the original and new `cube` sublists**
