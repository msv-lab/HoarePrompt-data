Let's analyze the given code.

The code `digits = set()` creates a new empty set and assigns it to the variable `digits`.

Since `n` and `cubes` are not affected by this code, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing a list of integers read from the user's input, `digits` is an empty set**
