Let's break down the code:

`cubes = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]`

This line of code is using a list comprehension to create a new list `cubes`. The list comprehension iterates `n` times, where `n` is an input integer.

In each iteration, it reads a line of input using `input()`, splits the input into a list of strings using `split()`, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int,...)`. The resulting list of integers is then added to the `cubes` list.

Since `n` is an input integer, the number of iterations is determined by the user's input. Let's assume the user inputs a value for `n`, say `k`.

The initial state of `cubes` is a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) for each of the previous value of `n` cubes. However, this initial state is overwritten by the new list comprehension.

After executing the code, the `cubes` list will contain `k` sublists, each containing a list of integers read from the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing a list of integers read from the user's input**
