Based on the provided loop code and the initial state, I will analyze the output state of the loop.

The loop iterates over each sublist in the `cubes` list and updates the `digits` set with the string representation of each unique digit in the current sublist.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see that:

* `n` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop will execute at least once if `cubes` is not empty.
* `cubes` is a list of at least 1 sublist, and `cube` is the current sublist being processed.
* `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique digit in the current and previous sublists.

Considering the loop's functionality, we can infer that:

* If `cubes` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `digits` will remain an empty set.
* If `cubes` contains at least one sublist, the loop will execute, and `digits` will contain the string representation of each unique digit in all sublists.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **If `cubes` is not empty, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique digit in all sublists of `cubes`. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set.**
