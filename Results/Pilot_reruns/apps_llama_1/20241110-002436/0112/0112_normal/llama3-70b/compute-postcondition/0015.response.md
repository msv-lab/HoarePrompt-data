Based on the provided parameter constraints, the function `func` seems to be missing parameters. However, I'll proceed with the information given.


The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 (inclusive), and `cubes` is a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) for each of the `n` cubes.


However, since the output section is empty, I'll assume the task is to describe the input parameters and acknowledge the missing output information.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `cubes`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `cubes` is a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9 for each of the `n` cubes. The function's output is not specified.**
