The code updates the `digits` set by adding the string representation of each unique digit in the `cube` sublist. 

Since `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`, the unique digits in `cube` are added to the `digits` set.

The output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `cubes` is a list of at least 3 sublists, `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique digit in both the original and new `cube` sublists, including the new digits from `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cubes` is a list of at least 3 sublists, `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique digit in both the original and new `cube` sublists, including the new digits from `cube`.**
