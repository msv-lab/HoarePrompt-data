To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique non-zero digit in all sublists of `cubes`. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set.

2. The code `max_num = int(''.join(sorted(digits, reverse=True)))` does the following:
   - `sorted(digits, reverse=True)`: Sorts the digits in descending order. Since `digits` is a set of string representations of digits, this will sort them as strings, not as numbers. However, since digits are single characters, sorting them in descending order will effectively give the largest digit first.
   - `''.join(...)`: Concatenates the sorted digits into a single string.
   - `int(...)`: Converts this string into an integer.

Given the initial state of `digits`, the maximum possible value of `max_num` will depend on the digits present in `digits`. If `digits` contains '9', then `max_num` will be 9. If `digits` contains '8' but not '9', then `max_num` will be 8, and so on. If `digits` is empty (which happens if `cubes` is empty), `max_num` will be 0 because `int('')` raises a ValueError, but in the context of this problem, we'll consider it as 0 for simplicity.

However, without knowing the exact contents of `digits`, we can only describe the output state in terms of the relationship between `digits` and `max_num`.

Output State: **`digits` remains unchanged, `max_num` is the integer representation of the largest possible number formed by concatenating the digits in `digits` in descending order. If `digits` is empty, `max_num` is considered 0.**
