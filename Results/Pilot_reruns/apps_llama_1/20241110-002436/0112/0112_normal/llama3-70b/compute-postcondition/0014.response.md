The code prints the value of `max_num`, which is the integer representation of the largest possible number formed by concatenating the digits in `digits` in descending order. The state of the variables does not change, but the value of `max_num` is printed.

Output State: **`digits` remains unchanged, `max_num` is printed and is the integer representation of the largest possible number formed by concatenating the digits in `digits` in descending order. If `digits` is empty, `max_num` is considered 0.**
