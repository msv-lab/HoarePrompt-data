To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the state of the variables involved in the loop. The loop iterates over the `cubes` list, so we need to adjust the state to guarantee that the loop will execute at least once.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `cubes` is not an empty list. Since `cubes` is a list of `n` sublists, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

At the start of the loop, the loop variable `cube` should be the first element of the `cubes` list.

The state of `digits` being an empty set does not affect the execution of the loop, so we don't need to adjust it.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cubes` is a list of at least 1 sublist, `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
