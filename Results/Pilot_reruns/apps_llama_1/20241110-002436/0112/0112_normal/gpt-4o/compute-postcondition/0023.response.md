To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop iterates over the `digits` list. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the `digits` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
* The function either returns False or does not return anything
* `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, and `k` remain unchanged
* `found` is either `True` or `False`

Since `digits` remains unchanged, we can conclude that the loop will execute again if and only if there is at least one more element in the `digits` list.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
* `digits` must have at least one more element

The other states remain unchanged.

State: **The function either returns False or does not return anything, `n`, `cube_faces`, and `k` remain unchanged, `found` is either `True` or `False`, and `digits` has at least one more element**
