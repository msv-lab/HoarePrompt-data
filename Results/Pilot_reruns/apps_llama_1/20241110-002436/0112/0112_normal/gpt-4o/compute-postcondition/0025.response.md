According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least one more element. For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `digits` does not need to be adjusted, but the state of `digit` needs to be adjusted to be the next element in the list.

State: **The function either returns False or does not return anything, `n`, `cube_faces`, and `k` remain unchanged, `found` is False, and `digits` has at least one more element, `digit` is the next element in the list**
