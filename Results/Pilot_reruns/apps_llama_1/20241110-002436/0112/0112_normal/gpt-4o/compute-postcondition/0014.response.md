To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 1, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 2, and `n` to be at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted, as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of at least 1 character representing the digits of `num`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2**
