Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of at least 1 character representing the digits of `num`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2. If `used_cubes[i]` is initially `False` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
