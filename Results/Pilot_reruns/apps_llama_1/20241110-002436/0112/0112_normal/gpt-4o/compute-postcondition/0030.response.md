The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. `n` is a positive integer, and `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, representing the 6 faces of each cube, such that 0 <= cube_faces[i][j] <= 9 for all i and j.

After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to form a number using the given cubes. 

There are two possible return cases:
Case_1: If it is not possible to form the number, the function returns `False`.
Case_2: If it is possible to form the number, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and return `True` if it is possible to form the number using the given cubes, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and returns `True` if it is possible to form the number using the given cubes, and `False` otherwise.**
