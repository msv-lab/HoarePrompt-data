To solve this task, we need to know the value of `num` to calculate the value of `digits`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `num`, we can only express the output state in terms of `num`. 

The `str(num)` function converts the integer `num` to a string, and `list(str(num))` converts this string to a list of characters. Since `num` is not specified, let's assume it is a positive integer with `k` digits.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of `k` characters representing the digits of `num`.**
