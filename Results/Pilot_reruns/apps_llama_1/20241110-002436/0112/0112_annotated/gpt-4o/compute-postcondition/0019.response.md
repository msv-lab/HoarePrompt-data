According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.

Other states do not need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `i` and `n`. The states of `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, and `found` do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 3; `used_cubes` is either `[True, True, False]` or `[True, False, True]`; `found` is True**
