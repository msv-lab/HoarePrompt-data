Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, `i` is 0. If the first cube is not used and the first digit is in the first cube's faces, then `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where the first element is True and the rest are False, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
