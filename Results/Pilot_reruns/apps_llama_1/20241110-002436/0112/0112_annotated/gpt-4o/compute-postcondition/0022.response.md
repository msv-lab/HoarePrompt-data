Postcondition: ***The function returns False if `found` is False, regardless of the state of `used_cubes`. If `found` is True, the function does not return, and the state of `used_cubes` and `found` remains unchanged, with `used_cubes` having at least one True value if a match was found, and all False values otherwise. The state of the variables also remains unchanged if `n` is 0 or negative, although the case where `n` is negative is not explicitly handled by the code.***
