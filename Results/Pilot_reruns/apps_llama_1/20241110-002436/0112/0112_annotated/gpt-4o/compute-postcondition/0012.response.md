Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 1; `used_cubes` is `[True, True]` if `n` is 2, or `[True, True, False]` if `n` is 3; `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
