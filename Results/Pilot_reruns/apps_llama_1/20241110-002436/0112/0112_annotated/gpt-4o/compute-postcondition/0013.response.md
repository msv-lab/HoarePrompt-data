Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 1; if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` is False, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` remains True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no changes are made to `used_cubes` and `found`. The state of `used_cubes` is either `[True, True]` if `n` is 2, or `[True, True, False]` or `[True, False, True]` if `n` is 3, and `found` remains True.***
