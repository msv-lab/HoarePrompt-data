According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is already an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, the loop variable `i` is not defined in the initial state.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to include the initial value of `i`, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to False, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
