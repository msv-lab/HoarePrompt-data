To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to False.
2. `i` is 0.
3. The code `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the value at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list to True.

Given that `i` is 0, this means the first element in the `used_cubes` list will be set to True.

The initial state of the other variables does not change as a result of this code. Therefore, the output state is:

`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, 
`cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, 
`digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, 
`used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where the first element is True and the rest are False, 
`digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, 
`found` is False, 
`i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where the first element is True and the rest are False, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
