To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. The initial state provides the following information:
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 3.
   - `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers.
   - `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where the first element is True and the rest are False.
   - `found` is True.

2. The given code is:
   ```
used_cubes[i] = True
```
   This line of code sets the value of the element at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list to True.

3. Given that `i` is 1, this means the second element in `used_cubes` will be set to True. Since `n` can be 2 or 3 (given 1 < n <= 3), `used_cubes` initially looks like this: `[True, False]` if `n` is 2, or `[True, False, False]` if `n` is 3.

4. After executing the code, `used_cubes` will be modified as follows:
   - If `n` is 2, `used_cubes` becomes `[True, True]`.
   - If `n` is 3, `used_cubes` becomes `[True, True, False]`.

5. The states of the other variables (`n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, and `found`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 3.
- `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers.
- `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `n` is 2, `used_cubes` is `[True, True]`; if `n` is 3, `used_cubes` is `[True, True, False]`.
- `found` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 1; `used_cubes` is `[True, True]` if `n` is 2, or `[True, True, False]` if `n` is 3; `found` is True**
