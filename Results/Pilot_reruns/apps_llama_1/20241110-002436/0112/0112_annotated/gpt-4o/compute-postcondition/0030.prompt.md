You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, and cube_faces is a list of 6-element lists of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 9, inclusive.
```
def can_form_number(num):
```
Output: Case_1: The function returns False if any digit in `digits` cannot be found on any of the available cube faces in `cube_faces`. If the function does not return False, `used_cubes` will have at least one True value for each digit in `digits` that was found on a cube face, and the remaining values will be False. The loop will not execute if `digits` is empty, and in this case, `used_cubes` will remain unchanged with all False values. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged, although the case where `n` is negative is not explicitly handled by the code.

Case_2: The function returns True, and the state of the variables remains unchanged: `used_cubes` has at least one True value for each digit in `digits` that was found on a cube face, and the remaining values are False, or all values are False if `digits` is empty or `n` is 0 or negative.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
