To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `n` should be greater than 1 to satisfy the loop condition.

The other variables (`cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, and `found`) are not affected by the loop condition, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, `i` is 1, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where the first element is True and the rest are False, `found` is True**
