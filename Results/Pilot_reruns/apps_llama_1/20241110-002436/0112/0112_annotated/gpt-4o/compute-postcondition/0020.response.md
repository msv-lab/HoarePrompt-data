Output State: **The loop checks if the digit is present in any of the cube faces that have not been used yet. If it finds a match, it marks the corresponding cube as used and sets the found flag to True, then exits the loop. After the loop executes, `used_cubes` will have at least one True value if a match is found, and `found` will be True. If no match is found, `used_cubes` will remain all False and `found` will remain False. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged. The loop will also not execute if `n` is negative, but this case is not explicitly handled by the code.**
