Based on the given initial state and Python code snippet, here is the output state:


The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. However, the initial state already states that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, so the value of `n` remains the same. 


Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
