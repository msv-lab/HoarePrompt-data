According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. If `cubes` has at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 sublist, `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `cubes` must have at least 2 sublists and `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`. Also, `digits` should be updated to contain the string representations of the digits in the second sublist of `cubes`.

State: **`cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers with `n` is either 2 or 3 and has at least 2 sublists, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the second sublist of `cubes`, `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`.**
