The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it is expected to receive input for multiple cubes, where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers, and there are n such cubes, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. 

However, since the function definition is `def func():`, it does not explicitly accept any parameters. Therefore, it is assumed that the input for the cubes is provided internally or through some other means not specified in the function definition.

If we were to rewrite the function to explicitly accept the input for the cubes, the corrected function definition might look like this: `def func(*cubes):`, where `*cubes` represents a variable number of cube inputs.

Assuming the original function definition is correct, and the input for the cubes is provided internally, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but it is expected to receive input for multiple cubes internally, where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers, and there are n such cubes, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 3.**
