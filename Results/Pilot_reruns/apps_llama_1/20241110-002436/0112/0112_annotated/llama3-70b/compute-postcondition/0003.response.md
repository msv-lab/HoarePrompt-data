Let's break it down step by step:


According to the code, the loop will execute for each `cube` in the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must have at least one element.


At the start of the loop, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, where `n` is either 1, 2, or 3. This means `cubes` can have 1, 2, or 3 sublists.


Since `digits` is an empty set, it does not affect the execution of the loop.


To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `cubes` has at least one sublist, and we are currently processing the first sublist.


State: **`cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers with `n` is either 1, 2, or 3 and has at least 1 sublist, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`**
