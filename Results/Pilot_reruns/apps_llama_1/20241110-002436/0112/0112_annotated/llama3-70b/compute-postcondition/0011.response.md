To calculate the output state, let's analyze the code and the initial state.

The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits` if it exists.

Given the initial state:

- If `cubes` is not empty, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of all digits in all sublists of `cubes`, and `cube` is the last sublist processed.
- If `cubes` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `digits` remains an empty set.

After executing the code `digits.remove('0')`, the following changes occur:

- If '0' is in `digits`, it is removed. This means `digits` no longer contains '0'.
- If '0' is not in `digits`, the state of `digits` does not change.
- The state of `cubes` and `cube` is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

- If `cubes` is not empty, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of all digits in all sublists of `cubes`, excluding '0', and `cube` is the last sublist processed.
- If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set.

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing unique string representations of all digits in all sublists of `cubes`, excluding '0', if `cubes` is not empty; otherwise, `digits` is an empty set.**
