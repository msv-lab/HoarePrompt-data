The code accepts input for `n` number of lists, where each list contains integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers using the `map` function. The lists are then stored in the `cubes` variable.

The initial state of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. This means that the code will accept input for either 1, 2, or 3 lists of integers.

The output state will be the value of `cubes`, which will be a list of lists of integers, where the number of inner lists is equal to the value of `n`.

Output State: **`cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, where `n` is either 1, 2, or 3**
