The `digits` set is updated with the string representations of the digits in the `cube` list. The `cube` list is the third sublist in the `cubes` list.

Since `digits` already contains the string representations of the digits in the second sublist of `cubes`, the update operation will add the string representations of the digits in the `cube` list to the `digits` set.

The `cubes` list and its sublists, including the `cube` list, are not modified by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the second and third sublists of `cubes`, `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`.

Output State: **`cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the second and third sublists of `cubes`, `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`.**
