To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, where `n` is either 1, 2, or 3 and has at least 1 sublist.
- `digits` is an empty set.
- `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`.

The code snippet is:
```python
digits.update(str(digit) for digit in cube)
```
This line of code updates the `digits` set with the string representations of each digit in the `cube` list.

Since `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes` and `cubes` has at least one sublist, `cube` is a list of integers. The `update` method of the `digits` set will add the string representation of each integer in `cube` to the set.

After execution, the state of `cubes` and `cube` remains unchanged because the code does not modify these variables. However, the `digits` set is updated with the string representations of the digits in `cube`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers with `n` is either 1, 2, or 3 and has at least 1 sublist.
- `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first sublist of `cubes`.
- `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`.

Output State: **`cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers with `n` is either 1, 2, or 3 and has at least 1 sublist, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first sublist of `cubes`, `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`.**
