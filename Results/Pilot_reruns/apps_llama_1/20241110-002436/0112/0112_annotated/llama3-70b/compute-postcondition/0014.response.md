The code prints the value of `max_num`, which is the maximum possible integer formed using the unique digits in `cubes`. The value of `max_num` is printed, but it does not change the state of the variables. The state of `digits` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`digits` remains unchanged, `max_num` is printed, and its value is the maximum possible integer formed using the unique digits in `cubes`**
