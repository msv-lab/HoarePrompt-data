Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not consider the availability of each digit on the cubes. It simply removes the '0' from the set of digits and then joins the remaining digits in descending order to form the maximum number. However, this approach does not guarantee that the maximum number can be formed using the available cubes.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7
```
The program will output 987, but it is not possible to form the number 987 using the available cubes because there is no cube with the digit 9 on the top face and the digit 8 on the top face at the same time.

A correct solution would need to consider the availability of each digit on the cubes and find the maximum number that can be formed using the available digits.
