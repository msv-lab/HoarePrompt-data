Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input number contains leading zeros. According to the problem description, the number can't contain leading zeros. However, the program does not check for this condition.

For example, if the input is:

3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

The program will return 87, but it should return a smaller number because it's not possible to form numbers with leading zeros, such as 08, 09, etc.

Additionally, the program does not consider the rotation of the cubes. The problem description states that Masha can rotate her cubes to form numbers, but the program does not take this into account. It only checks if the digits are present on the cubes, but it does not consider the rotation of the cubes to form different digits.

For example, if the input is:

3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

The program will return 87, but it should return a smaller number because it's not possible to form the digit 9 by rotating the cubes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
