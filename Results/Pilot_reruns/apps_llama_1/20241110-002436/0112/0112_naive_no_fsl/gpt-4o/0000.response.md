Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where a number starts with 0. According to the problem description, the number can't contain leading zeros. However, the program does not check for this condition.

For example, if the input is:

2
0 1 2 3 4 5
0 6 7 8 9 1

The program will return 9, but it should return 0 because Masha can't make any number that starts with 0.

The program should be modified to check if the first digit of the number is 0, and if so, return False in the can_form_number function. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(n, cubes):
    from itertools import product
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]

    def can_form_number(num):
        digits = list(str(num))
        if digits[0] == '0':  # Check if the number starts with 0
            return False
        used_cubes = [False] * n
        for digit in digits:
            found = False
            for i in range(n):
                if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                    used_cubes[i] = True
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                return False
        return True
    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
    return x
```
