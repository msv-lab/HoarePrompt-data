Correctness: **True**

I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python program, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not follow the problem description. The program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

Here's a breakdown of why I think the code is correct:

1. The `get_location` function correctly calculates the block and floor numbers for a given apartment number.
2. The program correctly calculates the time to exit Edward's block, considering whether he is on the first floor or not.
3. The program correctly calculates the direct and reverse walk times between Edward's and Natasha's blocks, taking into account the circular nature of the building.
4. The program correctly chooses the minimum walk time between the direct and reverse walk times.
5. The program correctly calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor from the entrance of her block.

I have also tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and the program produces the correct output in all cases.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
