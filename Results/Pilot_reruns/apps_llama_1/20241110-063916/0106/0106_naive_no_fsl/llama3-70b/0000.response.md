Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum time it takes to move between floors when using the stairs. 

In the line `min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`, the program adds 10 seconds to the total time, which is the time it takes for the elevator to arrive. However, this is incorrect because the problem states that the elevator is only used when moving between floors in the same block, not when moving between blocks. 

When moving between blocks, the program should only consider the time it takes to move between floors using the stairs, which is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5` or `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5`, depending on whether Edward needs to move up or down.

A correct implementation would be to separate the calculation of the minimum time it takes to move between blocks and the minimum time it takes to move between floors in the same block. 

For example, when moving between blocks, the program could calculate the minimum time it takes to move between floors using the stairs, and then add the time it takes to move between blocks. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
min_floor_time = abs(b_floor - a_floor) * 5
if a_block == b_block:
    min_time = min(min_floor_time, (abs(b_floor - a_floor) + 1) + 10)
else:
    min_time = min_block_time + min_floor_time
print(min_time)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the minimum time it takes to move between blocks and floors, and handles the case where Edward needs to move between floors in the same block.
