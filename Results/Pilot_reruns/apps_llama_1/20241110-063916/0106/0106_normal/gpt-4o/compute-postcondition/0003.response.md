The function returns `block` and `floor`. The values of `block` and `floor` are not changed by the return statement, so their values remain the same. The return statement does not affect the state of the other variables, so their values also remain the same.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers, `block` is an integer such that 1 ≤ block ≤ n, `floor_within_block` is an integer between 0 and `m * k - 1`, inclusive, `floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, inclusive, and the function returns `block` and `floor`.**
