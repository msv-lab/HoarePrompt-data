Let's break down the code step by step.

The code calculates the `reverse_walk_time` as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. 

Since `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` are positive integers, `abs(block_a - block_b)` will be a non-negative integer. Subtracting this value from `n` and taking the modulus `n` will give a value between 0 and `n-1`. Multiplying this value by 15 will give the `reverse_walk_time`.

The values of `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, and `time_to_exit` are not affected by this code.

The value of `direct_walk_time` is also not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n*m*k`, `a`!= `b`, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values related to the location of `a` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values related to the location of `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, and `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n*m*k`, `a`!= `b`, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values related to the location of `a` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values related to the location of `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, and `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
