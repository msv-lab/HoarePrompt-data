The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a 3D space, and `a` and `b` are distinct positive integers within the range 1 to `n*m*k`, representing locations in the 3D space.

The function calculates the total time required to move from location `a` to location `b` in the 3D space. The total time is calculated as the sum of three components: `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

`time_to_exit` is either 0 if the starting location `a` is on the first floor, or 10 plus the difference between the floor number of `a` and 1.

`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, which are calculated based on the absolute difference between the block numbers of `a` and `b`, modulo `n`, multiplied by 15.

`time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 to 5*(k-1), representing the time required to move to the target floor.

The function returns the total time required to move from location `a` to location `b`.

Functionality: ** The function calculates the total time required to move from location `a` to location `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, considering the time to exit the starting floor, the minimum walking time, and the time to reach the target floor, and returns the total time. **
