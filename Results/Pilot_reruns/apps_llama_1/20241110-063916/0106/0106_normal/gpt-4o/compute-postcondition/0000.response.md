The code calculates the value of `block` based on the value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. However, the initial state does not mention the value of `apartment`. It seems that `apartment` should be either `a` or `b` based on the context. I will assume that `apartment` is either `a` or `b`.

Assuming `apartment` is either `a` or `b`, the value of `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `apartment` can be either `a` or `b`, and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.

Since the value of `apartment` can be either `a` or `b`, I will consider both cases.

Case 1: `apartment` is `a`
In this case, the value of `block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. Since `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, the value of `block` will be an integer such that 1 ≤ block ≤ n.

Case 2: `apartment` is `b`
In this case, the value of `block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. Since `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k, the value of `block` will be an integer such that 1 ≤ block ≤ n.

In both cases, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` do not change. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers, 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b, and `block` is an integer such that 1 ≤ block ≤ n.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers, 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b, and `block` is an integer such that 1 ≤ block ≤ n**
