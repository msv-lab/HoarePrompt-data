`time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, where `floor_b` is the floor of location `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `floor_b` is a positive integer between 1 and `k`. Therefore, the value of `time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 (if `floor_b` is 1) to 5*(k-1).

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n*m*k`, `a`!= `b`, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values related to the location of `a` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values related to the location of `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 to 5*(k-1).

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n*m*k`, `a`!= `b`, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values related to the location of `a` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values related to the location of `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 to 5*(k-1)**
