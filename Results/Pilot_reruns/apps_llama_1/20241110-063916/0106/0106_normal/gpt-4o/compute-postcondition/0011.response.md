The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n*m*k`, and `a`!= `b`. After executing the function body, the function returns `total_time`, which is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, calculated based on the locations of `a` and `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, where n, m, and k are positive integers, and a and b are distinct positive integers within the range 1 to n*m*k, and returns the total time required to move from location a to location b in a 3D space with dimensions n, m, and k.**
