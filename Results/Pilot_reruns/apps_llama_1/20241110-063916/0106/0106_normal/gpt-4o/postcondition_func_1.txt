The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` and returns two values: `block` and `floor`. The calculations for `block` and `floor` depend on the values of global variables or constants `m` and `k`, which are not defined within the function. The function returns `block` and `floor` values based on the provided `apartment` number, but the relationship between the input and output values is not explicitly defined without knowing the values of `m` and `k`.
