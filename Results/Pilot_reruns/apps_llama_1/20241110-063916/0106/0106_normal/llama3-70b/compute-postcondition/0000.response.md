The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer using `map(int,...)`, and assigns the results to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are already positive integers, the code overwrites their values with new integer values from the input. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b**
