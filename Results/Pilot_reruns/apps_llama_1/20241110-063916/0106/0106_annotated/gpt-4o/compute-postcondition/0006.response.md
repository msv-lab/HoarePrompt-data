To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The code is:
```python
reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
```
From the initial state, we know that `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, and `block_a` and `block_b` are assigned values based on the location of `a` and `b`, respectively.

The expression `abs(block_a - block_b)` calculates the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n - abs(block_a - block_b)` calculates the "reverse" difference between the blocks, wrapping around the value of `n` if necessary. The `% n` operation ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to `n-1`.

The final result is multiplied by 15 to get the `reverse_walk_time`.

The output state is:
`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of `b`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, and `reverse_walk_time` is an integer equal to (n - absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`) modulo `n` multiplied by 15.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of `b`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, and `reverse_walk_time` is an integer equal to (n - absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`) modulo `n` multiplied by 15**
