The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an object that contains integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n*m*k and a ≠ b. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: `block` which is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `floor` which is an integer between 1 and `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function get_location is to accept an apartment object with specific integer constraints and return the block and floor numbers.


Functionality: **The function accepts an apartment object with specific integer constraints, returns the block and floor numbers.**
