Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

In the problem description, it is stated that Edward can choose the direction to walk around the house. However, in the code, the `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are calculated based on the absolute difference between the blocks of the two apartments, without considering the direction of the walk. This means that the code does not take into account the possibility of walking in the opposite direction, which could potentially be faster.

For example, if the apartments are located in blocks 1 and 4, and the house has 5 blocks, the code will calculate the direct walk time as 3*15 = 45 seconds and the reverse walk time as 2*15 = 30 seconds. However, if Edward walks in the opposite direction, the walk time would be 2*15 = 30 seconds, which is faster. The code does not consider this possibility and always chooses the minimum of the direct and reverse walk times, which may not be the optimal solution.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
