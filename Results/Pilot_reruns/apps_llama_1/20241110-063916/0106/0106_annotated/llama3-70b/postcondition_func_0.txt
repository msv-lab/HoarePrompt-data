The function accepts five input integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from the user, calculates the minimum time required to move between points `a` and `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, and prints the result. However, the function does not handle cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` is not a positive integer, or where `a` or `b` is not a positive integer within the range `1 <= a, b <= n*m*k`, and it does not handle cases where `a` is equal to `b`.
