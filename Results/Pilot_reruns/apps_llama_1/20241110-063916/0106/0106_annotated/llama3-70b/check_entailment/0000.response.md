Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum time required to move between two points in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`. The code takes into account the relative positions of the two points and calculates the minimum time required to move between them using the elevator and walking.

The annotations provided are helpful in understanding the code, but they do not provide any cases that are not actually valid. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at each point, and they agree with the code.

The code handles all potential cases correctly. It calculates the minimum time required to move between two points in a 3D space, taking into account the relative positions of the two points. The code also handles cases where the two points are in the same block or in different blocks.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For example, in the first example, the code correctly calculates the minimum time required to move from point 200 to point 6, which is 39 seconds.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description, and it handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
