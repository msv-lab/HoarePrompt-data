Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code calculates `min_block_time` based on the values of `a_block`, `b_block`, and `n`. 

`min_block_time` is assigned the value of the minimum between the absolute difference of `a_block` and `b_block` and `n` minus the absolute difference of `a_block` and `b_block`, multiplied by 15.

Since `a_block`, `b_block`, and `n` are input integers, their values are unknown. However, we can express `min_block_time` in terms of these variables.

`min_block_time` is either `abs(a_block - b_block) * 15` or `(n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is either `abs(a_block - b_block) * 15` or `(n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.**
