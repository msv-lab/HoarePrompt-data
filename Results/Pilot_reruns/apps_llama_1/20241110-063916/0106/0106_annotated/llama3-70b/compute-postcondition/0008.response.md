To calculate the output state, we need to determine the value of `min_floor_time` based on the given initial state.

From the initial state, we know that `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1` and `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`. However, we don't know the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, so we cannot calculate the exact values of `a_floor` and `b_floor`.

However, we can express `min_floor_time` in terms of `a_floor` and `b_floor`. The code calculates `min_floor_time` as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `a_floor` and `b_floor`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `min_floor_time`. However, we can say that `min_floor_time` is a function of `a_floor` and `b_floor`, and its value depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `a_block`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is either `abs(a_block - b_block) * 15` or `(n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, and `min_floor_time` is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is either `abs(a_block - b_block) * 15` or `(n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, and `min_floor_time` is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10**
