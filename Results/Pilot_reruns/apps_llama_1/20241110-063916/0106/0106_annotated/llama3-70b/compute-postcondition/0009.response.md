Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` are as described in the precondition. `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor`: if `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`; otherwise, `min_floor_time` is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. This calculation ensures that `min_floor_time` is always positive and takes into account the relative positions of `a_floor` and `b_floor`.***
