The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned to the input values, which are integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown, but we know they are positive integers. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k, and a!= b**
