The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `fractions`, and `fraction` are not affected, and `depublicans` is also not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `fraction` is the second character in the `fractions` string, `depublicans` is dependent on the value of `fraction`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.
