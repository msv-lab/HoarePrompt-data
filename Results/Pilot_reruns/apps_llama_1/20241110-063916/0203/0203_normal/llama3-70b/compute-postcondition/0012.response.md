According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. If the string has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` has at least 2 characters, and `fraction` is the second character in the `fractions` string.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `fractions` string must have at least 3 characters, and `fraction` must be the third character in the `fractions` string.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `fraction` is the third character in the `fractions` string**
