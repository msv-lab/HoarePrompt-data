To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters.
- `fraction` is the third character in the `fractions` string.

The loop statement is:
```
for fraction in fractions:
    # the loop body is omit
```
This loop iterates over each character in the `fractions` string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in `fractions` after the current `fraction`.

Since `fraction` is the third character, and we know `fractions` has at least 3 characters, for the loop to continue, `fractions` must have more than 3 characters. Additionally, `fraction` should be updated to the next character in the sequence, which would be the fourth character in `fractions`.

The states of `n`, `democrats`, and `republicans` do not directly affect the loop's continuation condition, which is based solely on the characters in `fractions`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `n` remains an input integer (no change needed).
- `fractions` must have at least 4 characters.
- `fraction` should be the fourth character in the `fractions` string.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least 4 characters, `fraction` is the fourth character in the `fractions` string.**
