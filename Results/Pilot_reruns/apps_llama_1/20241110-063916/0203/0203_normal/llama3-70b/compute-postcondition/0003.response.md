Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code declares a new variable `remocrats` and assigns it a value of 0.

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0.

The code does not affect the values of `n`, `fractions`, or `depublicans`. It only introduces a new variable `remocrats` with a value of 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
