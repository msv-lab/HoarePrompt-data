The function takes two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a string `fractions`. It calculates the number of 'D' characters and non-'D' characters in `fractions`, regardless of its length. If `fractions` is empty, it prints 'R'. Otherwise, it prints 'D' if the number of 'D' characters is greater than the number of non-'D' characters, and 'R' otherwise, including the case where the numbers are equal.
