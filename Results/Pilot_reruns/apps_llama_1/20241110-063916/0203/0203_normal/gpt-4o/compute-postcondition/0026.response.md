To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is `d_queue.append(d_index + n)`. This line of code appends the value `d_index + n` to the `d_queue`.

From the initial state, we know that `d_index` is the index of the next 'D' character in `votes`, and `n` remains unchanged. 

Since `n` remains unchanged, we can directly use `n` for the calculation. However, the value of `n` is not provided in the initial state. But we can still express the output state in terms of `n`.

The value `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. The initial state of `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least one more 'D' character. After appending `d_index + n`, `d_queue` will contain the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least two more 'D' characters.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `v`, `r_index`, and `r_queue` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the index of the next 'D' character in `votes`, `r_index` is the index of the next non-'D' character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least two more 'D' characters, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index` and has one less element.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the index of the next 'D' character in `votes`, `r_index` is the index of the next non-'D' character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least two more 'D' characters, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index` and has one less element.**
