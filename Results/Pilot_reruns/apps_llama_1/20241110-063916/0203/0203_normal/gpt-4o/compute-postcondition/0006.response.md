To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
r_queue.append(i)
```
The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `votes` is a non-empty input string
- `d_queue` is an empty list
- `r_queue` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `v` is the first character in `votes`

Now, let's think step by step:

- The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue` list.
- The value of `i` is 0.

After execution, the state of `r_queue` changes, and it now contains the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is a list containing 0, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first character in `votes`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is a list containing 0, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first character in `votes`.**
