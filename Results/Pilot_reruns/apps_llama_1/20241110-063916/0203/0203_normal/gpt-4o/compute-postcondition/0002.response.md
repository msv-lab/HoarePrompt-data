A new empty list called `d_queue` is created. The values of `n` and `votes` are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string, `d_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string, `d_queue` is an empty list**
