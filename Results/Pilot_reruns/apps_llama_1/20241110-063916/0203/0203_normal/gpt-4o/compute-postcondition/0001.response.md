The value of `votes` is reassigned to the result of `input().strip()`, which accepts a new input string and removes leading and trailing whitespace. The previous value of `votes` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'D's and 'R's) is discarded. The value of `n` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string**
