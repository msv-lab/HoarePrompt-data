The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The state of `n` remains unchanged. The state of `i` is also unchanged as it is the index of the last character in `votes`. The state of `v` is also unchanged as it is the last character in `votes`. The state of `d_index` is also unchanged as it is the first element that was in `d_queue`. The state of `r_index` is updated to the removed element from `r_queue`. The state of `r_queue` is also updated as its first element is removed.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the removed first element from `r_queue`, `r_queue` has its first element removed.**
