The value of `d_index` is assigned the value of the front element of `d_queue`, which is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`. The front element is removed from `d_queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes`, and `d_index` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`**
