To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is: `r_queue.append(r_index + n)`

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`.
- `v` is the last character in `votes`.
- `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.
- `r_index` is the removed first element from `r_queue`.
- `r_queue` has its first element removed.

Now, let's think step by step:
- The `append` method is called on `r_queue`, which adds a new element to the end of the queue.
- The new element is `r_index + n`.
- Since `n` remains unchanged, its value is still unknown, but it's used in the calculation.
- `r_index` is the removed first element from `r_queue`, so its value is known at this point.

The impact of the code on the program is:
- `r_queue` now has a new element, which is `r_index + n`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `v`, and `d_index` are not changed.
- The state of `r_queue` is updated with a new element.

The output state is:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`.
- `v` is the last character in `votes`.
- `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.
- `r_index` is the removed first element from `r_queue`.
- `r_queue` has its first element removed and a new element `r_index + n` appended.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the removed first element from `r_queue`, `r_queue` has its first element removed and a new element `r_index + n` appended**
