Output State: **The loop separates the indices of 'D' and non-'D' characters in the `votes` string into two separate queues, `d_queue` and `r_queue`, respectively. If `votes` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty lists. If `votes` is non-empty, `i` will be the index of the last character in `votes`, and `v` will be the last character in `votes`. The `d_queue` will contain the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes`, and the `r_queue` will contain the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes`. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.**
