To determine the output state, we need to consider the four possible scenarios based on the initial state of `votes` and `v`.

1. If the first character in `votes` is 'D' and `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 0, 1, and 2, and `r_queue` is an empty list. After executing `r_queue.append(i)`, `r_queue` will contain 2.

2. If the first character in `votes` is 'D' and `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and 1, and `r_queue` is a list containing 2. After executing `r_queue.append(i)`, `r_queue` will contain 2 and 2.

3. If the first character in `votes` is not 'D' and `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 1 and 2, and `r_queue` is an empty list. After executing `r_queue.append(i)`, `r_queue` will contain 2.

4. If the first character in `votes` is not 'D' and `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` is an empty list and `r_queue` is a list containing 0, 1, and 2. After executing `r_queue.append(i)`, `r_queue` will contain 0, 1, 2, and 2.

In all scenarios, `n` remains an input integer, `votes` remains a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `i` remains 2, and `v` remains the third character in `votes`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character in `votes`, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated as follows: if the first character in `votes` is 'D' and `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` is [0, 1, 2] and `r_queue` is [2]; if the first character in `votes` is 'D' and `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` is [0, 1] and `r_queue` is [2, 2]; if the first character in `votes` is not 'D' and `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` is [1, 2] and `r_queue` is [2]; if the first character in `votes` is not 'D' and `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` is [] and `r_queue` is [0, 1, 2, 2]**
