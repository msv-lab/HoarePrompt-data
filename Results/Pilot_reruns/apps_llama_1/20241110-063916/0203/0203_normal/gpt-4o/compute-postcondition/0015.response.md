Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character in `votes`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` is either [0, 1, 2, 2] or [0, 1, 2] or [1, 2, 2] or [2], and `r_queue` is either an empty list or a list containing 2 or a list containing 0, 1, and 2. If `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated as follows: if the first character in `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` is [0, 1] and `r_queue` is [2, 2]; if the first character in `votes` is not 'D', then `d_queue` is [] and `r_queue` is [0, 1, 2, 2].***
