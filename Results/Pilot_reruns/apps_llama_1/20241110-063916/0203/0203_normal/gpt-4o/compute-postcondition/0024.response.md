Let's analyze the code step by step:

* The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from the `d_queue` list and assigns it to the variable `d_index`.
* Since `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least one more 'D' character, removing the first element from `d_queue` means that `d_index` will now hold the index of the next 'D' character in `votes`.
* The state of `n`, `i`, `v`, `r_index`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged.
* The state of `d_queue` changes, as it now has one fewer element.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the index of the next 'D' character in `votes`, `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least one more 'D' character, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index` and at least one more non-'D' character**
