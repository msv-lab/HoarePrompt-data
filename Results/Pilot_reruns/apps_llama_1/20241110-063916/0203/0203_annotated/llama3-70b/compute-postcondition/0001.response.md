The code snippet `fractions = input()` assigns a new value to the variable `fractions`, which is the input provided by the user. The previous value of `fractions` was a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. However, the new value of `fractions` is not necessarily related to its previous value or the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string**
