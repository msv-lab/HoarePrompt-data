The code prints the string 'D'. The variables `depublicans`, `remocrats`, and `n` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that 'D' has been printed.

Output State: **`depublicans` is the number of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the number of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', `n` remains unchanged, and 'D' has been printed**
