To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the impact of the code on the program.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character
- `fraction` is the next character in the string
- If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is either 1 or 2 and `remocrats` is 0
- Otherwise, `depublicans` is either 0 or 1 and `remocrats` is either 1 or 2

The code increments `remocrats` by 1.

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

- If `fraction` is 'D', `remocrats` was 0, so after incrementing, `remocrats` is 1.
- If `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` was either 1 or 2, so after incrementing, `remocrats` is either 2 or 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character
- `fraction` is the next character in the string
- If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is either 1 or 2 and `remocrats` is 1
- Otherwise, `depublicans` is either 0 or 1 and `remocrats` is either 2 or 3

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `fraction` is the next character in the string, if `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is either 1 or 2 and `remocrats` is 1, otherwise, `depublicans` is either 0 or 1 and `remocrats` is either 2 or 3**
