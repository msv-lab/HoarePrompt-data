To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop iterates over the characters in the `fractions` string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in the string.

Given the current state, we know that `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character. This condition is already met, so we don't need to adjust the state of `fractions`.

However, we do need to consider the state of `fraction`, which is the next character in the string. For the loop to execute again, `fraction` should be the next character in the string.

Additionally, we should consider the states of `depublicans` and `remocrats`, which depend on the value of `fraction`. However, since we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to adjust these states yet. They will be updated based on the new value of `fraction` during the next iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `fraction`, which should be the next character in the string.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `fraction` is the next character in the string**
