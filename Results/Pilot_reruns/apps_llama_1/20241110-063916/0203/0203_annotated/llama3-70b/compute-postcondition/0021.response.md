It seems like there's an issue with the provided information. The function definition is incomplete, and the output description is missing. However, I'll provide a general outline of how to approach this problem based on the given parameter constraints.


The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. `n` is a positive integer, and `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'.


Since the output description is missing, I'll leave it blank for now. Once the output description is provided, I can help you complete the functionality description.


Please provide the output description, and I'll assist you in completing the functionality description in the required format.
