According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. If `fractions` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` is a non-empty string with the first character removed, and `fraction` is the next character in the string.

For the loop to execute one more time, `fractions` must have at least one more character after the current `fraction`. Therefore, `fractions` should be a non-empty input string with at least one more character, and `fraction` should be the next character in the string.

The states of `n`, `depublicans`, and `remocrats` do not affect the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `fraction` is the next character in the string. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is either 1 or 2 and `remocrats` is 0. Otherwise, `depublicans` is either 0 or 1 and `remocrats` is either 1 or 2.**
