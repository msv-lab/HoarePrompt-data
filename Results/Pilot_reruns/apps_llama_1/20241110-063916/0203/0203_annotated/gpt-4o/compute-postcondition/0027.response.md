To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
r_queue.append(r_index + n)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `d_queue` has at least one element.
- `r_queue` has at least no element.
- `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.
- `r_index` is the new first element that was in `r_queue`.
- `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string.
- `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:
- The `append` method is used to add an element to the end of the `r_queue`.
- The element being added is the result of `r_index + n`.

Since `r_index` is the new first element that was in `r_queue` and `n` remains unchanged, the value of `r_index + n` will be a new value that is being added to `r_queue`.

After the execution of the code, the state of the variables will be:
- `d_queue` still has at least one element.
- `r_queue` now has at least one element, which is `r_index + n`.
- `d_index` remains the same.
- `r_index` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `v` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`d_queue` has at least one element, `r_queue` has at least one element which is `r_index + n`, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the new first element that was in `r_queue`, `i` is the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` is the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
