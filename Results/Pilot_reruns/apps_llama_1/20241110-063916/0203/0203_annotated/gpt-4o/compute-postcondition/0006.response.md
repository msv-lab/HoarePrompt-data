The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of the `r_queue` list. 

Since `i` is 0, the `r_queue` list will now contain the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 1 character, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 1 character, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string**
