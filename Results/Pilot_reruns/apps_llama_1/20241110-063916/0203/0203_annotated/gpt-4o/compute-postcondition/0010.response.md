To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `votes` is a new input string with at least 2 characters
- `i` is 1
- `v` is the second character in the `votes` string
- If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and `r_queue` is an empty list
- Otherwise, `d_queue` is an empty list and `r_queue` is a list containing 0

The code to be executed is:
```python
r_queue.append(i)
```
This line of code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue` list.

Given that `i` is 1, the `r_queue` list will have 1 appended to it.

If `v` is 'D', the initial `r_queue` is an empty list, so after appending `i`, `r_queue` will be `[1]`. The `d_queue` remains unchanged as `[0]`.

If `v` is not 'D', the initial `r_queue` is a list containing 0, so after appending `i`, `r_queue` will be `[0, 1]`. The `d_queue` remains unchanged as an empty list `[]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `votes` is a new input string with at least 2 characters
- `i` is 1
- `v` is the second character in the `votes` string
- If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and `r_queue` is a list containing 1
- Otherwise, `d_queue` is an empty list and `r_queue` is a list containing 0 and 1

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string, `d_queue` is either [0] if `v` is 'D' or [] otherwise, and `r_queue` is either [1] if `v` is 'D' or [0, 1] otherwise**
