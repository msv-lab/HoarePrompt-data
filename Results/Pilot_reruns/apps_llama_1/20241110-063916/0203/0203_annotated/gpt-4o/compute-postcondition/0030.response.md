The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_index` was already the first element of `d_queue`, its value remains the same. However, `d_queue` now has one less element.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least one less element, `r_queue` has at least one element, `d_index` is the same as before (the first element that was in `d_queue`), `r_index` is the new first element that was in `r_queue`, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
