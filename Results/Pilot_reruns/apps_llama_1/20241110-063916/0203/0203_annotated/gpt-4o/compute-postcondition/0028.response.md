Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` have updated elements based on the comparison between `d_index` and `r_index`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has at least two elements with the last element being `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` remains empty. Otherwise, `d_queue` has at least one element, and `r_queue` has at least one element which is `r_index + n`. In both cases, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the new first element that was in `r_queue`, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged.***
