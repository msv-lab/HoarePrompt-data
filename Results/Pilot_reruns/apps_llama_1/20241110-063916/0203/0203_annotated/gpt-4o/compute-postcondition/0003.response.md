Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code creates a new empty list `r_queue`. 

The initial state has the following variables: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string, and `d_queue` is an empty list. The new code does not affect the values of `n`, `votes`, or `d_queue`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string, `d_queue` is an empty list, and `r_queue` is a new empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string, `d_queue` is an empty list, and `r_queue` is a new empty list**
