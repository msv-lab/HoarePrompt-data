The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. 

In the initial state, `d_queue` is an empty list and `i` is 0. 

After executing the code, `d_queue` will contain the value 0.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 1 character, `d_queue` is a list containing 0, `r_queue` is a new empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string**
