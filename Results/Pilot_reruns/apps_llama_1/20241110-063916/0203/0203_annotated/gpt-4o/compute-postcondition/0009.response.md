The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. The value of `i` is 1. 

If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` initially contains [0] and after appending `i`, it becomes [0, 1]. `r_queue` remains an empty list.

If `v` is not 'D', `d_queue` initially is an empty list and after appending `i`, it becomes [1]. `r_queue` remains a list containing [0].

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string. If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is a list containing [0, 1] and `r_queue` is an empty list. Otherwise, `d_queue` is a list containing [1] and `r_queue` is a list containing [0].

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string. If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is a list containing [0, 1] and `r_queue` is an empty list. Otherwise, `d_queue` is a list containing [1] and `r_queue` is a list containing [0].**
