The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters, the first element removed is the index of a non-'D' character. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has the first element removed, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` has the first element removed, `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character, `i` is the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` is the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
