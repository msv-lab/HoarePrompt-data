The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. 

Since `r_queue` has at least one element after the first element was removed, removing the first element will not make it empty. 

The state of `d_queue`, `d_index`, `i`, `v`, and `n` remains unchanged.

The new value of `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue` after the first element was removed.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least one element, `r_queue` has at least no element, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the new first element that was in `r_queue`, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
