The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This new value of `n` replaces the initial state value of `n`. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer is lost, and `n` now takes the new input value. The variable `votes` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
