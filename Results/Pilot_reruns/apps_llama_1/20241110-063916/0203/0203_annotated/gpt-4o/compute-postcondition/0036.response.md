Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop will execute until one of them becomes empty. After the loop finishes, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty, and the other will have elements that are the sum of the initial elements and `n`. If `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` will have all the remaining elements, and if `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` will have all the remaining elements. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are initially empty, the loop will not execute, and both will remain empty. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. The variables `i` and `v` are not modified by the loop and will retain their initial values.**
