The function accepts two inputs from the user: a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It then simulates a process where 'D' and non-'D' characters compete, and finally prints 'D' if the 'D' characters win or 'R' otherwise. The function handles edge cases where `votes` is empty or contains only 'D' or non-'D' characters, and also handles the case where `n` is 0.
