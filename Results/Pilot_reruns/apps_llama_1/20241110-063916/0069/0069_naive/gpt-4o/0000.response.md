Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string `t` with a balance equal to `x`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It first calculates the balance of the string `s` by counting the number of 0s and 1s.
2. It then creates an array `prefix_balances` to store the balance of each prefix of `s`.
3. If the balance of `s` is 0, it checks if `x` is in the `prefix_balances` array. If it is, it returns -1, indicating an infinite number of prefixes with balance `x`. If `x` is not in the array, it returns 0.
4. If the balance of `s` is not 0, it iterates over the `prefix_balances` array and checks if the difference between `x` and each balance is a multiple of the balance of `s`. If it is, it increments a count.
5. Finally, it returns the count.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If the balance of `s` is 0, it correctly checks for the presence of `x` in the `prefix_balances` array.
* If the balance of `s` is not 0, it correctly calculates the number of prefixes with balance `x` by checking for multiples of the balance.
* It handles the case where `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` array correctly by returning 0.
* It handles the case where `x` is in the `prefix_balances` array and the balance of `s` is 0 correctly by returning -1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
