The code `results.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the end of the `results` list. The values of the other variables (`T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, `_`, `i`, `balance`, `n`, `prefix_balances`, and `s`) are not affected.

Output State: **`T` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `_` is unchanged, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, `n` is unchanged, `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` values where each `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance of the substring `s[:i]`, `s` is unchanged, and `results` has an additional element with value `0`.**
