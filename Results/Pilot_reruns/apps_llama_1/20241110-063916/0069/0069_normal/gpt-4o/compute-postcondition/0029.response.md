Postcondition: ***`T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `i`, `n`, `s` remain unchanged, `prefix_balances` has at least one more element, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, `balance` is unchanged. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
