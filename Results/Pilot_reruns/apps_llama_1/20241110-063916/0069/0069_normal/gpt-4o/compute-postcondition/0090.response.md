Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `prefix_balances` list is not empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, and `balance` remain unchanged, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`. If the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 0.***
