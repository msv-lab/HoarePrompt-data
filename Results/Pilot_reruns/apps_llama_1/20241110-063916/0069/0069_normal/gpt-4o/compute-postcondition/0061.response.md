Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged and has at least 4 elements, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is a non-empty string and is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements and the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`, and the `results` list remains updated. If `(x - b)` is a multiple of `balance` and `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, then `count` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `count` remains 0.***
