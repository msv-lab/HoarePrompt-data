Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns a new value to the variable `n`. 

The value of `data[index]` is a substring read from the input, and `index` is 1. Since `data` is a list of substrings, `data[index]` is a substring. 

The `int()` function converts this substring to an integer. 

So, the value of `n` is now the integer value of the substring at index 1 in the `data` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring at index 1 in the `data` list, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 0-s and 1-s, `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is any value.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring at index 1 in the `data` list, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 0-s and 1-s, `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is any value**
