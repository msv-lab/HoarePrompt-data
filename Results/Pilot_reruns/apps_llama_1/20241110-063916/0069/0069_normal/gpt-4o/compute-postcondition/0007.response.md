Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code is `x = int(data[index + 1])`. 

The value of `index` is 1, so `index + 1` is 2. 

The value of `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, and `n` is the integer value of the substring at index 1 in the `data` list, so `data` has at least two substrings.

The value of `x` is assigned the integer value of the substring at index 2 in the `data` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring at index 1 in the `data` list, `x` is the integer value of the substring at index 2 in the `data` list, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 0-s and 1-s, `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is any value.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring at index 1 in the `data` list, `x` is the integer value of the substring at index 2 in the `data` list, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 0-s and 1-s, `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is any value**
