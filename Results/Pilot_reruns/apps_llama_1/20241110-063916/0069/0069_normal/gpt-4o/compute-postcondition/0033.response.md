To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop statement. The loop iterates over `prefix_balances`, and the loop variable is `b`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `b` has taken on one of the values in `prefix_balances`. For the loop to execute again, `b` should take on the next value in `prefix_balances`.

State: **`T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `prefix_balances`, `b` is the next value in `prefix_balances`, and `balance` remain unchanged. `count` is increased by 1 if `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.**
