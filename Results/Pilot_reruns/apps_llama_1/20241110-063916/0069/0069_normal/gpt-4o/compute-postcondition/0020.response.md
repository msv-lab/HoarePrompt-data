The value of `results` is modified by appending `-1` to the end of the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n`, and the value of `balance` remains the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`. The `prefix_balances` list still stores the prefix balances of the string `s`. The values of `T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `_` is unchanged, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` values where each `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance of the substring `s[:i]`, and `results` is the previous list with `-1` appended to the end**
