To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state describes a scenario where a loop calculates prefix balances of a string `s` and stores them in `prefix_balances`. However, the provided code snippet only shows `results.append(-1)`, which indicates that the value `-1` is being appended to a list named `results`.

Given the information:

- The loop calculating prefix balances and its effects on `prefix_balances`, `i`, `n`, `T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, and `balance` are not directly relevant to the execution of `results.append(-1)`.
- The code `results.append(-1)` directly affects the `results` list by adding `-1` to it.

Thus, the output state reflects the change in the `results` list, while the states of other variables (`prefix_balances`, `i`, `n`, `T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, and `balance`) remain as they were after the loop's execution.

Output State: **The `results` list has `-1` appended to it; other variables' states remain unchanged.**
