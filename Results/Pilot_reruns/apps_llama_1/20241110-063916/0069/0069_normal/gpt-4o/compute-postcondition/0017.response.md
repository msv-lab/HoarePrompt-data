The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is 3, so we are updating `prefix_balances[3]`. The value of `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2. The value of `s[2]` is either '0' or '1' since `x` is the integer value of the substring at index 2 in the `data` list.

If `s[2]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[3]` is `prefix_balances[2] + 1`, which can be 3, 1, or -1.

If `s[2]` is '1', then `prefix_balances[3]` is `prefix_balances[2] - 1`, which can be 1, -1, or -3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `x` is the integer value of the substring at index 2 in the `data` list, `s` is the substring at index 3 in the `data` list, `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is any value, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` values where `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1, `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2, and `prefix_balances[3]` is either 3, 1, -1, or -3, and `i` is 3.
