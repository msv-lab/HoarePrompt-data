`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The values of `T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, `n`, `prefix_balances`, `i`, and `balance` are not affected, so they remain unchanged. The `results` list also remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `balance` remains unchanged, and the `results` list is updated.**
