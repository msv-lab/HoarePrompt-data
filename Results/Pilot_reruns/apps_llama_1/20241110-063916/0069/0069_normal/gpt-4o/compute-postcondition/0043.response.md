The given code creates a new list `prefix_balances` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. This operation does not affect the values of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is a new list with `n + 1` zeros, `i` remains unchanged, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, and the `results` list remains updated**
