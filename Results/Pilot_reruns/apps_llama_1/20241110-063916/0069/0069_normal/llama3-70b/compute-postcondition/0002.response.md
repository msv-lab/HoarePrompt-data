The code uses the `map` function to convert two input values to integers and assigns them to `n` and `x`, respectively. The previous values of `n` and `x` are overwritten.

The input values are not specified, but we know that `n` and `x` will be assigned the values of two integers input by the user. The previous values of `T`, `s`, and `_` are not affected.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `_` is 0**
