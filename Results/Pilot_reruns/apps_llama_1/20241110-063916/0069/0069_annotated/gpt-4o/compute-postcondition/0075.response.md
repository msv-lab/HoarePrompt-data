Let's analyze the given code.

The code `prefix_balances = [0] * (n + 1)` creates a new list called `prefix_balances` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.

Since `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, the length of `prefix_balances` will be `int(data[index]) + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` is incremented by 3, `x` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `balance` is `count_0 - count_1`, `i` remains unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `results` remains unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 2]`.**
