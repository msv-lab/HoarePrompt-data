The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unchanged, so the output state is: `T` remains unchanged, `s` is a value based on `data[index + 2]`, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value based on `data[index]`, `x` is an integer value based on `data[index + 1]`, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, and `_` remains unchanged.
