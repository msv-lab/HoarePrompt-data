To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. The code is `x = int(data[index + 1])`.
2. From the initial state, we know that `index` is 1 and `data` is a list of words read from the standard input with the first word removed.
3. The expression `index + 1` evaluates to 2, because `index` is 1.
4. `data[index + 1]` refers to the second element of the `data` list (since indexing starts at 0).
5. The `int()` function converts the second element of the `data` list to an integer.
6. The result of the conversion is assigned to the variable `x`.

Considering the initial state and the code's effect, we can deduce the following:

- `T` remains a positive integer greater than 0.
- `n` remains an integer read from the standard input.
- `x` is now the integer value of the second element in the `data` list.
- `s` remains a string consisting of '0's and '1's of length `n`.
- `data` remains a list of words read from the standard input with the first word removed.
- `input` remains the remaining contents of the standard input.
- `index` remains 1.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `_` remains 0.

Since the value of `x` is now determined by the second element of the `data` list, and without knowing the exact value of this element, we can only state that `x` is the integer value of the second element in the `data` list.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, `x` is the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, `s` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's of length `n`, `data` is a list of words read from the standard input with the first word removed, `input` is the remaining contents of the standard input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
