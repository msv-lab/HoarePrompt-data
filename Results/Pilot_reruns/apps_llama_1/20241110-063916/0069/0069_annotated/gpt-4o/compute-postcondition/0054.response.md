Postcondition: ***The list `results` is updated based on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with `-1`. Otherwise, `results` is appended with `0`. The values of `T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, and `_` remain unchanged. The prefix balances of the string `s` are stored in `prefix_balances`, which may contain the prefix balances up to the `n`-th character if `n` is at least 1, or a list of `data[index] + 1` zeros if `n` is 0. The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is the difference between the count of '0' and '1' in the substring `s[:i]`.***
