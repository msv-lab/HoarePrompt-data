To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement and the given states.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is an integer value greater than 2. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

No other states need to be adjusted, as they are not relevant to the loop condition.

State: **`T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` is 4, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value greater than 3, `prefix_balances` is updated to one of the following: [0, 1, 2, 3,?], [0, 1, 2, 1,?], [0, 1, 0, 1,?], [0, 1, 0, -1,?], [0, -1, 0, 1,?], [0, -1, 0, -1,?], [0, -1, -2, -1,?], [0, -1, -2, -3,?], `results` remains unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 3]`.**
