To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is `results.append(-1)`. This line of code appends the value `-1` to the end of the list `results`.

From the initial state, we know that the loop calculates the prefix balances of the string `s` and stores them in the list `prefix_balances`. We also know that `T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the current value of `results`. But since we are appending a new value to `results`, its state will change.

Therefore, the output state is: The value of `results` is updated by appending `-1` to its end. The values of `T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The value of `results` is updated by appending `-1` to its end. The values of `T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, and `_` remain unchanged.**
