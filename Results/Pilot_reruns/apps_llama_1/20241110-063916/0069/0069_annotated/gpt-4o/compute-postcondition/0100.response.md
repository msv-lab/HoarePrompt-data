Postcondition: ***The prefix balances of a string `s` are stored in the list `prefix_balances`. The prefix balance at each index `i` is the sum of the prefix balances at the previous index `i-1` and 1 if the character at index `i-1` in `s` is '0', or -1 if the character is '1'. The list `results` is updated with an additional element: if `balance` is 0, the element is -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, and 0 otherwise; if `balance` is not 0, the element is the count of prefix balances `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. The values of `T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `s`, `n`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged.***
