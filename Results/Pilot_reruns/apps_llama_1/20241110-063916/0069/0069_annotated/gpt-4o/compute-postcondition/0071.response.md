`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The previous value of `x` is unknown, but the value of `index` and `data` are known to remain unchanged. The value of `data[index + 1]` is converted to an integer, but the exact value is unknown since `data` is not specified. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `x` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `x` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged**
