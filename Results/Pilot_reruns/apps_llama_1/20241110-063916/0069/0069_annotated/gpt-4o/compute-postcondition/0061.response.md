Postcondition: ***`T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged; `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with at least two elements; `n` is at least 1 or `data[index]` is at least 0; `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`. The value of `count` is 1 if `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, otherwise it remains 0, resulting in `count` being either 0, 1, or 2.***
