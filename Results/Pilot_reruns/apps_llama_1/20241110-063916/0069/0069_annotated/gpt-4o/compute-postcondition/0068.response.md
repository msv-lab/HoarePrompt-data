Postcondition: ***The values of `T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The prefix balances of the string `s` are stored in `prefix_balances`, which may contain the prefix balances up to the `n`-th character if `n` is at least 1, or a list of `data[index] + 1` zeros if `n` is 0. The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is the difference between the count of '0' and '1' in the substring `s[:i]`. If `balance` is 0, `results` is updated based on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`, appending `-1` if `x` is in `prefix_balances` and `0` otherwise. If `balance` is not 0, `results` is appended with the count of prefix balances in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0`.***
