The value of `index` is incremented by 3, and `index` has a value of 1. So, the new value of `index` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, `x` is the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, `s` is the fourth element in the `data` list, `data` is a list of words read from the standard input with the first word removed, `input` is the remaining contents of the standard input, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, `x` is the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, `s` is the fourth element in the `data` list, `data` is a list of words read from the standard input with the first word removed, `input` is the remaining contents of the standard input, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
