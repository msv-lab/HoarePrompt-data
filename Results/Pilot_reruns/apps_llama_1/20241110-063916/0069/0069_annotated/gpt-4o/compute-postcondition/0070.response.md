`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` is an integer value. The values of `T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged except for `_` which is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is now a specific integer value, but its exact value depends on the value of `data[index]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged**
