Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the program should calculate the number of prefixes of the infinite string t with balance equal to x. However, the code does not correctly handle the case when the balance of the string s is zero and x is not zero.

According to the code annotations, if cnt0 equals cnt1, the program will always print -1 because (x - balance) will always be divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), which is zero. However, this is not correct. If the balance of the string s is zero and x is not zero, the program should not print -1. Instead, it should print the number of prefixes of the infinite string t with balance equal to x.

For example, if the input is n = 2, x = 1, and s = "01", the balance of the string s is zero, but x is not zero. In this case, the program should print 0, because there are no prefixes of the infinite string t with balance equal to 1. However, the code will print -1, which is incorrect.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by pointing out the case when cnt0 equals cnt1, which led me to realize that the code does not correctly handle this case. However, I had to double-check the annotations to make sure they agree with the code and the problem description.
