To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: `T` is at least 3, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(n + 1)
```
This code snippet prints the value of `n + 1`. It does not modify any variables, so the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition that `n + 1` is printed.

Output State: **`T` is at least 3, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `n + 1` is printed**
