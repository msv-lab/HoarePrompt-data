Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 3, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance)` is a multiple of `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
