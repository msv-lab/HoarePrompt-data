Initial Assessment:

The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It checks if all the remainders of division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from 1 to `k` are distinct. The function `func_1` returns 'Yes' if all the remainders are distinct and 'No' otherwise. However, I can think of a few edge cases that the code might not be handling, such as when `k` is 0 or negative, or when `n` is 0 or negative.

Output Hints Analysis:

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior. They mention that the function does not handle the case where `k` is 0 or negative, and it does not account for the possibility of `n` being 0 or negative. They also mention that the function assumes that `n` and `k` are integers, but it does not validate this assumption. These are valid concerns and edge cases that the code does not handle.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The code does not handle the case where `k` is 0 or negative. In this case, the function should return 'Yes' because there are no remainders to check. However, the code does not handle this case and will throw an error or return an incorrect result.

Additionally, the code does not account for the possibility of `n` being 0 or negative. In this case, the function should return 'No' because the remainders are not distinct. However, the code does not handle this case and will throw an error or return an incorrect result.

The output hints provide these edge cases, and upon reviewing the code, it is clear that the code does not handle them correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
