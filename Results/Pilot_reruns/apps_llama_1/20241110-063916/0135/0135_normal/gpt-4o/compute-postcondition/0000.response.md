The function returns the string 'No'. The values of `n` and `k` do not change, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, and the function returns 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, and the function returns 'No'**
