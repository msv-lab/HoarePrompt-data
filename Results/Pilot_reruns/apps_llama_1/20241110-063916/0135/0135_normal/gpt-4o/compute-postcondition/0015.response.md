Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, here is the functionality of the function:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers n and k, and returns 'Yes' if there are no duplicate remainders when dividing n by integers from 1 to k and k is less than n; otherwise, it returns 'No'. However, the function does not handle the case where k is 0 or negative, and it does not account for the possibility of n being 0 or negative. Additionally, the function assumes that n and k are integers, but it does not validate this assumption. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No' without checking for duplicate remainders. If no duplicates are found, the function returns 'Yes'. **
