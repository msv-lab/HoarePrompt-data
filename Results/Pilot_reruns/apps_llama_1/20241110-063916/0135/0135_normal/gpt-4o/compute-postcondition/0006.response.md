Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set, `i` is an integer, and `remainder` is an integer. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the function continues execution with the current values of `n`, `k`, `seen_remainders`, `i`, and `remainder`.***
