To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is `range(1, k + 1)`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is an integer, we can increment it by 1 to satisfy this condition.

The other states, `n`, `seen_remainders`, and `remainder`, do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, and `remainder` is an integer**
