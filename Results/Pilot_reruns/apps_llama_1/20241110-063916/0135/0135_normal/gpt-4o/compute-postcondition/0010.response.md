The code `remainder = n % i` updates the value of `remainder`. The value of `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, and the value of `i` is an integer that has been incremented by 1. The modulus operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of `n` by `i`. Since `i` has been incremented by 1, its value is at least 2.

The value of `remainder` is now an integer between 0 and `i-1`, inclusive.

The values of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k > i-1, `seen_remainders` is a set, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and `i-1`, inclusive.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k > i-1, `seen_remainders` is a set, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and `i-1`, inclusive**
