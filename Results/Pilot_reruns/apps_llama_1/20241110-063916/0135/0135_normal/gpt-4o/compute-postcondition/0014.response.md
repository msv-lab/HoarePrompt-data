The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n and 1 <= k <= 10^18. 

After executing the function body, there are three possible cases:

Case 1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.

Case 2: If `k` is less than `n`, the function checks for duplicate remainders when dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k`. If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'.

Case 3: If no duplicates are found and `k` is less than `n`, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= n and 1 <= k <= 10^18, and return 'Yes' if there are no duplicate remainders when dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k` and `k` is less than `n`; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, returns 'Yes' if there are no duplicate remainders when dividing n by integers from 1 to k and k is less than n; otherwise, it returns 'No'.**
