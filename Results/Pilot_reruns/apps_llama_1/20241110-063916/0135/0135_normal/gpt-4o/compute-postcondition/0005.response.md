The function returns the string 'No'. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function returns 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function returns 'No'**
