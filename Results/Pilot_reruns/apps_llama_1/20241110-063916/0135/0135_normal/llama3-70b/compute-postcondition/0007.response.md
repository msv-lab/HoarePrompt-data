The code adds the current value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The previous value of `remainder` is 0, so 0 is added to the set `seen`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and `seen` is a set containing 0**
