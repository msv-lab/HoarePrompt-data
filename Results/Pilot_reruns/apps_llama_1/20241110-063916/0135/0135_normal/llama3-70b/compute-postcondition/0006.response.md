Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and initially `remainder` is 0 and `seen` is an empty set. If `remainder` is found in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' and terminates. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the current state of `n`, `k`, `i`, `remainder`, and `seen`.***
