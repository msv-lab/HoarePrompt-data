According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `seen` is an empty set, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `k` is at least 1 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
