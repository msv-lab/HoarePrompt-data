According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented and the condition `i` less than `k + 1` must still be true. This means `k` must be at least 3.

No changes are needed for `n`, `seen`, and `remainder` as they are not used in the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is either {0} or {0, 1}, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
