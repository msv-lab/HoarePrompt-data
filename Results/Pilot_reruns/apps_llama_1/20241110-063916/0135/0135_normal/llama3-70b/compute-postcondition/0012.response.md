Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 2. If `remainder` is in the set `seen`, the program terminates immediately, prints 'No', and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, the program continues execution, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0.***
