To solve this problem, we need to understand what the `exit()` function does in Python. The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program. When `exit()` is called, the program stops executing, and no further code is run.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

- `n` is an input integer: This variable's value is determined by user input, but its value does not change due to the `exit()` function.
- `k` is at least 3: The value of `k` does not change due to the `exit()` function.
- `i` is 3: The value of `i` does not change due to the `exit()` function.
- `seen` is either {0} or {0, 1}: The value of `seen` does not change due to the `exit()` function.
- `remainder` is either 0, 1, or 2: The value of `remainder` does not change due to the `exit()` function.
- 'No' is printed: This is an output that occurred before the `exit()` function was called, and it does not affect the state of the variables.

Since the `exit()` function terminates the program, no further code is executed, and the state of the variables remains the same. However, the program itself is terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is either {0} or {0, 1}, `remainder` is either 0, 1, or 2, 'No' is printed, and the program is terminated.**
