To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1.

The code snippet is: `remainder = n % i`

Now, let's think step by step:

- The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i`.
- The value of `n` is an input integer, and the value of `i` is 1.
- When we calculate `n` modulo 1, the remainder is always 0, because any integer divided by 1 leaves a remainder of 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
