Based on the problem description and the code, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The code checks if the remainders of `n` divided by all numbers from 1 to `k` are unique by using a set to store the remainders. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

After reviewing the output hints, I see that they agree with the code. The hints mention that the function checks if the remainders are unique and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. The hints also mention that the function may raise exceptions or produce undefined behavior for invalid or out-of-range inputs, but this is not a concern since the problem description specifies that the inputs are integers between 1 and 10^18.

I have checked the examples provided in the problem description, and the code produces the correct output for both examples. I have also tried to think of edge cases that the code might not be handling, but I couldn't find any.

Therefore, my conclusion is that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
