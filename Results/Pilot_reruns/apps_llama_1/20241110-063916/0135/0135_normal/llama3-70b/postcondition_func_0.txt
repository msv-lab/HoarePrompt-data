The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` as input from the user, checks if the remainders of `n` divided by all numbers from 1 to `k` are unique, and prints 'Yes' if all remainders are unique or 'No' if a duplicate remainder is found, but may raise exceptions or produce undefined behavior for invalid or out-of-range inputs.
