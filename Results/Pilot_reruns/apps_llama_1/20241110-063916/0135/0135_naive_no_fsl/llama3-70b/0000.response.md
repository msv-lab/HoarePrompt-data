Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly checks whether all the remainders of `n` divided by all integers `i` from 1 to `k` are distinct. Here's why:

1. The program initializes an empty set `seen` to store the remainders it has seen so far.
2. It then iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
3. For each `i`, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` using the modulo operator (`n % i`).
4. It checks if this remainder is already in the `seen` set. If it is, it means that the remainder has been seen before, and the program prints "No" and exits.
5. If the remainder is not in the `seen` set, it adds it to the set.
6. If the program completes the iteration over all `i` without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints "Yes".

This algorithm is correct because it checks all possible remainders of `n` divided by all integers `i` from 1 to `k`, and it uses a set to efficiently keep track of the remainders it has seen so far. The use of a set allows the program to check for duplicates in constant time, making the algorithm efficient even for large values of `n` and `k`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work correctly. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, and I couldn't think of any other edge cases that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
