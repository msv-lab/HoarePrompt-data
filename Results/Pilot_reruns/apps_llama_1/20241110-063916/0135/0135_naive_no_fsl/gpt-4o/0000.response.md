Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether all remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are the input values.
2. The program first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If this condition is true, it immediately returns 'No' because the remainders will not be distinct (for example, `n % n` will always be 0, and `n % 1` will always be 0).
3. If `k` is less than `n`, the program initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders it has seen so far.
4. The program then iterates over the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive). For each integer `i` in this range, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` using the modulo operator (`n % i`).
5. If the remainder is already in the `seen_remainders` set, the program immediately returns 'No' because it has found a duplicate remainder.
6. If the remainder is not in the `seen_remainders` set, the program adds it to the set and continues to the next iteration.
7. If the program completes the iteration over the range without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes' because all remainders are distinct.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, in which case the remainders will not be distinct.
* When `k` is less than `n`, in which case the program checks each remainder individually to ensure they are distinct.
* When `n` is 1, in which case the only remainder is 0, and the program correctly returns 'No' because the remainders are not distinct.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately solves the problem as described.
