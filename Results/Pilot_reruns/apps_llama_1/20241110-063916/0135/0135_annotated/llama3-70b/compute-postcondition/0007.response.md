Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The code `seen.add(remainder)` adds the current value of `remainder` to the set `seen`.
2. Since `remainder` is initially 0, it is added to the set `seen`.
3. The value of `remainder` is still 0, but now it is also an element of the set `seen`.
4. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this code.
5. The program does not print 'No' or terminate because `remainder` is not in `seen` before this line of code is executed, and this line of code only adds `remainder` to `seen`, it does not check if `remainder` is in `seen`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and `seen` is a set containing 0.**
