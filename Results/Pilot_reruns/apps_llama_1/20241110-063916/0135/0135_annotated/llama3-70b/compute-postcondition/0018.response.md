Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1. If `remainder` is in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' to the console and terminates immediately. Otherwise, the program continues execution without printing 'No' or terminating.***
