The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, so the values of the variables do not change. However, the program stops executing.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, `seen` is a set containing 0, and the program terminates.**
