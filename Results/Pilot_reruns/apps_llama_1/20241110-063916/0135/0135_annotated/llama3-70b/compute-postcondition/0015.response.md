To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is: `remainder = n % i`

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is at least 3.
- `i` is 2.
- `remainder` is 1.
- `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1.

The operation `n % i` calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. Since `i` is 2, this operation will give us the remainder of `n` divided by 2.

The possible values of `n % i` can be 0 or 1 because `i` is 2. This means `remainder` will be either 0 or 1 after the operation.

The values of `k` and `seen` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1**
