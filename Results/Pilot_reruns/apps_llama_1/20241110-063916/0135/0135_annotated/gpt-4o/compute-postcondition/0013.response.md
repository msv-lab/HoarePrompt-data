Based on the initial state, the loop has already checked if the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k` are unique. If a duplicate remainder was found, the function would have returned 'No' and the current return statement would not be executed. However, since the function has reached this point, it means that the loop completed without finding a duplicate remainder.

The current return statement `return 'Yes'` returns the string 'Yes'. The values of `i`, `remainder`, and `seen_remainders` do not change, but they are not relevant to the return statement.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `k`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `k`, `seen_remainders` is a set of unique remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and the function returns 'Yes'**
