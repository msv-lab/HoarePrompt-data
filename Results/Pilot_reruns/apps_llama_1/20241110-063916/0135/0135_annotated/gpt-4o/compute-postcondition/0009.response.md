To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop condition, which is `i` ranging from 1 to `k` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer + 1. To execute the loop again, `i` must be within the range of 1 to `k`. Since `i` is already an integer + 1, we need to increment it by 1 to make it eligible for the next iteration.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `seen_remainders`, and `remainder` do not affect the loop condition directly. However, since `remainder` is an integer between 0 and `i-1`, inclusive, we need to adjust its range to be between 0 and `i`, inclusive, to reflect the new value of `i`.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set, `i` is an integer + 2, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and `i`, inclusive**
