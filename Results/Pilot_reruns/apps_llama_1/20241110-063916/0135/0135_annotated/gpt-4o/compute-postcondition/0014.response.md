The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. 

After executing the function body, 
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. 
- Otherwise, the function checks if the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k` are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. 
- If the loop completes without finding a duplicate remainder, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` and return 'Yes' if the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k` are unique and `k` is less than `n`; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, returns 'Yes' if the remainders of n divided by numbers from 1 to k are unique and k is less than n; otherwise, it returns 'No'.**
