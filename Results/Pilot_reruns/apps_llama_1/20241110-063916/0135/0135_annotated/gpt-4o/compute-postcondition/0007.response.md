According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set, `i` is an integer + 1, and `remainder` is an integer.**
