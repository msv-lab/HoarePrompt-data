The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, returns 'No' if the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from `1` to `k` are not unique, returns 'Yes' if the remainders are unique and `k` is less than `n`, returns 'Yes' if `k` is `0`, and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `n` is `0`.
