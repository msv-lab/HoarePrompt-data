Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether all the remainders of division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from 1 to `k` are distinct. The function `func_1` iterates over the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive) and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each `i`. It uses a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders it has seen so far. If it encounters a remainder that is already in the set, it immediately returns 'No', indicating that the remainders are not distinct. If it completes the iteration without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes'.

The program handles the edge case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n` by immediately returning 'No', since in this case the remainders cannot be distinct (the remainder of `n` divided by `n` is 0, which is also the remainder of `n` divided by 1).

The program also handles the case where `n` and `k` are large integers (up to 10^18) correctly, since it uses the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder, which works correctly for large integers in Python.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and it handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
