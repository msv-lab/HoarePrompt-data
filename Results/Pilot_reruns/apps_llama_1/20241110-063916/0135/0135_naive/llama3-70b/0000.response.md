Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether all the remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. It iterates over the range from 1 to `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by the current integer `i`, and checks if the remainder is already in the `seen` set. If it is, the program prints "No" and exits, indicating that the remainders are not distinct. If the program completes the iteration without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints "Yes".

I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work correctly. The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` or `k` is 1, and it also handles the case where `n` is less than `k`. The use of a set to keep track of seen remainders ensures that the program has a time complexity of O(k), which is efficient for the given constraints.
