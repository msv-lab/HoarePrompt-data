The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a` of length `n`, and returns the number of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by subtracting one element from another element in `assigned`, plus 1, if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.
