The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, `assigned` is a set containing the two smallest elements of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second smallest element of `a`, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
