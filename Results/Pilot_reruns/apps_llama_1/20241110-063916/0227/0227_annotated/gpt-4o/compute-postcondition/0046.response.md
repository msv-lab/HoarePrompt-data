The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
