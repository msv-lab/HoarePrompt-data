The code assigns `True` to the variable `can_form`. The previous value of `can_form` is `False`, so this assignment changes its value. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 2**
