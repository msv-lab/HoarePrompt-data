Postcondition: ***`m` is increased by 1, `assigned` includes `a[i]` and has at least three elements, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is the third element in the `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of `can_form` is unchanged.***
