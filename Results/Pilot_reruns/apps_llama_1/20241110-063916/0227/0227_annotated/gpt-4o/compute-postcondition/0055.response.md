Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, where `x` is the third element in the `assigned` list and `i` is at least 3, otherwise `can_form` remains False. `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` has at least 3 elements, and `n` is greater than 2. If `can_form` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.***
