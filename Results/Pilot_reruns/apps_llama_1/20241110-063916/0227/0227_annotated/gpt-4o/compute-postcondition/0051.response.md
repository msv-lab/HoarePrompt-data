Postcondition: ***`can_form` is initially False, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the `assigned` list, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the innermost loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
