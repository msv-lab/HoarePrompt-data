Postcondition: ***`m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, otherwise `m` remains unchanged. `i` is at least 3, and `n` is greater than 2. If `assigned` is not empty, `can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, otherwise `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False.***
