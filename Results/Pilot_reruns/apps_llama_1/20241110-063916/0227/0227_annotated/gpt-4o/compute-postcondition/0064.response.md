The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of distinct positive integers of length `n`. 

After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the value of `n`. 

Case_1: If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns `m`, where `m` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by subtracting one element from another element in `assigned`.

Case_2: If `n` is 1 or less, the function returns 1, where `assigned` contains only the smallest element of `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a` of length `n`, and return the number of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by subtracting one element from another element in `assigned` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise return 1.
