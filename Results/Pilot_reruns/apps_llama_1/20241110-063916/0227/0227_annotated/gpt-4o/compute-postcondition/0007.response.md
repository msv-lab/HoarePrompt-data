The code sets `can_form` to `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, but the values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, `assigned` is a set containing the smallest element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the smallest element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, `assigned` is a set containing the smallest element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the smallest element of `a`.**
