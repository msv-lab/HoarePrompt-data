To solve this problem, let's think step by step:

1. `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. 
2. The previous value of `can_form` is `False`, but this does not affect the new value.
3. The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

The output state is: `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` includes `a[i]` and has at least one element, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list.

Output State: **`m` is increased by 1, `assigned` includes `a[i]` and has at least one element, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list**
