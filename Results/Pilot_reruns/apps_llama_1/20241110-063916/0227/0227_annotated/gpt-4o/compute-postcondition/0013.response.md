Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, `assigned` is a set containing the two smallest elements of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second smallest element of `a`. If the difference between the current element of `a` and `x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `can_form` remaining False.***
