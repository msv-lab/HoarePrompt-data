The code adds the first element of the list `a` to the set `assigned`. Since `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, the first element `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, `assigned` is a set containing the smallest element of `a`**
