Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, `assigned` is a set containing the two smallest elements of `a`, `m` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the smallest element of `a`. If the difference between the current element of `a` and the smallest element `x` is in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and we break out of the loop. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged. Additionally, this implies that if the difference is not in the set `assigned`, the loop will continue to the next iteration, and if the loop completes without finding a difference in the set `assigned`, `can_form` will remain False.***
