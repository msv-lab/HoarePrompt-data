Based on the provided code and annotations, I will attempt to describe the functionality of the function.

The function `func` accepts no parameters but takes two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. The function sorts the list `a` in ascending order.

The function then iterates through the sorted list `a` starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, it checks if the current element is not twice the previous element. If this condition is true, it increments a counter `m` by 1.

After the iteration, the function prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.

However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the annotations and the code do not entirely match. The annotations suggest that the function returns the value of `m` or -1, but the code actually prints the value instead of returning it. Additionally, the annotations do not mention the case where `n` is 0 or 1, but the code handles this case by not executing the loop and printing the value of `m` (which is 1) or -1.

Considering these observations, I will provide a summary of the functionality that covers all potential cases:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` in ascending order and iterates through the sorted list to count the number of times an element is not twice the previous element. The function then prints the count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1. **
