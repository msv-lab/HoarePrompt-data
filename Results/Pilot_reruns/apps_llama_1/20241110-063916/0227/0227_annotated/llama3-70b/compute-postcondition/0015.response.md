Based on the initial state, the code prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1.

If `n` is at least 2, `m` is the number of times an element in `a` is not twice the previous element, plus 1. This means that `m` is already calculated and has a value.

If `m` is less than or equal to 23, the code prints the value of `m`. In this case, the output state is that the value of `m` is printed, and the values of `a` and `n` remain the same.

If `m` is greater than 23, the code prints -1. In this case, the output state is that -1 is printed, and the values of `a` and `n` remain the same.

If `n` is 0 or 1, the loop does not execute, and `m` is 1. In this case, the code prints 1, and the values of `a` and `n` remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` remains a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `n` is the input integer, and the value of `m` (if `m` <= 23) or -1 (if `m` > 23) is printed.

Output State: **`a` remains a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `n` is the input integer, and the value of `m` (if `m` <= 23) or -1 (if `m` > 23) is printed**
