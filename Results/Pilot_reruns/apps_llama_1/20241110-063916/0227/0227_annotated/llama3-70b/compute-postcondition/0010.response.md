To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 3
- `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers
- `i` is 2
- `m` is either 2 or 3 if the third element of `a` is not twice the second element; otherwise, `m` remains either 1 or 2

Loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To execute the loop one more time, the condition `i < n` must be satisfied. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop condition is met.

The state of `a` (being a sorted list of distinct positive integers) and the conditions around `m` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute again. Therefore, these states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

However, considering the logic and the need to reflect the progression of the loop, if we are adjusting the state for the next iteration, we should also consider how `m` would be affected if the loop body were executed again. But since the question focuses on the condition for the loop to execute again rather than the specifics of how `m` changes, we'll focus on the critical conditions for loop continuation.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `i` is 3, `m` is either 2 or 3**
