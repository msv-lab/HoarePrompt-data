Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations. 

The issue with the program is that it assumes that if the current number is not twice the previous number, it needs an additional variable. However, this is not necessarily true. The program does not check if the current number can be obtained by adding two previously computed numbers.

For example, consider the input `4 2 3 5`. The program will output `3`, but the correct answer is `2`. This is because we can compute `4` and `2` using one variable, and then compute `3` and `5` using the second variable.

A correct implementation would need to check all possible combinations of previously computed numbers to see if the current number can be obtained by adding two of them. This would require a more complex algorithm, possibly involving dynamic programming or recursion.
