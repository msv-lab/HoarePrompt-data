Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged, `x` is the next element in the `assigned` set, and `assigned` set has at least one element. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, no changes are made to `can_form` and the loop continues. The state of `can_form` is determined based on the presence of `a[i] - x` in the `assigned` set.***
