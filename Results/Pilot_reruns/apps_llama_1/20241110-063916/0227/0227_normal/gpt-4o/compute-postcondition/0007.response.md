The value of `can_form` is changed to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 23, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, where each integer is less than or equal to 10^9, `assigned` is a set containing at least the smallest integer from list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is `True`, `x` is equal to the smallest integer from list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 23, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, where each integer is less than or equal to 10^9, `assigned` is a set containing at least the smallest integer from list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is `True`, `x` is equal to the smallest integer from list `a`.**
