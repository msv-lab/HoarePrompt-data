The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `m` was not explicitly mentioned, so we assume it had some value. The new value of `m` is the old value plus 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`, `assigned`, and `can_form`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is unchanged, `assigned` is unchanged, and `can_form` is unchanged**
