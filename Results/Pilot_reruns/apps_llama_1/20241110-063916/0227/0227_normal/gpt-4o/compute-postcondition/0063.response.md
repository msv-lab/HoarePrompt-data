The function returns `m`, and `m` stores the count of distinct sums that can be formed using the integers in list `a`. The final value of `m` is the number of distinct sums that can be formed using the integers in `a`. The `assigned` set contains all integers from `a`, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. The value of `n` can be 0, 1, or greater than 1, and the corresponding values of `m` and `assigned` are determined accordingly.

Output State: **`m` is the number of distinct sums that can be formed using the integers in `a`, `assigned` contains all integers from `a`, `i` is `n-1`, and the function returns `m`.**
