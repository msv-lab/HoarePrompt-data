Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 23, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, where each integer is less than or equal to 10^9, `assigned` is a set containing at least the smallest integer from list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to the smallest integer from list `a`. If the difference between the integer at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_form` remains `False`.***
