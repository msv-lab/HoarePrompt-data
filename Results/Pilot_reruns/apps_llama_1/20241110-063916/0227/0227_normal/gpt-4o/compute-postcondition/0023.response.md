According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains unchanged, which means it is still less than `n`. However, the loop will only execute again if `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is the previous value plus 1. Since the loop starts from 1, the new value of `i` should be at least 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is at least 2, `assigned` set has an additional element `a[i]`, `can_form` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged**
