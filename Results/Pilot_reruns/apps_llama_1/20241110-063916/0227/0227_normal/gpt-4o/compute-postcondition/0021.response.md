Postcondition: ***If the `assigned` set is not empty and the difference between the current element in list `a` and any element in the `assigned` set is also in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to `True` and `m` remains unchanged. If the `assigned` set is not empty but the difference is not in the `assigned` set, or if the `assigned` set is empty, then `can_form` remains `False` and `m` is increased by 1. In all cases, the values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the `assigned` set remains unchanged.***
