Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged, `x` is an element in the `assigned` set, and `assigned` set has at least one element. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of `can_form` remains unchanged as `False`.***
