The function takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers as input, sorts the list, and counts the number of times an element is not twice the previous element. It then prints the count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle non-integer or duplicate values in the input list, and it does not return a value.
