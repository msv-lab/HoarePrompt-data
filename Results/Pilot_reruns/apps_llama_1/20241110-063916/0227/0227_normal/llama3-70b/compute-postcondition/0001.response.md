The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reassigns the value of `a` by taking a new input, splitting it into integers, and storing them in a list.

The initial state of `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, but this is overwritten by the new input. The value of `n` is not used in this code snippet.

The new value of `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, but the exact values are unknown. The length of the list is also unknown, as it depends on the number of integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of unknown integers**
