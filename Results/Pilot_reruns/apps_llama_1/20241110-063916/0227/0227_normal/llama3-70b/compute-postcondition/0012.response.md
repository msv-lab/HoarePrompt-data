Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` multiplied by 2, then `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `m` remains unchanged, which is either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value of `m` and the relationship between `a[i - 1]` and `a[i - 2]`.***
