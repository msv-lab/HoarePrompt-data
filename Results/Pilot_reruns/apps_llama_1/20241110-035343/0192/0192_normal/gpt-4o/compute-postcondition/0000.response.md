The given Python code snippet uses the built-in `map` function to convert input values to integers and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The `input().split()` function splits the input into two parts, assuming the input is provided in the format "x y" where x and y are integers. 

However, since the initial state already specifies that x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100000, it seems that the code is trying to reassign new values to x and y from the input.

The new values of x and y will be the input integers. The previous constraint that 3 <= y < x <= 100000 may or may not hold true for the new values of x and y, depending on the input provided.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers**
