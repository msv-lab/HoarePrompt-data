It seems like the provided code snippet is incomplete, as the function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, I will describe the functionality of the function.


The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, and they must satisfy the condition 3 <= y < x <= 100,000.


Since the output is not provided, I will assume that the functionality of the function is to validate the input parameters and return a value based on the relationship between `x` and `y`. However, without the output information, I can only describe the input parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, x and y, where 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, and returns a value based on their relationship.**
