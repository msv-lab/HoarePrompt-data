Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func` appears to be defined without any parameters, but it uses the `input()` function to read two integers `x` and `y`. I will assume that the function should accept two parameters `x` and `y` as mentioned in the problem statement.

The function calculates the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` and prints the result. This expression can be simplified to `x - y`.

However, the annotations mention that the function should accept two parameters `x` and `y` such that `3 <= y < x <= 100000`. This constraint is not enforced in the code.

Considering the code and the annotations, I will provide a summary of the function's functionality:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two input integers `x` and `y` (although it is not explicitly defined as such), calculates the difference `x - y`, and prints the result. Note that the code does not enforce the constraint `3 <= y < x <= 100000` mentioned in the annotations. **
