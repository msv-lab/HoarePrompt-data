Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it uses the `input()` function to read two integers from the user. The annotations mention that `x` and `y` are input integers, but they also mention that `3 <= y < x <= 100000`, which is not enforced by the code.

The code then calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using the `abs()` function and prints the result.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The code does not check if the input values are valid integers. If the user enters something that cannot be converted to an integer, the code will raise a `ValueError`.
* The code does not check if the input values satisfy the condition `3 <= y < x <= 100000`. If the user enters values that do not satisfy this condition, the code will still calculate and print the absolute difference.
* The code does not handle the case where `x` and `y` are equal. In this case, the absolute difference will be 0, but the code will still print 0.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers from the user, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result, without enforcing any specific range or relationship between the input values, and without handling invalid input or edge cases. **
