The value of `B` is updated by performing integer division of `B` by `g`. The value of `B` was `2^(n*k)` taken modulo `MOD`, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Since the value of `g` is not explicitly given, we cannot calculate the exact value of `B`. However, we can express the new value of `B` as `B` is the quotient of `2^(n*k)` taken modulo `MOD` divided by the return value of `func_1(A, B)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 0, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or 1, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, taken modulo `MOD`, `p_no_shared` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or 1, `p_total` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, taken modulo `MOD`, `p_shared` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or a value within the range of 0 to `MOD-1`, `A` is either the quotient of the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, divided by `g`, or the quotient of a value within the range of 0 to `MOD-1` divided by `g`, `B` is the quotient of `2^(n*k)` taken modulo `MOD` divided by the return value of `func_1(A, B)`, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`.**
