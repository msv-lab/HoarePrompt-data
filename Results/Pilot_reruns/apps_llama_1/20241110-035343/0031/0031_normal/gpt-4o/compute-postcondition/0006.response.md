`denominator` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1**
