The function `func_1(A, B)` is called with arguments `A` and `B`. The value of `A` can be either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or a value within the range of 0 to `MOD-1`, and the value of `B` is `2^(n*k)` taken modulo `MOD`. 

Since the function `func_1(A, B)` is not defined in the given code, we assume that it returns a value based on the input arguments `A` and `B`. 

The output state is: `n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 0, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or 1, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, taken modulo `MOD`, `p_no_shared` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or 1, `p_total` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, taken modulo `MOD`, `p_shared` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or a value within the range of 0 to `MOD-1`, `A` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or a value within the range of 0 to `MOD-1`, `B` is `2^(n*k)` taken modulo `MOD`, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`.
