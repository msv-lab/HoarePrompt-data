The code assigns the value of `denominator` to `p_total`. The value of `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, taken modulo `MOD`. Since `total_days` is `2^n` and `MOD` is 1000003, the value of `denominator` is `(2^n)^k` modulo 1000003.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 0, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or 1, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, taken modulo `MOD`, `p_no_shared` is either the product of (`total_days - i`) for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, taken modulo `MOD`, or 1, and `p_total` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, taken modulo `MOD`.**
