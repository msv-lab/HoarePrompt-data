To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is `i in range(k)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is an integer >= 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` from 0 to 1. The other states (`n`, `k`, `MOD`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator`) do not affect the loop condition and can remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is `2^n` % 1000003, `denominator` is `2^n` % 1000003, `i` is 1**
