The code defines a constant `MOD` and assigns it the value `10 ** 6 + 3`. This value is calculated as `10` raised to the power of `6`, which equals `1000000`, and then `3` is added to it, resulting in `1000003`.

The initial state of `n` and `k` is not affected by this code, as it only defines a new constant `MOD`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003**
