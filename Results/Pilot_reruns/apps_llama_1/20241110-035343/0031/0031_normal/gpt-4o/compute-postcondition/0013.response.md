To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is an integer >= 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

The other variables (`n`, `MOD`, `total_days`, `numerator`, `denominator`) do not affect the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is ((`2^n` % 1000003) * (`2^n` - 1)) % 1000003, `denominator` is (`2^n` % 1000003) * `2^n` % 1000003, `i` is 2**
