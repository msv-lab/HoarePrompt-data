The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. The initial value of `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `2n`, and the value of `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` is (2^(2n)) * (2^n) = 2^(2n + n) = 2^(3n). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is ((2^n) * (2^n - 1)) * (2^n - 2), `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `3n`, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is ((2^n) * (2^n - 1)) * (2^n - 2), `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `3n`, and `i` is 2**
