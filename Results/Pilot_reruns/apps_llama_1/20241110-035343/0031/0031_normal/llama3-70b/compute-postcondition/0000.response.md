The code `total_days = 2 ** n` assigns the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` to the variable `total_days`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, the value of `total_days` will be a large integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.**
