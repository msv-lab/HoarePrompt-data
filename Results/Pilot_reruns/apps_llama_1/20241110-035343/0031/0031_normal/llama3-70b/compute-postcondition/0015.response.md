Let's break down the code step by step.

The code `numerator //= gcd` performs integer division of `numerator` by `gcd` and assigns the result back to `numerator`.

From the initial state, we know that `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. This means that `gcd` is a factor of both `numerator` and `denominator`.

When we divide `numerator` by `gcd`, we are essentially removing the common factor `gcd` from `numerator`. The result is a new value of `numerator` that is no longer divisible by `gcd`.

The value of `denominator` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the division operation.

The value of `gcd` also remains unchanged, as it is not reassigned or modified in any way.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `2` raised to the power of `n*k`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.**
