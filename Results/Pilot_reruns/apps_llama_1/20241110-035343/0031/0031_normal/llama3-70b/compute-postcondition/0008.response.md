Let's break down the code step by step:

* The code multiplies the `denominator` by `total_days`.
* The initial value of `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.
* The initial value of `total_days` is also 2 raised to the power of `n`.
* Therefore, the new value of `denominator` is (2^n) * (2^n) = 2^(2n).

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is (2^n) * (2^n - 1), `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of 2n, `i` is 1**
