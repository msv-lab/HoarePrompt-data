To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State:
- `numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.
- `denominator` is `2` raised to the power of `n*k`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.

Given Code:
```python
denominator //= gcd
```

This line of code performs integer division of `denominator` by `gcd` and assigns the result back to `denominator`. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, dividing `denominator` by `gcd` essentially removes the common factors between the original `numerator` and `denominator` from `denominator`.

However, since `numerator` has already been divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator` to obtain its current value, and `gcd` is that same greatest common divisor, the value of `numerator` remains unchanged. 

The value of `denominator` is updated to be `denominator` divided by `gcd`, but since `gcd` is a factor of `denominator`, this division does not introduce any new prime factors into `denominator`. It merely reduces the power of the prime factors that `denominator` and the original `numerator` have in common.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `numerator` remains the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.
- `denominator` is updated to be `2` raised to the power of `n*k` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.
- `gcd` remains the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `2` raised to the power of `n*k` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.**
