Output State: **The loop calculates the numerator and denominator of a fraction, where the numerator is the product of `total_days` minus `i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, and the denominator is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`. If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop executes `k` times, and `i` takes on values from 0 to `k-1`. The final values of `numerator` and `denominator` are `numerator` is the product of (2^n - i) for i from 0 to k-1, and `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n*k`.**
