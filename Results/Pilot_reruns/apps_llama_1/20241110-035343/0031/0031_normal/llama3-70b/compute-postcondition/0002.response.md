`denominator` is assigned the value 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `total_days`, and `numerator` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1**
