To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state of the variables.


The given code is a print statement that prints the values of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD`. The initial state of the variables is given as:


`numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003
`denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003
`p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003
`p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003
`p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003
`A` is (`p_shared` // `g`)
`B` is (`B` // `g`), where `B` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`


However, the code snippet given only includes a print statement. The print statement does not change the state of the variables, it only prints their values. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the values of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD` are printed.


Output State: **`numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `A` is (`p_shared` // `g`), `B` is (`B` // `g`), where `B` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`, and the values of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD` are printed.**
