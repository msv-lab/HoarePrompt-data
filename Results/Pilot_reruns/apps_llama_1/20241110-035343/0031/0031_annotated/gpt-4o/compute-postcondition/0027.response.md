The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The value of `n` is between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), and the value of `k` is between 2 and 10^18 (inclusive). 

After executing the function body, there are two possible cases:

Case_1: If `k` is greater than 2 to the power of `n`, the function prints 1, 1 and returns. 
Case_2: If `k` is not greater than 2 to the power of `n`, the function continues execution without printing or returning any value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return or print values based on the comparison between `k` and 2 to the power of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, returns or prints values based on the comparison between k and 2 to the power of n.**
