To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The code is `g = func_1(A, B)`. This line of code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `A` and `B`, and assigns the return value to `g`.

From the initial state, we know that `A` is equal to `p_shared`, which is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, and `B` is equal to `p_total`, which is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003.

However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the problem, so we cannot determine the exact value of `g`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `A` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `B` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `A` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `B` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`**
