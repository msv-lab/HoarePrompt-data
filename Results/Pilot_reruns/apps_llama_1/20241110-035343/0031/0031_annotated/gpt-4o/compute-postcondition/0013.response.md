According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is (2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003) * (2 to the power of `n` - 1) modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (2 * `n`) modulo 1,000,003, `i` is 2**
