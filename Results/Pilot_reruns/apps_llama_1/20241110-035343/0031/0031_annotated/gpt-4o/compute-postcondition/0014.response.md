To calculate the new value of `numerator`, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Calculate `total_days - i`: Since `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n` and `i` is 2, we have `total_days - i` = 2^n - 2.
2. Multiply `numerator` by `total_days - i`: The new value of `numerator` is the product of the original `numerator` and `total_days - i`.
3. Take the result modulo `MOD` (1,000,003): This ensures that the new value of `numerator` is within the range 0 to 1,000,002.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot calculate the exact value of `numerator`. However, we can express the new value of `numerator` in terms of the original values.

The original value of `numerator` is `(2 to the power of n modulo 1,000,003) * (2 to the power of n - 1) modulo 1,000,003`. Let's denote this value as `original_numerator`.

The new value of `numerator` is `original_numerator * (2^n - 2) modulo 1,000,003`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is `original_numerator * (2^n - 2) modulo 1,000,003`, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (2 * `n`) modulo 1,000,003, `i` is 2**
