The code `print(1, 1)` prints the values 1 and 1 to the console. This statement does not modify the values of any variables, so the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional action of printing 1 and 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1,000,003, and 1, 1 is printed**
