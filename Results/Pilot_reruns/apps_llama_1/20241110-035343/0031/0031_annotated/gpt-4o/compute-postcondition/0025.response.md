To determine the output state, we'll analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

The code snippet is `B //= g`. This operation performs integer division of `B` by `g` and assigns the result back to `B`.

From the initial state, we know that `B` is 2 to the power of `(k * n)`, modulo 1,000,003, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`. However, the exact value of `g` is not provided.

Since we don't know the exact value of `g`, we can't calculate the exact value of `B` after the operation. Nevertheless, we can express the new value of `B` in terms of its previous value and `g`.

The new value of `B` will be the integer division of its previous value by `g`. This can be represented as `B` is (`B` // `g`), where `B` is 2 to the power of `(k * n)`, modulo 1,000,003, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`.

The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `A` is (`p_shared` // `g`), `B` is (`B` // `g`), where `B` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`**
