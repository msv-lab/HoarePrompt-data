To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code `A //= g` performs integer division of `A` by `g` and assigns the result back to `A`. 

Given the initial state, `A` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, which is the same as `p_shared`. The value of `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`, but its exact value is not provided. However, we know that `g` is used to divide `A`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `g`, we cannot determine the exact value of `A` after the division. However, we can express the new value of `A` in terms of the old value of `A` and `g`. The new value of `A` is `A // g`, which means `A` is divided by `g` and the result is an integer.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `A` is (`p_shared` // `g`), `B` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(A, B)`**
