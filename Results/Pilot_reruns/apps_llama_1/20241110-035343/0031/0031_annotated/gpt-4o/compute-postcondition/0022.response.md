The code assigns the value of `p_total` to `B`. The initial state already defines the values of `numerator`, `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, and `A`. The value of `p_total` is used to assign a value to `B`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `A` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `B` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003**
