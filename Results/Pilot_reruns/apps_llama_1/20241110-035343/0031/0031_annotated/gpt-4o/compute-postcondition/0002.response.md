The function returns without a value (i.e., it returns `None` by default). The values of `n`, `k`, and `MOD` are not changed. The print statement "1, 1" has already been executed, so the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1,000,003, 1, 1 is printed, and the function returns `None`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1,000,003, 1, 1 is printed, and the function returns `None`**
