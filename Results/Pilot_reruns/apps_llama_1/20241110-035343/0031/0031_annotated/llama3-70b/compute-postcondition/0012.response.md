According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2. `k` being greater than 2 does ensure that the loop will execute again, but `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days * total_days * total_days`, and `i` is 3**
