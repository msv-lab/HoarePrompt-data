The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is `total_days * total_days`, so the new value of `denominator` is `(total_days * total_days) * total_days = total_days * total_days * total_days`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days * total_days * total_days`, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days * total_days * total_days`, and `i` is 2**
