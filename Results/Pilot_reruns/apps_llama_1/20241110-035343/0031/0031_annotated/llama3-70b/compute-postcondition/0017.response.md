The function returns two values: `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`. The values of `n`, `i`, `numerator`, `denominator`, and `gcd` do not change, so the output state is `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `k-1`, `numerator` is the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, and the function returns `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `k-1`, `numerator` is the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, and the function returns `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`.**
