To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the for loop statement. The loop iterates over the range of `k`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` to 1.

The other variables `n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` are not affected by the loop iteration, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is equal to `total_days`, `denominator` is equal to `total_days`, `i` is 1**
