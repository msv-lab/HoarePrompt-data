The code `denominator = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `denominator`. The initial state has variables `n`, `k`, `total_days`, and `numerator`, but the code only affects the new variable `denominator`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
