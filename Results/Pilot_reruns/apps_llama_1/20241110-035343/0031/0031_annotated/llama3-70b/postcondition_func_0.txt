The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, calculates the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` and the product of `total_days` repeated `k` times, and returns the remainder of the numerator divided by 10^6 + 3 and the remainder of the denominator divided by 10^6 + 3. However, the function may not behave as expected if `k` is 0, `n` is a large integer, or if `numerator` or `denominator` is 0.
