Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days, given that k people are interviewed. The program first checks if k is greater than the total number of days, in which case the probability is 1. Otherwise, it calculates the numerator and denominator of the probability of no shared birthdays, and then subtracts this from the total probability to get the probability of at least one shared birthday.

The program uses the modulo operation to avoid overflow and to ensure that the final result is within the required range. The use of the `func_1` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator ensures that the final result is in its simplest form.

I have not been able to find any case where the program does not work correctly, and the examples provided in the problem description all produce the expected results. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
