Correctness: **True**

I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python program, and I believe it correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the total number of days in a year, which is 2^n.
2. It handles the case where k > 2^n, in which case the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is 1, and prints the correct output (1, 1).
3. For the general case, the program calculates the probability of no shared birthdays (p_no_shared) and the total probability (p_total) using the correct formulas.
4. It then calculates the probability of at least one shared birthday (p_shared) by subtracting p_no_shared from p_total, taking care to handle the case where p_no_shared is greater than p_total (which can happen due to modular arithmetic).
5. The program reduces the fraction (p_shared, p_total) to its simplest form by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd), which is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm (func_1).
6. Finally, the program prints the reduced fraction (A, B) modulo 10^6 + 3, as required by the problem statement.

I have not found any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases like k > 2^n, and produces the correct output for all examples provided. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
