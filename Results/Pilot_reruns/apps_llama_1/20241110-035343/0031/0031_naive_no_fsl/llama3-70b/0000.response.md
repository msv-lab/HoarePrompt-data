Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday. The issue lies in the calculation of the numerator and denominator.

The numerator is calculated as the product of `total_days - i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. This is incorrect because it calculates the number of ways to assign different birthdays to `k` people, but it does not take into account the fact that the order of the birthdays does not matter.

The correct calculation for the numerator should be the total number of ways to assign birthdays to `k` people, minus the number of ways to assign different birthdays to `k` people.

The denominator is calculated as `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, which is correct.

To fix the program, the numerator should be calculated as `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, minus the product of `total_days - i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
4 3

Expected Output:
23 128

Actual Output:
(1, 64)

The program incorrectly calculates the numerator as 1, instead of 23.
