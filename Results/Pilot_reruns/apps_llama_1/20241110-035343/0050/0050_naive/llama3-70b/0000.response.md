Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where there are multiple opportunities to buy shares at different prices, and it is optimal to buy shares at a higher price to maximize the profit. The program only buys shares at the lowest price available, which may not be the optimal strategy.

For example, consider the input:

3 2 100
10 20 30
40 50

The program will buy shares at the price of 10, but it would be more optimal to buy shares at the price of 20, because the selling price of 50 is higher than the selling price of 40. The program does not consider this possibility and therefore does not produce the correct output.

The program should consider all possible combinations of buying and selling prices to find the optimal strategy, but it only considers buying at the lowest price and selling at the highest price, which is not sufficient to guarantee the maximum profit.
