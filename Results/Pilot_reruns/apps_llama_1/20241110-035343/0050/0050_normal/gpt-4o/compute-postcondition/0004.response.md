To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
max_sell_price = max(b)
```
The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `r` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of input integers
- `b` is a list of input integers
- `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`

Now, let's analyze the code snippet:
- The `max()` function returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.
- The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the value of the maximum integer in the list `b`.

Since the code snippet only affects the variable `max_sell_price`, the other variables remain unchanged.

The output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `r` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of input integers
- `b` is a list of input integers
- `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`
- `max_sell_price` is the maximum integer in `b`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum integer in `b`.**
