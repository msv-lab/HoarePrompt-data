To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:


Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1. The loop counter `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value of the range.


The other variables `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` do not affect the execution of the loop, so their states remain unchanged.


State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is an input positive integer, `r` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
