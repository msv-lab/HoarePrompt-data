Based on the given initial state and the code snippet, here is the output state:


The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is an input positive integer, `r` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
