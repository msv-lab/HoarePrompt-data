Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, and `i` is 2. If `r` is greater than or equal to the third element in the sorted list `s`, `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by the third element in `s`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is terminated.***
