To solve this task, let's break it down step by step:

1. The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in descending order. 
2. The initial state of `b` is a list of input integers, but its order is not specified.
3. After sorting, the list `b` will be in descending order.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `r` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `r` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order**
