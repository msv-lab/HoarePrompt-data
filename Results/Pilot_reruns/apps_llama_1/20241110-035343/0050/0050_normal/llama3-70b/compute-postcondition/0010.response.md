Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `i` is 0. If `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest integer in `s`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by the smallest integer in `s`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. Otherwise, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `shares` remaining 0.***
