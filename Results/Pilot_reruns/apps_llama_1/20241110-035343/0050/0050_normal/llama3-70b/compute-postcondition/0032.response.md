Postcondition: ***`n` is 0 or greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares` times the second element of `b` and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
