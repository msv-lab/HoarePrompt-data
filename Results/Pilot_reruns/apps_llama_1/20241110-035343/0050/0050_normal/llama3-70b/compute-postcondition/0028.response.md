To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is `i in range(m)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`. Since `i` is 0, it is already less than `m`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop condition only depends on `i` and `m`.

State: **`n` is 0 or greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `i` is 1**
