To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is: `shares += r // s[i]`

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is at least 1
- `m` is an input positive integer
- `s` is a sorted list of input integers
- `b` is a list of input integers in descending order
- `i` is 1

However, we are missing the value of `r` and `shares` in the initial state. Since they are not provided, we will consider them as unknown values.

Now, let's analyze the code snippet:
- `r // s[i]` calculates the integer division of `r` by the second element of the sorted list `s` (since `i` is 1, and list indices start at 0).
- The result of the integer division is added to `shares`.

Since we don't know the values of `r` and `shares`, we can't calculate the exact value of `shares` after the execution. However, we can describe the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `shares` is increased by `r // s[1]`**
