Postcondition: ***`n` is 0 or greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to be the original `r` plus `shares` times the largest element in `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the loop breaks. In both cases, `i` remains 0.***
