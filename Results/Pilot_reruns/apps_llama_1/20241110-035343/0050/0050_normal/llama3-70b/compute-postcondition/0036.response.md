The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
