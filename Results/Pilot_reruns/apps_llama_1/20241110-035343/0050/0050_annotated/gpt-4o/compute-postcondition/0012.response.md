Based on the provided code and annotations, I will describe the functionality of the function.

The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it takes input from the user in the form of three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and two lists of integers `s` and `b` with lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.

The function calculates the minimum buy price from the list `s` and the maximum sell price from the list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, the function prints the value of `r`. 

Otherwise, the function calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buy price, the remaining amount after buying the shares, and the total amount that can be obtained by selling the shares at the maximum sell price and adding the remaining amount. The function then prints the total amount.

Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for the number of buy prices, the number of sell prices, and an amount of money, as well as the buy and sell prices. It calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price, and if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the amount of money. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining amount, and the total amount that can be obtained by selling the shares and prints the total amount. **
