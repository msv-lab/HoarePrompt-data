`max_sell_price` is assigned the value of the maximum integer in `b`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`.**
