The value of `b` is reassigned to a list of integers obtained from the input. The `input()` function accepts a string of space-separated integers, and `split()` splits this string into a list of strings. The `map(int,...)` function converts each string in the list to an integer, and `list(...)` converts the resulting map object to a list.

The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, and `b` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, and `b` is a list of input integers**
