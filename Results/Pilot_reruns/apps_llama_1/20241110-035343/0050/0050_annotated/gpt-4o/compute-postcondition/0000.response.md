The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are reassigned based on the input. The `input()` function accepts a string of space-separated values, and the `split()` method splits this string into a list of strings. The `map(int,...)` function converts each string in the list to an integer. 

The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are now the input integers. The states of the other variables, `s` and `b`, are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers, `s` is a list of n positive integers, and `b` is a list of m positive integers**
