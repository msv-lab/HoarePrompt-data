To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is: `total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `r` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of input integers
- `b` is a list of input integers
- `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`
- `max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`
- `max_shares` is `r` divided by `min_buy_price` (integer division)
- `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`

Now, let's calculate the value of `total_bourles`:
- `max_shares * max_sell_price` is the product of the maximum number of shares that can be bought and the maximum selling price.
- Adding `remaining_bourles` to this product gives the total bourles.

The output state will include the new variable `total_bourles` and its calculated value, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`, `max_shares` is `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`**
