To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
`n` is an input integer, 
`m` is an input integer, 
`r` is an input integer, 
`s` is a list of input integers, 
`b` is a list of input integers, 
`min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, 
`max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`, 
`max_shares` is `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, 
`remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`, 
and `total_bourles` is `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`

The code is:
```
print(total_bourles)
```
This code simply prints the value of `total_bourles`.

Since `total_bourles` is already calculated and stored in the initial state, the code does not change the state of any variables. It only prints the value of `total_bourles`.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `total_bourles` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`, `max_shares` is `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles` is printed**
