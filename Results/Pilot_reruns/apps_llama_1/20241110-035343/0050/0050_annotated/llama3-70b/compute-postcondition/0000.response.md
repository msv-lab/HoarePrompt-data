The code snippet uses the `map` function to convert the input values to integers and assign them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `r`. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings separated by whitespace, and the `map` function applies the `int` function to each string in the list, converting them to integers.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30 and 1 <= m <= 30, and `r` is a positive integer such that 1 <= r <= 1000, the new values of `n`, `m`, and `r` will be input integers that satisfy these conditions.

The output state will be the new values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, which are input integers. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of n positive integers, and `b` is a list of m positive integers**
