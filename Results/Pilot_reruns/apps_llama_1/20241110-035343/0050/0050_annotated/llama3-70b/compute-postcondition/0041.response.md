Based on the provided information, I will describe the functionality of the function.

The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30 and 1 <= m <= 30, respectively. `r` is a positive integer such that 1 <= r <= 1000. `s` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= s_i <= 1000 for all `i`. `b` is a list of `m` positive integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 1000 for all `i`.

However, since the output of the function is not provided, I will leave the return value description empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, s, and b, where n and m are positive integers between 1 and 30, r is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of n positive integers between 1 and 1000, and b is a list of m positive integers between 1 and 1000.**
