To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for i in range(m):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `r` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- `m` is greater than 0
- `s` is a sorted list of stock prices
- `b` is unchanged
- `i` is 0

Since `i` is 0 and the loop is `for i in range(m):`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1. Also, since `m` is the upper limit of the range, `m` should be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`r` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is a sorted list of stock prices, `b` is unchanged, `i` is 1**
