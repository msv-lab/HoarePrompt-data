To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30
- `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30
- `s` is a sorted list of input integers
- `b` is a list of `m` input integers in descending order
- `i` is 2
- `shares` is increased by `r // s[2]`

The code is:
```python
r %= s[i]
```
This code calculates the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]` and assigns it back to `r`.

Since `i` is 2, `s[i]` is the third element in the sorted list `s`. The value of `r` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but we know that `r` is being updated.

The output state is:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30
- `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30
- `s` is a sorted list of input integers
- `b` is a list of `m` input integers in descending order
- `i` is 2
- `shares` is increased by `r // s[2]`
- `r` is the remainder of its previous value divided by `s[2]`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of `m` input integers in descending order, `i` is 2, `shares` is increased by `r // s[2]`, and `r` is the remainder of its previous value divided by `s[2]`.**
