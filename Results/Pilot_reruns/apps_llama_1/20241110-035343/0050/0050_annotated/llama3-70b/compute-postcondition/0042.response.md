The function func accepts no parameters but takes input from the user in the form of three integers n, m, and r, and two lists s and b of n and m integers respectively. 

The function first sorts the list s in ascending order and the list b in descending order. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the amount r by iteratively dividing r by the stock prices in the sorted list s and adding the quotient to the total shares. 

After that, it calculates the total amount of money that can be retrieved from selling shares and adds it to the remaining amount r. 

Finally, it prints the total amount of money that can be retrieved.
