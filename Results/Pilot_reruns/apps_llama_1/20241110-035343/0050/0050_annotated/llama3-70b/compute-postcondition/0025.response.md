The code `shares = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `shares`. Since `shares` is already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`r` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is a sorted list of stock prices, `b` is unchanged, `i` is 0**
