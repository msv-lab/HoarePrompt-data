To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the for loop statement and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for i in range(m):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. Since `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop condition only depends on `i` and `m`.

State: **`r` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is a sorted list of stock prices, `b` is unchanged, and `i` is 2.**
