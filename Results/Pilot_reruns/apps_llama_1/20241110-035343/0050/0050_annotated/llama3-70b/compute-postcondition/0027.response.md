Postcondition: ***`r` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is a sorted list of stock prices, `b` is unchanged, `i` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares` times `b[i]` and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is terminated.***
