Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of `m` input integers in descending order, and `i` is 2. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[2]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[2]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of its previous value divided by `s[2]`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is terminated. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the if-else block.***
