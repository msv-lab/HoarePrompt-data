Output State: **`r` is printed to the console, and the state of the variables remains unchanged: `r` contains the total amount of money that can be retrieved, `i` is `m` if the loop executes `m` times or the index of the stock price in `b` that corresponds to the last share sold if the loop terminates early, and `n`, `m`, `s`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
