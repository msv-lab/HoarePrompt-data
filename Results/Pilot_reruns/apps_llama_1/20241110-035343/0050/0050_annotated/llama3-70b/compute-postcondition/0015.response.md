Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of `m` input integers in descending order, `i` is 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the previous `r` divided by `s[i]`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is terminated, leaving `r` unchanged and `shares` unchanged at 0.***
