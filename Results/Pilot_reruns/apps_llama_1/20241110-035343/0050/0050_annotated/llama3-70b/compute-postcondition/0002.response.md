`b` is reassigned the value of a list of `m` input integers. The previous value of `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, but it is overwritten. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of `m` input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of `m` input integers**
