Postcondition: ***`r` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is a sorted list of stock prices, `b` is unchanged, and `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving all variables unchanged.***
