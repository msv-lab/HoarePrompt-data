To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is a simple `for` loop that iterates over a range of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` needs to be greater than the new value of `i`.

No other states (`m`, `s`, `b`, `r`, `shares`) are directly related to the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of `m` input integers in descending order, `i` is 2**
