Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when one of the numbers is zero and the other is not. For example, if the input is:

0
9

The program will print "=" because it strips the leading zero from the first number, making it an empty string, which is considered equal to any other string in Python. However, the correct output should be "<" because 0 is less than 9.

Another case where the program fails is when the input numbers have different lengths. For example, if the input is:

123
1234

The program will print "=" because it compares the strings lexicographically, but it should print "<" because 123 is less than 1234.

The program should compare the lengths of the numbers before comparing them lexicographically to handle these cases correctly.
