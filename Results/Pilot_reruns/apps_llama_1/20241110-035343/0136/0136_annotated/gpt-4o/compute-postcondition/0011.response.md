The code `print('=')` prints the string '=' to the console, but it does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `data`. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with no leading zeroes, and `data` is a list of substrings separated by whitespace from the input string. If either `a` or `b` is an empty string, it is set to `'0'`, otherwise they remain unchanged, and '=' is printed to the console.
