The code `a = data[0].lstrip('0')` removes leading zeroes from the first substring in the `data` list and assigns it to `a`. 

Since `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, possibly with leading zeroes, and each containing no more than 10^6 digits, the removal of leading zeroes from `a` will result in a string that still represents a non-negative integer, but with no leading zeroes.

The state of `b` and `data` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with no leading zeroes, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer, possibly with leading zeroes, and `data` is a list of substrings separated by whitespace from the input string**
