Based on the provided information, I will describe the functionality of the function `func_1`.


The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, possibly with leading zeroes, and each containing no more than 10^6 digits.


Since there is no output description provided, I will assume that the output is not specified or is not relevant to the functionality description.


Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `a` and `b`, each representing a non-negative integer with a maximum of 10^6 digits.


Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters a and b, each representing a non-negative integer with a maximum of 10^6 digits.**
