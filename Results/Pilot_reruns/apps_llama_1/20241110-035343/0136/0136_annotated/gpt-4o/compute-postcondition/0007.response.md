The code prints the string '<'. This operation does not affect the state of the variables `a`, `b`, or `data`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with no leading zeroes, and `data` is a list of substrings separated by whitespace from the input string. If either `a` or `b` is an empty string, it is set to `'0'`, otherwise they remain unchanged. The string '<' has been printed.
