The function func_1 accepts two string parameters a and b, each representing a non-negative integer with a maximum of 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes. It first removes any leading zeroes from a and b. If either a or b is an empty string after removing leading zeroes, it is set to '0'. Then, it compares the lengths of a and b. If the length of a is less than the length of b, it prints '<'. If the length of a is greater than the length of b, it prints '>'. If the lengths are equal, it compares a and b lexicographically. If a is lexicographically less than b, it prints '<'. If a is lexicographically greater than b, it prints '>'. If a and b are lexicographically equal, it prints '='.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two string parameters a and b, each representing a non-negative integer with a maximum of 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes, removes leading zeroes, and prints '<', '>', or '=' based on the lengths and lexicographical order of a and b. **
