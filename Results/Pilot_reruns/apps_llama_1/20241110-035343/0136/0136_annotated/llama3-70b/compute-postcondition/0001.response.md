The code `b = input().lstrip('0')` assigns a new value to `b`. The `input()` function accepts a new input string, and the `lstrip('0')` method removes leading zeroes from this input string. The previous value of `b` is not used in this assignment.

The state of `a` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a new input string with leading zeroes removed**
