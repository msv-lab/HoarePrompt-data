The value of `a` is reassigned to the result of `input().lstrip('0')`. The `input()` function accepts a string input, and `lstrip('0')` removes leading zeroes from the input string. The previous value of `a` is a string representing a non-negative integer, possibly with leading zeroes, but it is overwritten by the new input. The state of `b` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer, possibly with leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer, possibly with leading zeroes**
