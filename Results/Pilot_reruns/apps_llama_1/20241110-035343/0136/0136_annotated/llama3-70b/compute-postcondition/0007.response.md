Based on the provided information, here's my analysis:


The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers, possibly with leading zeroes.


However, there is no output information provided. To complete the functionality description, I would need the output details. Please provide the output information, and I'll be happy to help.


If you provide the output details, I'll describe the functionality of the function in the required format.
