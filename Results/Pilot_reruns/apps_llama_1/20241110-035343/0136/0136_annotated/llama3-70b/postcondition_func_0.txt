The function accepts two input strings, removes leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the strings are equal, '<' if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second. However, the function does not handle cases where the input strings are not numeric or contain non-digit characters. Additionally, the function does not provide any output or return value if the input strings are not valid numbers.
