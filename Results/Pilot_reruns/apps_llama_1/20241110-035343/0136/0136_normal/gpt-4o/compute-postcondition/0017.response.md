The function func_1 accepts two input strings a and b, representing non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes. The function removes leading zeroes from both strings and compares them. If the lengths of the strings are different, the function prints '>' if the length of a is greater, '<' if the length of b is greater. If the lengths are the same, the function compares the strings lexicographically and prints '>' if a is greater, '<' if b is greater, and '=' if they are equal. This covers all possible cases, including when a or b (or both) are '0', and when a and b have the same length or different lengths.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two input strings a and b, representing non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes, removes leading zeroes, and compares them based on length and lexicographical order, printing '<', '>', or '=' accordingly. **
