The code prints the string '<' to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `data` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `b` is the string `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `data` is a list of two input strings, and the string '<' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `b` is the string `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `data` is a list of two input strings, and the string '<' is printed to the console.**
