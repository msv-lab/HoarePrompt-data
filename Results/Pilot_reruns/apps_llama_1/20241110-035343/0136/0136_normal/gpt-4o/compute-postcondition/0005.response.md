The value of `b` is assigned to `'0'`, regardless of its previous value. The state of `a` and `data` is not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `b` is '0', and `data` is a list of two input strings.

Output State: **`a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `b` is '0', and `data` is a list of two input strings.**
