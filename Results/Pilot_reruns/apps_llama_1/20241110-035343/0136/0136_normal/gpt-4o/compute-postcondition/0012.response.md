Postcondition: ***`a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `b` is the string `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, and `data` is a list of two input strings. The program prints '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, otherwise it prints '='.***
