The code removes leading zeroes from the string `data[0]` and assigns the result to `a`. The state of `b` and `data` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes, `data` is a list of two input strings**
