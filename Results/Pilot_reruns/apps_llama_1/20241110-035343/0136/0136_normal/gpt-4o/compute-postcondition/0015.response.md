Postcondition: ***`a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `b` is the string `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, and `data` is a list of two input strings. After the execution, the program prints '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b` or if `a` has a shorter length than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b` or if `a` has a greater length than `b`, and '=' if `a` and `b` are lexicographically equal, covering all possible cases including when `a` or `b` (or both) are '0', and when `a` and `b` have the same length or different lengths.***
